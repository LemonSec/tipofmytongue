now when I got when I joined that came

39
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:13,069
I had and cultural hurdle that I had to
get in front because they were think

40
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:13,989
that the team

41
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,959
did together that I might not be
interested in

42
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:23,360
though but and as it's grown am have
been in my career about 15 years now

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,840

and fell to see that change where are
the only woman in it.

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,239
form when a hearty crowd now it's really
am

47
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,840
it's really encouraging I think in

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,910
thing from no I'm

49
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,440
I've been in the industry for me
twelve-year and actually

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,910
been working on a book I would describe
my

51
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,170

poison saw targeted by penetration have

56
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,379
Don doc and partly by automated dialing
impact from him that mean

57
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:23,400
where ridicule shine mock

58
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,129
but do sexually harassed if waited

59
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:30,549
rocket here's hearted by morning packard

60
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,440

question I'm still here and common

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,890

00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,390
Madrid

63
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,989
on I guess not waited and hmmm

64
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:47,980
intensive Diane and consulting but I
remember one of my first meeting

65
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,400
that I was leading by myself the

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,680
on the company actually got I would the
secretary

67
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,549
and I could get copy hmm so I think now

68
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:01,730
there's band increase awareness in

69
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,200
women security and women in tech general
where

70
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:13,200
secretary good

71
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:16,580
who are you fit you probably have the
most great years have been

72
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,340
women's panel I'm mean I've been

73
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,220
around a little bit longer not
necessarily in the IT industry

74
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,500
specifically but am involved with some

75
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,220
forma technology moved to the last
thirty years

76
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,600
in you know

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,840
college I remember having to Canon

78
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,240
that wiring looking

79
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,110
over in the corner where all these guys
were around that machine that was

80
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,419
making he and happen we own

81
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:57,080
tape would not power on the floor in how
wonder you got it now looks interesting

82
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,530
but

83
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,840
they'd laugh at me I walked over there
in

84
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,759
yes what was going on knitted hand that
happen my best friend in college again

85
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,509
it was a

86
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:09,530
to know on Apple you know a volleyball
player

87
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,880
together she wasn't a computer science
major

88
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,590
and highways you know why she ever got

89
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,250
people or been involved in in and

90
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,100
today she's actually an environmental
engineer nothing to do with really

91
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,960
computers

92
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,789
Union at the time I was in a an
education major

93
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:33,330
and now I'm very much involved in
computers no

94
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,729
mike hanna to this freer hand tumors

95
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:40,220
through you know having a deep interest
but

96
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,860
kinda been scared about being involved
with what was going on around the corner

97
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,550
the library

98
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,639
up to now be you know did under

99
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,490
and I think you think probably all of us
have experienced some the same

100
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,940
no difficulty getting where we are but
on

101
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,500
on the positive side I think probably
all the have some characteristic sabine

102
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,110
clearly on your comp a new nursing homes

103
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,400
we haven't been shy about

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,750
state your position we're other people

105
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,509
noonan in and I think they're you know
con

106
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,960
mmm some armor that we have we have to
wear

107
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,660
over the years to get when said

108
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,669
so since we raise the issue great here
you can probably guess

109
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,729
I've been for a few years now and

110
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:35,000
when I started out there were no women
that I worked with and

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,190
at the two weeks ago accepted a new
position working for

112
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,850
she security officers meeting and she is
in fact woman

113
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,430
and that represents a pretty big pic on
a change for me

114
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,009
and what I perceive in in terms of how
things are changing

115
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,180
and it is a journey we're not there yet
but

116
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,430
we're getting there for making progress
you think a lot of that comes from

117
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,560
you know I've heard that we we've
mistaken for secretary of a new country

118
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,319
think then

119
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,130
pardo our role you know in women in the
organizations as you know I'm reading an

120
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,190
organization

121
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,880
security organization my now in stepping
up into

122
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,550
not automatically assuming the role so

123
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,599
I mean I will be the first person to
admit when we talk about planning a

124
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:19,550
lunch meeting

125
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,900
I get right to it I have great to it I'm

126
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,240
I have people that work for me because
absolutely do that and I don't know why

127
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,500
I feel compelled

128
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,560
to step up and do that but that it
wanted a hurdle that I think that we put

129
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,030
our own found then

130
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,190
or that I know that I have personally
but my own now been

131
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,970
you know nah nah not today yes we've had
we overcome

132
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,440
some some abs some hurdles but we've
created our own

133
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,500
as well so and taking the time to step
up and play I don't

134
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,440
need to do that kind of activity I don't
need to

135
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,180
the printer we can call somebody to take
care jammed people paper in the printer

136
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,340
and I'm sorry that the copy services and
up to your standard wanted to call her

137
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,199
body

138
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,419
so and I do think that a good portion
our

139
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:08,009
moving up in into security roles were in
technology and

140
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:11,110
as a whole is letting go that notion
that you happy

141
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,310
care take your office I I don't care
take my office staff in

142
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,930
in fact I think in my role

143
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,370
my the wordy kinda position has helped
me to set that honey caretaking

144
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,819
and you the you know really into
thinking that maybe we could hear from

145
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:29,419
her mother

146
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:32,709
ok time to me and i i would agree with
you to either as a

147
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:37,039
beautiful time working mother and the
authority figure and my publication I'm

148
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,339
often feel compelled to organize for
other than take on that role so

149
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,060
does anyone else feel that dont want
that that can sometimes be a challenge

150
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,350
or may be counter to that have you spent
your to your career being hell bent on

151
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,880
breaking that stereotype

152
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,959
man think they feel and well

153
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,140
at that happened have my back from

154
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,920
him many of my early crap crew years

155
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,190
one actually in education in I was I'm

156
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,880
actually happen to coach and was a head
coach Joe

157
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,260
my several woman for the PM

158
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,029
home park home in particular and and
that those killed

159
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:20,110
have help me agree

160
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,839
you overtime to I'm yesterday

161
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,050
to be organ to delegate

162
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,170
to home have assistant coaches or other
people

163
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,570
do things that I needed them to do just
because

164
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,720
as a leadership position I'm

165
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,820
I need to be more focused on the task at
him then

166
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,899
worrying about you don't want to Reims
Reims for

167
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,180
the team after the game hmm and so I
think

168
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,250
I'm have those experiences

169
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,260
early in my career formed my

170
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,720
you know the basis for them how I'm been
able to

171
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,980
to mmm actin other leadership ruled

172
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,079
in I just in neatly I haven't felt like
I needed that make the coffee

173
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,690
or maneuverings yet but I really think
that keen

174
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,779
from super early I'm in my career was
non

175
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:23,410
what we're worry would not need to be in
yeah I think you told me her decision

176
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,560
if that was an expectation some you

177
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,560
did those things million

178
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,670
I started in ninety as an admin let me
but that hardly getting rid of that with

179
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,920
with with mister mmm yeah I

180
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,240
I having had a common

181
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,730
good right now I'm not like that I think
that maybe

182
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,829
written only hmm on when one who the UN

183
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:52,540
right yeah I'm I'm coming I like to
maybe bring up is

184
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,450
you know dr. in 30 year like
male-dominated industry

185
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,829
you can have some problems with
different about the IT industry for

186
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:04,240
maybe some other industry I think that
wanna

187
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,130
on other words industries to work for
the woman is Mike

188
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,209
financial industry to 30 then

189
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:14,589
by in that industry there's a lot more
women

190
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:18,010
then our but that have time me no have
to deal with them

191
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,450
be in actually here and you know local
promoted

192
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,700
up like that by on I think maybe

193
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,990
35-year maybe they'll be more women

194
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,899
in orange you can pick happen going to
have to deal with that

195
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,329
for why and i really wanna contributing

196
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:38,480
like backers why it so hard for real

197
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,490
ninety maybe like

198
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,480
I'm an admin inner usually an app no
they dont added

199
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,589
deal with women anyway golan may have to
work with them

200
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,660
you know that happen good at it and
maybe I've been like this third in mind

201
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,680
that would defend the humor

202
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,779
not kinda goes along with I think people
in I P anyway

203
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:05,800
you know the pool like you got no work
for a week wanna

204
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,120
everybody you know for everything now

205
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,230
if your girl you gonna get hit with a M
you know

206
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,459
gonna you know make me think

207
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,470
for maybe a big more than I think I p.m.
more casual

208
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:23,190
I think a better way a kinda catching it
is that I P organization

209
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,660
tend to be more casual right there
finance organization

210
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,329
my you perhaps consulting in an area
where I P consulting

211
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:35,360
is more formal because it is a
professional services

212
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,579
type organization and her be a little
less

213
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:43,870
and that jumpin' and what have you

214
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,870
but I actually don't feel like we we
have it all that bad I actually find

215
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,329
that an IP

216
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:54,600
I think given the casual nature the
environment I think

217
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,139
you're allowed to have more better
relationships with your work

218
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:02,959
with the people that you work with and I
think that as a whole

219
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,250
when you have relationships with people
when you're able to work with them

220
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,940
you don't yeah I think you don't
encounter and much stereotyping

221
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,240
because you're an you know you're
somebody that they work with and they

222
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,399
now in a

223
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,519
I every I actually you know certainly
I've had my

224
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,660
my fair share team outing to strip club

225
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,850
that kinda the high ground not back
didn't you naked

226
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,200
could independent the whole on

227
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,370
I actually did don't think that my

228
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,470
career progression had effort at all

229
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,370
from you know I don't feel like I've
ever been held back for ever been

230
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,260
manipulated her you know in any kinda
fashion

231
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,699
on report limit more about relationships
you with

232
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:53,300
with the people and that you work with
an army we were it is still a

233
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,040
male-dominated industry

234
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,779
have been you had meant word over the
course of your career

235
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:02,420
heavy typically made a point to ego
female mentors

236
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,540
what do you think it's just as important
were equally has

237
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,199
valuable to have man admin towards in
your career

238
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,470
the month paradigm maybe on something
wrong

239
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,820
work with that I'm I mean if I can say
anything

240
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,560
to kinda crime now to growth in industry
never get involved and when you work

241
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,029
with

242
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:23,180
I've never shot worry and I'm yeah
everybody them

243
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,339
you lose respect you go that route

244
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,699
mom I think that grodin injury when they
come across in a big girl

245
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:35,760
like from him they mean 909 you know hun
liane i've been welcoming

246
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,180
other ground sometimes and I'm the
running a female

247
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,180
men porn it like on you know

248
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,370
eternity maybe he's gonna be friendly
hume ABC

249
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,589
Pune opponent you know looking at very
and

250
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,540
competitive could have its challenges
okay I'm

251
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,310
my mid I i think when it comes to
speaking on a mentor I'm not sure that

252
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,310
am I would speak out a woman mentor

253
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,730
to because he would wake me I my

254
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,930
your mentor isn't meant to be your
friend they're not they should be

255
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,170
somebody that can help your career mine

256
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,800
when the first people security I worked
for and you know it

257
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,930
somebody that you can't record have
really candid conversations with an

258
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,959
and so I don't necessarily think that I
would

259
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:24,589
the now on a woman a mentor because
she's the woman I N E

260
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:27,730
somebody that can help me navigate

261
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,779
the direction of my career I

262
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:34,759
napping said I mean I'm open to
mentoring other women in the field

263
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,959
but it would only have to be because
there's some sort of national connection

264
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,160
I feel

265
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,699
like they have the same and driving
motivation that I have because I think

266
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:43,820
ultimately

267
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,839
it the driving motivation that make you
go places and I don't really think that

268
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,190
gender will keep you or promote you any
fatter

269
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,000
my in I concur 11 early

270
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,220
mentors was a now doctor movie a beer

271
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,420
and her mother was issue shoes

272
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,670
I would say maybe and 25 you learn I was

273
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:11,240
have been in the industry a long time in
her modeling and

274
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,509
she's going home with the bastard
newtonian

275
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:19,930
you know she she I'm with exactly that
person she

276
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:24,040
she understood the beams politics she
knew the plea that could be an industry

277
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,930
in which she was

278
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,579
home and I learned those drinks from her

279
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:33,279
you learned in when I need to keep my my
mouth shut and

280
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,529
needed when I needed to play along when
it was okay to say no and one who should

281
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:39,509
be in range

282
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:43,199

290
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:12,939

are agree I had that ball

291
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:17,130
probably home male and female mentors
impact you still have one

292
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,880
know that I really home he's my good 10

293
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,620
things are human doctor beaners

294
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,240
is no retired Adm you doing some more
open

295
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,150
northern Minnesota wanna I i still
actually do contact from

296
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,360
and so you know what do you think about
them

297
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,960
you mention she's been you know able

298
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,160
enormously my husband has been another
person that I've been able to bone

299
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,809
things up you know from you get from
your perspective on it

300
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:52,179
that's been hopeful I Lydia human you
know you don't love me

301
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:55,770
she had before good

302
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,360
that yeah I think that is the most
important thing you want to choose

303
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,260
mentor that you can be candid with and
trust that your candor seldom

304
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,160
confident male-female I don't think that
matter so much

305
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,789
although I will say having a diverse
perspective that you bring in with your

306
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,809
mentorship

307
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:16,010
is really important and your best ever
getting that is to have diverse

308
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,110
mentors including men and women that
doesn't necessarily mean you can't have

309
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,490
one

310
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,750
primary mentor I would encourage
everyone to have

311
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:28,030
someone who's your go to person desi
perspectives from other people to trust

312
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,049
as well

313
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:34,559
me thank you yeah offer just add that I
think that and the woman particularly in

314
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,669
any field really

315
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:39,890
and I think women are more compatible to
how people receive them

316
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,250
then I think oppenheim been mentoring
conversation Mendo

317
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,559
fine it down and your conversation with
Mike Brown

318
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,039
you not being received well or I think
people

319
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,160
suspect you you know and being your back
you know

320
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,110
I I don't think many counter that no
part of having mac

321
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,620
that diversity is is getting a a good
broad

322
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,910
that the power people receiving it
because that's how you

323
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,590
ultimately can make change it to the way
you move through your career

324
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,960
and understanding that whether or not
you intend to you how you're being

325
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,280
received is important

326
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,809
in terms of developing your career hmmm

327
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:19,330
well for who I would love to go shooting
range thinking maybe

328
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,730
my I'm for me in my experience

329
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,840
really annoying 1/2 for me you people in
the industry I feel like I have to walk

330
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,190
around my resume

331
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,049
I like email a plan for they can read it
for makin immediately fired

332
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:36,270
and treating me respectfully I feel like
when I meet people

333
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,200
like I'm rebooting the machine are all
over again yeah I work in this industry

334
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,919
and have been in the ministry long time
%um bad you know like

335
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,240
I didn't have to go through everything
again because that an initial

336
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,620
expectation for people

337
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,120
I don't know it but it you know who
actually and

338
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,880
Mike like that no I think that's really
annoying

339
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,450
I currently like happily start all over
again every time I

340
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,659
and renew be in a group of people

341
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:08,270
now from

342
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,460
take me back even further than the
career mean what

343
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,700
can be done especially these days home

344
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,299
you know an earlier level not even if
the educational

345
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:22,159
onto foster the idea that you know young
women

346
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,580
should be interested in a career these
days and that you know in the second

347
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,100
or even just IP is something that more
women should consider the education

348
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,020
yeah I so my I education or by trade

349
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,940
I would and not at all related

350
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,340
technology your security particular
think wanted

351
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,130
mean Leawood which I get can be

352
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,929
where female-dominated where
proportionally higher

353
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:53,940
more you know for pack overlapping
aspect is

354
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,100
women aren't willing to jumping in

355
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,650
and left her sister men are

356
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,880
not just got like doesn't matter if it's
right or wrong they just want to talk

357
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,840
they just want to get out there and its
part technology they just want to start

358
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,030
playing with it

359
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,240
women are more cautious like I don't
wanna break it I don't want

360
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,880
to do something wrong in that war on

361
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,150
I think there's the Kappa we have to
tell women it's okay to play

362
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,720
it's okay to make me day I'm your point
being perceived Iran

363
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,059
you know you're making the peak in your
learning that's fine your not being

364
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:29,090
perceived as

365
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:33,270
you know left educated or less
intelligent less informed

366
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:37,890
on and I think not the gap that often
keeps women back from

367
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,960
industries like technology on or

368
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,150
engineering not a security

369
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,980
that ability to play without fear and
rejection

370
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,510
mmm-hmm good ok

371
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,720
I don't recommend industry for NASCAR

372
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,840
really good you can that would eliminate

373
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,039
if you were going to go out and you were
my daughter

374
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:06,429
I'm in LA again wanted to be like
opportunity for me because I want to be

375
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:08,070
like mommy you're like no way

376
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,940
not going to man I am NOT not acted in
the morning

377
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,539
ummm I could be anyone I couldn't meet
gotten be done in like three other girl

378
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:17,580
who got Ruby

379
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,770
why did it have to be parted like mine
job playing with my go-to then

380
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,890
come and gone a long time let me
something that common injury

381
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,280
Anna the now you hungry

382
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,280
I'm going to happen you know counter
soccer maybe

383
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,470
changing culture who

384
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,669
the company reported in the education
industry

385
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:42,429
and we provided soccer for schools to

386
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:45,799
to run their business people public
school

387
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:50,720
and we look at our development
population we read about 20 percent of

388
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,210
our

389
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,620
on heard moment forces is women

390
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,049
I'm gonna say the average a department

391
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:03,200
42 20 6 30 so poorly young group

392
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,330
home in we're very interested in looking
at why

393
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,610
you know why we only have 20 percent we
would like to have more

394
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:14,200
in particularly you know education
industry is not only woman

395
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,159
their arms study done in 2010 by the
American Association

396
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,780
you University Women and I i wouldnt
really recommend anyone is interested in

397
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,700
growing

398
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,890
their program to attract more women

399
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,650
it was called why so few 31

400
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:35,559
on and objectively the communication was
that

401
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:39,230
you know the industry in general has 20
percent women

402
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,179
how can we how can we don't have too
many United he

403
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:47,470
well are farm team is still twenty
percent women

404
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,799
%um you really need to always back to
middle school

405
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:55,720
each young young girl you boys

406
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,940
you at the middle school age in rule
Easter pushing to get them involved

407
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,000
you know stem activities science
technology engineering and maintenance

408
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,520
neck mercury moon is what you PTEN

409
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,059
Omar potential employees

410
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:14,990
appear if your employer or college
person looking to attract

411
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,150
undergrad I think the answer to

412
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,419
the low number of women in IP

413
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:25,770
is really the low number of women in
missed and careers

414
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:29,549
and if we want to improve that and

415
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:33,120
should get during prime numbers you
nighty

416
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,380
what we need to do is being you doing
outreach to

417
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,830
schools that need who use

418
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,909
for more dinos been providing leadership
opportunities for girls and young women

419
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:49,830
in that early years middle school
onlooker perhaps even elementary school

420
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,100
home and in start that way and so

421
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,059
I do agree with Carey in that it will be
a while until we get there

422
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,350
but it be home this reason we needed
we're

423
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:05,520
earlier than we are it it you know more
kids that are leaving high school going

424
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,630
to college

425
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,320
and ball getting involved in in
engineering careers

426
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,960
and we're going to have more on people
one from New Year

427
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,799
the workforce did I agree with
everything you just said in

428
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:20,900
I'm working in that direction myself but
also Wed

429
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,500
I wouldn't let that stand in our way
being

430
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,610
proactive about recruiting in the here
and now to

431
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,870
do serve have it with

432
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:35,059
corporate America where we feel like we
have to recruit people

433
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:39,419
skills that we need and after that those
killed before they come on board

434
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,610
FB impact for the moment they arrive
well

435
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,890
and also to serve Cameron Boyce Mar
employer

436
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,039
mine because they don't exist respected
compaq

437
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,970
compact was very clear about this we
recruit for skilled with fire people for

438
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,640
attitude

439
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,080
and so how about if we change the
paradigm a little bit

440
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,610
and we recruit people for attitude and
aptitude in interest

441
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,740
and say here's a person woman

442
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,520
minority some groups that we already
have for under-represented in the

443
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,650
situation

444
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,020
and say they've got the the round

445
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,250
packaged personality that were looking
for but they don't have the exact

446
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,220
school so i'm looking for. let's make an
investment in a friend

447
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,100
but recruitment hire them and give them
education and training

448
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,080
so they refer to the job I agree with
everything you just said in fact I'm

449
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,880
volunteering at a local magnet school to
week sessions and cybersecurity get

450
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,980
kids engaged in it it's a magnet school
that is particularly games for girls and

451
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,580
minorities

452
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,520
so a making that effort to to poor
people in

453
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,409
but I also think there's an urgent
near-term play that we need to engage in

454
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:50,960
room for the ready to talk about
benefits and children part I think our

455
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,230
problem is that when women drop out of
the workforce

456
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,940
to have children technology is moving so
fast we can't come back in

457
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,390
no I'm you know we we were gonna

458
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,029
in an environment where we come up with
the solutions that allow people to work

459
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:05,690
from home

460
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,480
the wire we not creating opportunities
for women to maintain their career

461
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,750
and raise a family. I think that their
there's definitely some room for

462

good

500
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:58,730
in

501
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,529
mime

502
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:06,620
of I'm

503
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,770
did you try targeted recruiting Mike I'm
recruiting on campus with organizations

504
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,260
like

505
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,480
decided Women Engineers good

506
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,480
in

507
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,539
I minded the couple group went that's
one and also the grace hopper institute

508
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,490
is a really really great place

509
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,140
to find qualified women for technology
positions to

510
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,140
and so if you try will target in
recruiting where you're trying to

511
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,480
collect

512
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,130
Road resumes not in the open market but
aimed in specific areas

513
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,890
you might be more successful for my to
increase your success rate in

514
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,539
also we we're pretty good about mean

515
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:57,270
people the career fair will call you
University

516
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:02,049
him return really hard to have a good
representation woman

517
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:05,880
that Imam even if they're not
necessarily developers may be there Q a

518
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,340
engineers or

519
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,929
0 re probably painless no

520
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:16,020
with having a good representation of
women have happened krueger's his cougar

521
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,120
called kirker not this the here

522
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,840
even croupier those convicted be there

523
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,679
her didn't you people in Holguin are
willing to talk and

524
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:30,850
people moon shrinking violet is good

525
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:37,850
one give everybody a chance to break and
right question

526
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,470
I'm of

527
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,279
in

528
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,750
good

529
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,050
in

530
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,470
your

531
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:03,530
of zoo

532
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:07,490
semantic has a very large population
Asian people particularly from the

533
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,430
Indian subcontinent the nation in
general

534
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:13,490
that dozen give this crew diversity I
don't think we're

535
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,020
under-represented in african-american
and another nationalities and cultures

536
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,300
races to

537
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,460
the problem I think and it gets to the
economics

538
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,090
that higher education is expensive and
minorities are economically

539
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,090
disadvantaged

540
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:31,080
and and so the food we can recruit from
is much smaller

541
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,000
the answer is kinda we were discussing
long game

542
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,060
how can we get more kids for minority
kids more

543
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:42,290
girls engaged in STEM education and

544
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:46,020
increase the pool by them when yeah I
centre-half

545
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,590
known for a lot of their or I'm
capability

546
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,710
and I actually you the women

547
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,180
and a lot more role and Hiral

548
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,160
I in particular manage team in India

549
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,380
and bikini good

550
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,440
we have one man six women on

551
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,510
and be manager ID in

552
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,890
a female we also have keen

553
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:18,160
a Czech Republic in South America and
both teams are also predominantly

554
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,730
or not predominantly but at least more
equal between men and women

555
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,670
good I get a little bit split based on

556
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,110
you know what role these individuals are
having

557
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,270
I'm and what capacity the company

558
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:40,270
is growing good

559
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,640
0

560
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,190
in

561
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:52,710
in

562
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,879
walk well given I think

563
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:59,889
I'm I think about our local happier in
the Twin Cities

564
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:04,480
on you know it I'm usually one of the
only women that are there

565
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,260
would be really need to think you could
have some representation

566
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,440
even in the different chapters on at
high school

567
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,589
krueger's at the stem organizations

568
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:20,010
being really really feel that the key to
getting

569
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,700
better numbers home you know on the
employment and

570
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,149
things is to work on your numbers on on
the group in 20 min

571
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,490
and I don't think or has don't have much
in the way our

572
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:36,429
interacting with high school mom

573
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:40,240
summer program you know what I mean %um
camps

574
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,280
rule one be

575
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,879
you need the Tom activities while not
security specific

576
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,210
it you know headed in that direction

577
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:55,030
and to now would be minded

578
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,950
I'm a Christian

579
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:05,640
good your

580
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,800
your

581
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,420
your

582
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:18,520
your

583
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,640
your

584
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,660
of

585
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,420
good

586
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,280
your

587
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,010
for

588
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:36,550
good

589
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:41,940
your

590
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,940
your

591
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,540
your

592
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,550
good you when I'm first started in
security and we think that I with the

593
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,359
only woman in

594
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:58,150
night PMI for you never gone and I'm and

595
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,200
the team grew I mean it it grew

596
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,410
more men are more women into the field
I'm

597
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:08,369
by I I knew that my butt off to the
leadership in my organization

598
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:11,829
observer that part of that problem with
his room

599
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:17,329
and Jenna changing you pick up with the
activity

600
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:20,470
it doesn't necessarily mean that you
have to

601
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,210
now party and I think that that women

602
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:29,910
need to be mindful that that that it not
enough to walk in and say

603
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,920
you're not allowed to do that anymore
cuz I'm here because inter

604
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,220
that's not really the direction we want
to go when right we can do things and we

605
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,089
can be part of your team and we can be
part of the fun

606
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:43,890
we just don't happen lets you pick
better activity to do together

607
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:48,150
but pick different conversation to have
to get because in every week

608
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:51,700
we all get along in any other
environment I mean

609
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,250
men and women get along historically you
know obviously

610
00:36:55,250 --> 00:37:00,280
go why don't we can't figure out how to
get along in the workplace in

611
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,210
and specifically because we're an IP you
don't have to queue

612
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:09,050
activity better Center anyone group and
I think women needed

613
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:12,329
to kinda in number sec suck it up a
little bit

614
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:15,800
and accepted gonna take a while for the
organization

615
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,690
to recognize that that might not be and
include then

616
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:26,579
cultural on norm right here and there is
some 100 you spoken very strongly about

617
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,290
you know your feelings on

618
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,920
remember coastal town didn't knock on
diffusing

619
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,119
certain situation nor you know who IQ
and

620
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,359
I mean kinda directed not hire a man who
did not tell you

621
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,420
my the girl read

622
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,240
3d because nope you we have to be helped
by higher

623
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,099
very you have to be you and

624
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:54,119
not representing women independently
while

625
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:57,119
unit making it harder you know

626
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,520
no I think that the that way to overcome
stereotype in general

627
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,530
it be yeah and you know to carry

628
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,960
wilma and you

629
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,440
keep a high level and you know sometimes
heavy-handed someone in here

630
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,160
Nair whenever thank you thing barry
serafin

631
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,230
would makes it that much harder from a
you know be

632
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,510
CEO decision company down

633
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:26,240
hold you now too high the United

634
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,800
knobs to one word respect I just think
that it some

635
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,730
it it took mutual respect you can you
can

636
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:38,260
expect to be treated fairly home

637
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,810
I don't think it's fair to give me men
or women

638
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:45,890
holing up because of their gender and

639
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:51,030
you earn respect of your peers in so
behave in a way that you wanna be

640
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:55,310
treated three donors min him so respect
that

641
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:02,310
between Christian 100

642
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:10,310
in

643
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:18,030
good

644
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:24,080
in

645
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,730
in

646
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:33,450
ok

647
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:38,359
good

648
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:41,369
in sure

649
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:44,449
no I think we're in a good we're gonna
replay

650
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:49,299
in that respect because our homes are
filled with digital native

651
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:52,869
my children I have world when that can
work their way around

652
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:56,859
technology I'm as well as I can and I
work in the field so

653
00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:00,199
technology more comfortable naturally
the children because

654
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:04,109
it par pop culture no am Urban
Outfitters with

655
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:07,170
5 ran but you know they're their

656
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,799
anti Brandon where deliberately making
that to put

657
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:13,819
the technology using pop culture

658
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:18,609
out there engaging with our consumers
across all platforms no

659
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:22,799
within you know on me can a marketing
perspective we're grabbing that people

660
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:24,829
in drawing them into the technology
field

661
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:29,430
through the pop culture and I think
being able to identify

662
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:33,430
that and that that this new generation
of consumer

663
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:37,229
her new generation professional years
already

664
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:40,769
technology badly they already are
technology professional

665
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:44,779
we just need to adopt the way we operate
runner organization

666
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:49,150
to embrace the way that they work and
embracing the way that they were

667
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,180
in the way the youth the technology will
help but bring them

668
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:57,539
into our field moving forward in finding
the transition

669
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:02,109
I'm no like 00 hacking cool now in

670
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:05,239
you know it live online in the media and
green I'm

671
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:09,749
seen how more widespread people talk
about and

672
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:13,420
David up like that all the time go that
I think is

673
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,650
marine awry /img /url coming in see

674
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:20,759
an ample name with 35 now impunity it
could pick a happy

675
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:24,459
rented out to catch up and they never
gonna catch up he'll be like

676
00:41:24,459 --> 00:41:29,249
a quarter and industry in 30 that's what
I for you

677
00:41:29,249 --> 00:41:33,910
and the Big Bang Theory in

678
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:37,160
I highly recommended 23 female lead in
the show

679
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,489
are sciences scientists and

680
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:43,699
very strong in their own right and and I

681
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:46,769
kinda seen the effective pop culture and
other field

682
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:52,449
and other genres where it's made a
difference in how society accepts or

683
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:53,289
expect

684
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:58,619
behavior to concur so I'm I'm a big fan
of The Big Bang Theory both for the

685
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:01,209
humor site but I think I've worked with
all those people who for

686
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:05,309
also for the social change that is
engendering

687
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:08,569
and so yeah I am saying that is also a
negative side to it

688
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:12,489
to know acknowledge Kelly here Kelly got
me to watch this a documentary film

689
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:13,999
called misrepresentation

690
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:17,239
and it's about how women are
intentionally objectified

691
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:20,890
in mass media occurred or better watch
it was kinda

692
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:24,449
fascinating and informing it not
everything it is a surprise but there's

693
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:26,259
some things in there that really make
you think

694
00:42:26,259 --> 00:42:30,779
so pop culture can be both a positive
and a negative influence

695
00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:34,769
and so the door for all of us is to
absorb

696
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:39,019
the positive side and rejected a good

697
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:42,249
to jump in i almost take the exact
opposite

698
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:45,329
approach on if not that women

699
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:49,249
don't the you know hacking is cool and
big veiny

700
00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:52,749
there are two great you know but they're
still office be

701
00:42:52,749 --> 00:42:56,789
the movie where tacky scene and eat guy

702
00:42:56,789 --> 00:43:00,319
industry that sexy girls don't wanna be
apart

703
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:04,869
like you know I'm too cool to be in
technology

704
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:08,049
because even know there are cool women
there

705
00:43:08,049 --> 00:43:11,890

acceptable and you know everyone should

710
00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:29,759
want to aspire to it not

711
00:43:29,759 --> 00:43:33,069
female male

712
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,630

722
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,229
I mean you get into that leadership

723
00:44:11,229 --> 00:44:14,569
