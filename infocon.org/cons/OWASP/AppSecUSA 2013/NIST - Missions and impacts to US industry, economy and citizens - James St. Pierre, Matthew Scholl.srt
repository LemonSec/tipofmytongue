1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,509
okay great thank you well thank you for
coming

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:07,910
arm noble give you something interesting

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,590
I'm what I want to do is talk briefly

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,679
about the activities and computer
security division

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,880
and also some other broader activities
and yes that apply to computer security

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,900
and then something that's more in-depth
a

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,099
we were asked to talkin in detail about
one

8
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:28,659
interesting project so I hope that
you'll find this project interesting

9
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:31,880
and yes I I will try to keep the
bureaucracy et cetera

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,370
to a minimum okay so everybody out there
who have a Miss mission statement this

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:36,960
is our

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,440
mission statement but the the key point
about yes

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,600
is that this was established to do
research in the area

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,620
I love measurement and testing so I

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,820
is existed for over 100 years I'm

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,350
and has been involved and I metrology
which is assigned to measurement for all

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,160
that time

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,690
probably the best-known so the consumer
level thing

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,960
is the atomic clocks that missus

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,009
has been known for for many years the
research that's involved

21
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:11,420
and defining standards and measurement
accurately

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,270
I is the balkan what goes on yes we also
have

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,609
as you well know anyone who's involved
with computer security

24
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:21,899
has probably come across the St some
point so

25
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:25,530
we also have a role computer security

26
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,759
these are just some examples of the kind
of thing that goes on

27
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,850
on we've been involved in computer
security for your child at least forty

28
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:35,859
years I would say

29
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:39,240
going back to the data encryption
standard which was the

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,209
the original publicly available
encryption standard that made a big

31
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:44,920
difference in the marketplace

32
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,509
now this is an example above the the way
that crypto standards are done

33
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,310
I in this case it was and

34
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,740
it was request put out from the rest and
responded to by I DM

35
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,579
we follow that up later with the
Advanced Encryption Standard which

36
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,439
I'm many be may be familiar with was
developed through a competition

37
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,849
and crypto differs from around the world

38
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,210
summitted their algorithms they were
subjected to analysis by all the other

39
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,080
crypto differs

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,350
and now that emerged a publicly
available open source

41
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,710
strong encryption standard so that's
been

42
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,940
quite a success some of the other things
a we won't go through all of them

43
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,970
I'll be there is also baby I secure hash
family

44
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,240
on role-based access control something
and that i've been involved in

45
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,790
are but I do wanna call your attention
to the quantum cryptography research at

46
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,340
the bottom

47
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,090
that is an interesting field I notice
there too

48
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,830
lines there one wanna crypto the other
is quite unrealistic crypto

49
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,000
and the first one a for improved our
research into distribution

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,110
that's a good example love the Springs
this brings to

51
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,670
this field because as I mentioned we
have a very very strong

52
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,120
physics lab I'm for Nobel laureates et
cetera

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,120
who have done I'm huge amount to work

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,270
and 1 I'm physics and

55
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,300
the key problem in quantum crypto is

56
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,310
to be able to do single photon
production it

57
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,310
all conditions are right and everything
works ideally

58
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,190
important crypto really can give you an
unbreakable screen but

59
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,550
I that is an ideal and there

60
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,300
yeah it was an awful lot that's needed
in terms of practical implementation

61
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,720
so than this physics lab works jointly
with

62
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,570
some our people it itll to develop

63
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,990
strong I'm gonna crypto using single
photon production and also detection

64
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,910
now the next one quite unrealistic
crypto that's really interesting because

65
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,600
you probably read that if there is a
quantum computer developed

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,830
at some point then a lot

67
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,100
the Creek property that out there
basically all the public key

68
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,750
crypto I could be subject to attack
because

69
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,200
there are well-known algorithms for

70
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,050
doing factoring online up on a computer
and

71
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,790
much faster time and making it practical
to defeat

72
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,639
some the asymmetric cryptography so that
an effort to continue this in crypto

73
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,840
is looking at ways to get around that
problem so take the assumption that

74
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,540
there is a quantum computer tomorrow

75
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,710
what do we do to prevent no

76
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,120
the problems that would occur as a
result to that okay

77
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,920
a are here some the bureaucratic stuff
by different groups

78
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,320
a number member involved in research but
as you'll see there's also

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,240
one involved outreach I and there's also
some standards and measurement

80
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,740
the last group there I'm medical
attention to this case

81
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,120
this deals with somebody I
crystallography testing so

82
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,180
if you have cryptography module then

83
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,770
you can now bring it inhabited tested
according to

84
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,180
particular standard its 140 i-20 I think
at this point

85
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,340
so that group that's just an example of
the kind of thing

86
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:10,520
that that goes on focus areas are just
about everything at some point

87
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,950
on at the bottom is again that the
validation

88
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,610
and testing security properties that's
that's really key point

89
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,300
in addition to the cryptographic module
testing there's also

90
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,000
on work on protocol testing

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,080
ipv6 10 sweet and so on I also some

92
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,419
a lot of research that it deals with
protocols the border gateway protocol

93
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:34,740
this is

94
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,320
a big big problem or it's a potential
big problem because

95
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,760
its it needs an awful lot of work in
terms of security

96
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,880
luckily nobody are very few people have
done much to exploit the

97
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,240
the problems amid weaknesses there but

98
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,190
there's an awful lot of work going on to
try to strengthen that at this point

99
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,040
and just about everything else though
they did you can imagine is

100
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,970
addressed at some point out delivery
mechanisms that this refers to how we

101
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,380
I get the the workout tech transfer is a
really big

102
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,110
I important issue yes we do a lot over
research

103
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,740
and that network does get out on

104
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,300
through variety means and gets into
commercial products

105
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,330
couple other things that are going on
now I've mentioned the border gateway

106
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,650
protocol work

107
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,720
others also an effort right now I'm

108
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,040
an attribute-based access control and
missus

109
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,400
a joint work with some other government
agencies looking at

110
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,699
ways to improve access control for
systems which

111
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,780
as you might imagine that is perennial
problem and you to work

112
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,080
right now everything else there

113
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,730
we do just about anything I'm not the
journal and conference publications

114
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:54,350
standards that something on that is
important and I want to point out

115
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,800
this is not a regulatory agency we don't

116
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,530
specify mandatory standards we develop
standards primarily through

117
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,290
working with people like ATF IEEE

118
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,650
but also some miss specifications

119
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,510
federal information processing standards
I at this point that's primarily in

120
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,380
crypto

121
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,210
but there are some specifications that
are taken up and used widely such as the

122
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,540
some a continuous monitoring and

123
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,639
vulnerability management protocols that
are out there secure

124
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,669
I'm you access protocols so

125
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,949
there's a lot of work goes on about we
go again

126
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:37,080
not a regulatory agency that something
important to keep in mind

127
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,360
in okay a an awful lot I'm workers on

128
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,680
reaching out to people we have there is
a new National Cyber Security Centre of

129
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,490
Excellence program that is

130
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,400
then started which is somewhat not
independent and yes but it is located

131
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,360
in a separate facility they make an
effort that there's I'm

132
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,509
cybersecurity education program a
program that has been established now

133
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:05,229
and we have people go out try to talk to
you industry especially small businesses

134
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:09,960
state/local government what they can do
to improve their security

135
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,750
okay I'm not even getting go through
this I think you have the slide

136
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,889
just about anything you can do that you
can fire there would be happy to talk

137
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:19,699
about

138
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,080
on that there's there's an awful lot
that on

139
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,430
we won't go through that right now okay

140
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,800
the key point here this is the kind of
thing that happens all the time

141
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,500
we have lots and lots a congressional
mandates

142
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,919
so whenever something happens that and

143
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,270
raises a concern with congress is very
common

144
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,330
that they will asking us to do something
about it

145
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,980
there's a big this program and voting

146
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,410
that has been going on for for some time
security for voting machines

147
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,820
there's there's an awful lot else that
goes on

148
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,220
a key point here is that congress

149
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,300
typically asking this to get involved in
a lot of these things and this is what

150
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,200
leads to some other standards

151
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,550
that we mentioned earlier the office of
management and budget guidelines

152
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,700
that significant some other things that
come

153
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,320
out of our specifications are taken up
by

154
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,510
OMB and period

155
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,560
basically tell the agencies to operate
according to the standards so

156
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,620
so that is a a case where I missed
influences what the agencies do

157
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,680
which then can have an impact on the

158
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:41,399
the field in general and on the
commercial marketplace

159
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,890
and these are some more examples on

160
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,690
really interesting ones they're smart
grid there's there's an awful lot of

161
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,260
activity in that area there's a new

162
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,120
300 something page security documents

163
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,420
that is addressing security for smart
grid

164
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,450
and that is very very new

165
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,080
cybersecurity in education I mention
that as well

166
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,300
on and then cloud computing that that

167
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,420
a big big area we have two people
involved in that as well

168
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,270
okay now I mention up front we were
going to talk about

169
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,370
in-depth the project that is helpful in

170
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,899
saving money and in this case it testing

171
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:27,310
or security or for general soccer
testing

172
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,040
that thats imported just a reminder

173
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,410
as to what we are why we're doing this
where government agency 9 regulatory

174
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,430
and our mission is to support industry
with better measurement

175
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,680
untested now this project

176
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,190
we've had going for several years now

177
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,470
and it has been very successful will put
up some empirical

178
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,820
data show that in just a minute we have
a tutorial on how

179
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,510
to do this particular type attesting
that are going to talk about

180
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,010
26,000 some people and download it so we
knew someone out there using it

181
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,410
but we also have several hundred
organizations

182
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,600
they're using it these are at the bottom
are not be

183
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,990
organizations that are are just using
these are people we have done

184
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,750
you're at work in joint publications
with so tremendous amount of interest

185
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,560
specially in the aerospace field

186
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,660
as you can see on the right

187
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,560
so as I mentioned better testing is
needed

188
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,880
we know how to do over strong testing

189
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,740
for in response to know him with not
necessarily security but we know how to

190
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,630
do

191
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,399
over reliable software the problem is
that much too expensive

192
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,610
so one of the things that we need to do
is reduce the cost

193
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,209
testing for software functionality in
general

194
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:50,480
but it also important that there's an
awful lot

195
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,589
exploitable vulnerabilities probably
have

196
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,450
that result from just mistakes in code

197
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,870
this is at the bottom a graph a motor
abilities and the number I'm own

198
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,050
abilities reported

199
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,490
in the national vulnerability database
which miss maintain

200
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,410
this covers motor abilities publicly
reported

201
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,570
nearly all of them there are few very
small products that don't make it in

202
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,990
there just because they're not

203
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,060
I'm used very widely by just about all
the liabilities that are publicly

204
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,860
reported her in this database

205
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,060
so the bottom we have a list of the
kinds of problems

206
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,740
that are reported bumper air a memory
management problems

207
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,560
memory leaks and so on you put all that
together and the motor abilities

208
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,500
a bed and beyond

209
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,500
not just older buildings but can be
problems for software and general

210
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,050
account for about half so thats a why

211
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,230
we can get some security bang for the
buck by doing general software testing

212
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,330
if we remove

213
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,500
these basic ears up front that reduces
the vulnerabilities that find their way

214
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,680
out into the field and we also have

215
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,589
and specialized approaches to testing
for

216
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:05,620
security problems including buffer
overflows

217
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,660
and network problems

218
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,620
so where to put this up right up front
this is why the rest the stock is worth

219
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,830
listening to

220
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,240
on Lockheed Martin did two and a half
years study

221
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,420
looking at 8 different pilot project

222
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,589
and concluded basically that

223
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:28,839
this approach saves roughly 20 percent
very poor supply pilot project

224
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,540
but roughly 20 percent I'll test
development cost

225
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,360
and so that's very significant as you
know testing

226
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,630
covers probably about half of the
costumers software development efforts

227
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,149
some cases much more than half the cost
so up to the development effort

228
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:48,680
so they also improve test coverage

229
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,990
I measured in different ways a by

230
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,420
20 to 50 percent so that's pretty
significant

231
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,120
here's an even more interesting when
this is Rockwell Collins

232
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,480
and they looked at how to do in the CDC
castings modify condition this issue

233
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,420
coverage

234
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,720
is a testing used required by FAA

235
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,740
for 10 a software which means

236
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,050
basically software that can read to an
aircraft crash

237
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,050
so serious like critical software it's
extremely expensive

238
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:23,279
I you know that the test the cost
involved is is enormous

239
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,410
so what they were able to do was so that
you can use this approach

240
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,890
to reduce because drastically so

241
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:36,610
some numbers here 47,000 has cases this
was for about a 60 yd line

242
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,180
the zip code module with in

243
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,670
that 196,000 software defined radio

244
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,430
package so and of water test but it was
able to be done

245
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,560
very quickly and inexpensively that's
the key point

246
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,019
so as to how we got to this point well

247
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,209
about him little over 10 years ago

248
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:02,050
we had project that was looking at what
causes failures

249
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,380
in systems so what we wanted to look at
ways

250
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,660
you know number possible causes logic
errors that can be calculation errors

251
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,910
and so on

252
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,740
we reviewed 15 years an FDA medical
device

253
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:20,019
data medical device recall data and look
at what causes the problems

254
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:24,899
and one of the things that struck out
was what we call interaction fall

255
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,510
now what we have right here the nurses
interaction Paul

256
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,660
for example we have a failure that
occurs it the

257
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,279
pressure is less than 10 per some device
saying if you think I'm

258
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,420
and the volume is greater than 100 so
two separate factors are involved

259
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,860
in that failure and at the bottom is an
example

260
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,250
so we had a failure when the altitude
was that 10 years

261
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,329
and the total flow was less than 2.2
liters per minute so there's

262
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:57,250
example two separate factors that are
involved

263
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,990
now here's examples from the National
vulnerability database

264
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,100
so in blue at the top we have a single

265
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,060
what we call a one-way interaction this
single factor involved in the failure

266
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,000
in this case your typical problem
somebody didn't allocate enough memory

267
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,910
to read

268
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,459
the data into but the second what line
is

269
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,230
two-way interaction that's more
complicated we had a failure that

270
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,209
occurred

271
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,990
when there is a single character search
string and a single character re

272
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,510
replacement screen if you had a test
that had one of those conditions

273
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,980
through but not both then affect us to
pass

274
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,070
you would not to take that problem so
this was an error that was out there

275
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,740
I and sort of working because maybe
testing never exercised that particular

276
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,519
case

277
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,570
minute bottom we've got an even more
complex problem we've got three factors

278
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,410
involved

279
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:51,079
so this particular problem would not
manifest itself

280
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:55,470
and again these are buffer overflow
errors so these are complex interactions

281
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,980
that can and you know basically bring
down your system

282
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,040
so serious stuff three-way interaction
at the bottom

283
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,770
so these three factors had to be true in
order

284
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:11,449
for that Mon ability to occur so

285
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:16,110
here's an example what this might look
like in code two factors

286
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,500
imagine the 1i mentioned before altitude
adjustment 20

287
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,699
volume is less than two point2 so

288
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:26,339
if they'll 220 we do something and we
come along

289
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:30,150
and we and the next condition evaluates
true

290
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,919
as well as multi-coated so if we have a
test

291
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,380
that includes for example altitude 0

292
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,280
and volume 1 or any number that's less
than 2.2

293
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,470
then we would trigger this problem here

294
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,960
however if we had a test that had only
one in this condition through

295
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,230
then we would not necessarily detect
that problem

296
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,600
so this is how the interaction faults
are distributed

297
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,620
in the FDA data that we looked at so

298
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,070
in this case up the y-axis

299
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,090
is percentage also detected so roughly
two-thirds were

300
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:12,780
triggered by a single factor and better
than 95 percent by 2030 is

301
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,679
and we didn't see anything that involves
more than four factors

302
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,740
so this is kind of interesting because
these medical devices

303
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,850
most in these maybe not all been but
posted and

304
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,260
could be like critical so that's the
distribution there's

305
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,380
for that application domain some little
data this week data that goes back to

306
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,480
the eighties in some cases

307
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,799
but we look at some more demands so
these

308
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:42,950
this is the ball distribution for server

309
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,590
open source module now the school to a
lot harder to trigger

310
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,740
than the ones and the medical devices

311
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,750
which is sort of disturbing because
servers presumably not like critical

312
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,850
but in this case little over forty
percent

313
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,080
were triggered by a single factor and
about 70 percent

314
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,309
by two factors: and going up we have

315
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:09,830
some cases where they were six factors
involved so that's a very complex there

316
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,030
where you've got to have

317
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,580
6 things through in order to trigger
failure

318
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,000
but as you can see the herders very
rapidly services

319
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,250
he was appalled on tailing off at

320
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,710
and interaction level 6 looked at a
browser

321
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,910
same sort of pattern that we see their
in this case

322
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,570
you were bolts were manifested at

323
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:38,250
one-way interaction less than 30 percent
but a little higher level

324
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,419
I it the level about two-way
interactions

325
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:44,590
but again that the shape of the curve is
quite similar

326
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,929
yours database software in this case

327
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:51,160
this was development software sodalite
blue line

328
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,370
is different then the browser and server
because those

329
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,400
and also different than the FDA data the
others

330
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,910
represented fielded products light blue
line represents

331
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,070
development testing so these tests may
be the result you know very first time

332
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,669
testing the software so that's why whose
fault it probably

333
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:13,630
easier were easier to detect then the
others

334
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,900
here's another one on this case we look
at seated there so

335
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,780
before we looked at it errors that are
recorded in the field but we wanted to

336
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,330
consider the cases where errors are
seated services

337
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,460
a very common package developed by
scenes research

338
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,970
and use an awful lot in testing
evaluations so the ideas you've got

339
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,429
itself

340
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:38,760
software contains no errors you use your
testing method on it

341
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,789
and try to I determined you you're able

342
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:45,890
to detect all those balls and in this
case we didn't see anything that

343
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,650
required a test more than five way
interactions

344
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,679
that's consistent with what we saw you
know

345
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,360
the real-world products in this case
though

346
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,400
if you look at the the location of the
line to suggest that

347
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,470
the researchers worked a little too hard
in

348
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,380
making their stated also the Cedar Falls
were actually harder to detect

349
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,350
because one is further to the right then
the ones

350
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,390
that were in the real-world products

351
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,760
and last but not least network security
software

352
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,840
someone else a not our group did this

353
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,929
good the curves similar again

354
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:26,309
and we have five way interactions at the
top so we didn't see any interactions

355
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:28,360
that involve more than five factors

356
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,760
for this particular set of software the
curve is very similar

357
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,520
I'll go left and less than 20 percent
were triggered by single failure

358
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,030
now likely explanation is on of love
this results in how many users there are

359
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,770
so

360
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,890
browser on the server that work software
and literally millions abusers

361
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,120
whereas the others did

362
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,929
so sum it all up number factors involved
in failures is very small

363
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:59,200
and that means weekend test five-way
interactions or six way interactions

364
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,890
with very few test and the way we do
that is with you algorithms

365
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,280
but this is basically just summing up
business knowledge what we do about it

366
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,179
so me direction rule we say that most

367
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,539
failures are triggered by one or two
factors interacting

368
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:19,900
and progressively you were by three or
more factors

369
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,380
and we haven't seen anything yet and
that no one has reported to us

370
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,700
%uh failure in the field that involve
more than six factors interacting

371
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,230
so what do we do about that how does
that help

372
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,710
well this is how it helps it we know
that

373
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,110
let's say we've got experience with a
particular type of product

374
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,160
and we've never seen a failure in this
paper product that involve more than

375
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,640
four factors

376
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,620
so that means that we do all four way
combinations

377
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,750
then we don't have to do fully exhausted
testing all possible combinations

378
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,890
we do all four we combinations or maybe
more of my way combinations

379
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,679
and we have a very strong probability of
detecting the polls

380
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,059
now there is not a guarantee because
there are timing issues

381
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,200
there on our lots of other issues that
are involved

382
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,650
and you also have to do the same kind of
thing you have to do with any testing

383
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,650
which is some form categoric
partitioning where you've got

384
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,660
input variables that have a large

385
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,870
power is as you know 32 to 64 range

386
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,120
we've got a select points in that space
that matter

387
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,250
you have to do that but if you do that
model right then

388
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,690
are you can get very strong testing so
again

389
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,169
if we can do hall 456 way combination

390
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:37,679
and we have very good testing and
empirical data backs that up

391
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,100
so how this works in practice here is an
example: everybody's familiar with

392
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,400
thinking these is

393
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,530
and binary variables honor of

394
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,250
so how many tests would we need well if
we did

395
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,590
all possible combinations we need to
obviously

396
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:56,120
1000 test that's probably too much for
word processing

397
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,440
program but we could look at all
three-way interactions

398
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,840
so how many first we need to cover all
three way

399
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,950
interactions well we know that

400
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,860
there variable we've got at least

401
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,659
3 interactions protest so that's that's
something we could start with but there

402
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:16,820
there's more

403
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,650
other number combinations we need is is
actually 960

404
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,020
we can pack a lot I love variables are a
lot of

405
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,400
combinations into a single line so

406
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,220
the body wanna get how many tests we
would need to cover all three way

407
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,419
combinations

408
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:37,030
and these 10 binary variables any
guesses

409
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,870
I I tend to put this to and graduate
school

410
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:45,000
classes and undergraduates and you re
somebody'll come up with an answer the

411
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,600
answer is usually something

412
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,880
on the order of a few hundred know the
answers 13

413
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,120
so we can test all three way
combinations with 13

414
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,130
to so that's that's very powerful

415
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,840
on in this case is rogue represent a
test each column

416
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,610
represents one those and binary
variables

417
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:08,059
now this is what's known as a cover your
way and particular type a matrix

418
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:11,030
the theory behind it was developed in
the nineteen nineties but it's really

419
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,320
simple to understand

420
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,919
the key property is that any three
columns picked in any order in this case

421
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:18,340
3

422
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,500
three-way on contains all possible
three-way combinations

423
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,549
ok those values that we can we got my
neary values

424
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:31,830
a possibility is a course so if you look
in it any three columns picked in any

425
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,260
order

426
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,370
left to right right to left inside out
will have

427
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,450
0000 0101 at center

428
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,679
they're all there make their were there

429
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:47,400
so it's very hard problem mathematically
but there are good algorithms and

430
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,330
the project is developed some these
there's a bigger example

431
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:55,520
in this case we got thirty-four switches
so let's say we have some

432
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,640
this panel and we've got some software
behind this analyst supposed to

433
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,650
interpret the way this which is worse
that

434
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,200
and do things differently depending on
what combination that switches

435
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,270
set so at

436
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:12,419
22 34 or about $17 billion combinations

437
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,390
and we can't possibly afford $17 billion
to so

438
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,909
again we're going to use what we know
based on the russian rule

439
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:24,400
that the number of factors involved in
failure is a small

440
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,850
so we could look at testing three-way
four-way five-way six-way combinations

441
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:34,740
for this that really need 33 test to
test all three way combinations

442
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,380
eighty-five per four way I didn't put
the five and six way combinations up

443
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,000
there

444
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,679
but there on the order of a few hundred
by six hundred or so

445
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,539
so the key point is again we can use a
very small number

446
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:51,690
yes to get very strong testing

447
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:55,330
so what we might do let's say we wanted
to

448
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,799
test four-way combinations we can use 85
test

449
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,669
going back to our graph I love the way
failures occur in the way that

450
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:04,220
distributed

451
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,309
we see something on the order that
ninety

452
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:11,130
percent-plus fault detection we can't
guarantee that

453
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,230
that's based on empirical data there is
no theory that can

454
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,159
you know show if we'd easy to come up
with a counterexample

455
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,580
that that would disprove this but

456
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,659
up for the real world empirical data
says

457
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:29,220
that we're going to get better than 90
percent

458
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,470
fault detection again it's not

459
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:39,039
theory but it is in Kirkcaldy based on
houses daily reports

460
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,169
here's an example looking as simulation
that we think that's a really

461
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:44,909
interesting area

462
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:48,179
we have network simulator the idea here
is

463
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:51,440
you have a network and you can configure
disagreed

464
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,570
computer network in Figure two different
ways in some cases you can find

465
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,700
you can meet a deadline because the way
you configure network

466
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,020
number nudes the number but hers but
resigned

467
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,440
so on so we look had different ways of
approaching that one is

468
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,200
simulation where you look at it you know
typical Monte Carlo simulation

469
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,919
but then we looked at improving that
using the comet Oriel

470
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:18,120
purge with covering arrays and

471
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,580
what we found was that we would get much
better detection

472
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,429
deadlocked so in this case 14 deadlocks
how to earn the Normans number possible

473
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:28,600
combinations

474
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,789
right the coming true

475
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:35,600
primary approaches at the top the bottom
is basically

476
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,370
your typical random testing random
simulation that's done

477
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:42,549
and and random simulation you were able
to find

478
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:46,240
a lot of problems but nowhere near as
many with the same number

479
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,390
test so again we can use your toes

480
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:53,169
to detect problems that could occur in
this network

481
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:57,169
now if you're concerned about sending
your network up

482
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:01,049
accidentally such that it leads to a
deadlock you probably don't have too

483
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:02,380
much to worry about

484
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,390
as you can see something on the order
four times and

485
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:10,279
-7 probability ok by me when you're out
having one of those combinations

486
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:14,190
configurations occur by itself

487
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,900
but if you're concerned about forcing
somebody's network

488
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,260
into a deadlock or someone else

489
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,210
forcing your network into a deadlock you
got much more to worry about

490
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,480
because in that case somebody's out
there looking for

491
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,179
so you need to find it was deadlocked
configurations before somebody else does

492
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:37,600
here's an example that we did for the
Air Force they they have

493
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,720
an interesting problem where they've got

494
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,789
their laptop like this one this is not
that theirs is up

495
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:48,679
up in that but this is the basic problem
structure their laptop

496
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,400
it has a lot I'm early exotic
peripherals gardening equipment

497
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,179
UAB all sorts of things and what they
found is that

498
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:59,390
I in some cases in testing the software
in the past

499
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,400
plugging the rituals and and

500
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,400
the wrong order or the way that the
developers didn't expect

501
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,909
leads to a problem so they say can we
use the same approach

502
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:12,510
to reduce the number of test needed to
detect

503
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,309
problems and waiting these peripherals
and

504
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:21,929
it's basically an order this problem and
so yes we did do that

505
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:26,460
I in this case what say we had six it
answers 6 purples deployed in

506
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:32,039
at 720 possible test but with only 10
test we can cover all three way

507
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:32,940
sequences

508
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,120
such that there's an interleaving among
news events so

509
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,220
the key problem is whether that a occurs
before

510
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,470
be occurs before see weakened you take
that very small number

511
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,940
test for example in the matrix if we
look at

512
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,140
anything and the and then followed by

513
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,480
year or more guns and ammo 10 more than

514
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,140
and be we can find that row six

515
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:04,630
and any three-way combination we can
find his matrix

516
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,710
some tools that are available the

517
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:12,070
me and cool is the cover your a
generator and we'll go into more detail

518
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,510
on that and at that

519
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,340
that's the tool that generates the
matrix that I put up earlier

520
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,409
for example with with that word
processing example so that'll generate

521
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:23,360
up to six way combinations

522
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,490
very efficiently no play some numbers on
their

523
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,690
the sequence covering we talked about
that

524
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,399
coverage measurement this is really
important because if you want to use

525
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,080
this approach

526
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,380
it's good it's effective but your
organization probably doesn't wanted

527
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,220
turnover and disrupt all the development
testing practices

528
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,100
just to bring in this new approach
because it may not be fitting for your

529
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,510
organization or what

530
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:50,779
but and your re-establish approaches
that you don't want

531
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:54,059
want to disrupt so we can do with this
measurement tool

532
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:58,140
as we can take those test measure the
coverage that they provide

533
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,520
and then and additional test to

534
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,539
give users a four-way coverage
combinations

535
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:08,470
five-way cover just six way whatever is
needed

536
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:13,029
and then some more specific tools access
control policy tester

537
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:16,700
replies this approach and so on

538
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,820
now I mention that the algorithms and
are much better now

539
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,419
this is a hard problem this is an
example

540
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,940
on so here there is a problem on that
has

541
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,340
to in variables want to test the

542
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,799
problem with 10 variables in this
configuration at the bottom

543
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,470
7 binary to three-way 3 value

544
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:43,159
variables and so on reply way
combination

545
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:46,289
the oval red oval circles

546
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:49,559
the number of test that was produced by
our algorithm

547
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:54,669
4200 elsewhere in this case your test is
better you want your test the cover the

548
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:55,890
same level

549
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:00,529
so 4200 and some terrorist were used in
eighteen seconds

550
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:04,529
another 20 that was out there ran for
more than a day

551
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:08,789
and produce anything because it is
running out of time

552
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:12,630
so the others again they're they're all
quite a bit

553
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,299
and larger test sets and what aristide

554
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:20,809
so missus a significant improvement over
the state-of-the-art before

555
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:24,120
know there are lotsa good algorithms out
there now this this was one of the first

556
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,830
one

557
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:28,760
microsoft has a protocol picked which is
it's free it's a research tool available

558
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,149
you can download it

559
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:33,220
it generates covering arrays as well on
and

560
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,830
works very nicely so I'm not going any
products and I'm

561
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,039
try to convention the value of this
particular testing method

562
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,370
my you can use it using under Tools

563
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,630
here example how this particular to work

564
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:51,440
we would define Center variables and
their possible

565
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,740
values and that's what's shown on the
right hand side

566
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,260
the panel and left in size where we've
defined

567
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,640
it steps you through it makes it easy to
define but

568
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:07,120
we have at the top for a variable called
current vertical separator

569
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,979
three possible values and 11 more

570
00:34:10,979 --> 00:34:14,950
so you can see how this works is fairly
easy to set up set up your variable

571
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,139
and possible values in

572
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,309
this is really important in this is one
characteristic that makes

573
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:25,579
are tools significantly better than
most-wanted

574
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:28,999
else is out there is the ability to
support constrains

575
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:34,239
a constraint example I your typical
example is what say we were have an app

576
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:34,839
that we

577
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:38,309
wanna be able to run on Linux or

578
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:41,899
Windows environment and maybe some
others as well but

579
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:46,629
we want to test that I'm now we want to
set up configurations for the different

580
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:47,639
environments

581
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,089
we're never going to see Internet
Explorer running

582
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,799
online a Linux system so we've got to
generate

583
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:58,809
to us the cover 345 way combinations

584
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:02,219
that do not include any test specifies

585
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:05,890
Internet Explorer running on a Linux
system because if we did

586
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:10,239
to us we can only be wasted we'd also
user

587
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,549
we would lose the combinations for other
variables within that s

588
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:18,229
we've got to be able to eliminate those
so we have a very good support for

589
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:19,229
constraints

590
00:35:19,229 --> 00:35:23,890
to written prevent that from happening

591
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:27,209
we can also do variable strength
interactions

592
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:30,209
so let's say we've got and

593
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:33,869
three-way coverage that we want to do
for

594
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:36,869
large data variables but there's a
subset we want to do

595
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:40,479
458 combinations and we can do that we
can

596
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:44,289
say cover everything to at least two or
three or four way level

597
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:47,880
what's worked out a small subset should
be covered

598
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,569
and I to a stronger level and so were
able to do that as well

599
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:56,499
this is what the output looks like each
row is a test

600
00:35:56,499 --> 00:36:00,039
each column years %uh yea variable

601
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:03,809
and those are the values

602
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:06,979
we have an awful lot I'm users very
strong

603
00:36:06,979 --> 00:36:11,180
and well I T course no surprise but
defense and aerospace

604
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,739
and also finance so that that was kind
of interesting and I actually know more

605
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:18,940
about what the difference people are
doing I know what the Air Force is doing

606
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,650
with it what weapons are testing

607
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,839
I don't know anything about the finance
guys are doing that good

608
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,519
they really like this so that's kind of
interesting

609
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:33,479
telecom also Telecom is another case
we've got very complex software

610
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:38,890
and a lot of money righted more options
for the outputted

611
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,089
on we can put everything out is as a
matrix

612
00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:46,219
that good for post-processing with shell
scripts and so on

613
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:49,279
we can do human readable configurations
but

614
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:52,680
that's the kind of thing where you might
do when I mentioned before with

615
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,119
setting up a test configuration where
we've got 1x

616
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,289
when does Apple and Android and so on

617
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:06,109
so we can set up these configurations to
make more human-readable

618
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:09,859
and contact information we have a
website with lotsa

619
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:13,349
conference journal papers report
confirmed

620
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:16,999
presentations basically just about
anything

621
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:21,440
and feel free to contact us we want to
talk about this as I said got a lot of

622
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,599
people that are using

623
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:26,319
and empirical data suggest that it's
useful so

624
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:29,719
we're always interested in working with
people we learn a lot more by working

625
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:31,180
with people when we do

626
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,739
is trying to come up with your own room
for example the Air Force

627
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:38,339
problem that we talked about earlier and
the coverage for a great coverage

628
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,709
measurement problem as well that was
done

629
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:44,499
we did a coverage measurement some nasa
spacecraft software

630
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:47,589
i'm looking at you know was the coverage
good

631
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:51,059
because this was after all stay software

632
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:55,420
very strong testing several thousand us
so they said well maybe it covers all

633
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,380
two or three way combinations

634
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,549
and so we measure that we we'd actually
developed a measurement tool

635
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:04,049
in that case United to do that
measurement turned it into a

636
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:08,099
part of the package so again just an
example love

637
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,880
the kind of thing that we find useful
and working with people I and we would

638
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,440
love to work with anyone

639
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,009
so any questions

640
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:21,520
in

641
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,210
good in some cases yes in some cases
notice

642
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:33,210
like E

643
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,090
good

644
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,520
you

645
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,690
okay for large set a very well the %uh
the question is you know can we generate

646
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,930
tests for

647
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:54,030
a large set of variables answer is yes
the interesting thing here is that

648
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:58,530
the number of test that's produced is
proportional to

649
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,390
to two factors: beresford proportional
to the number values

650
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:06,240
raised to the power TVT way interaction
so

651
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,800
to 34 way combinations and the logarithm

652
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,250
on the number variables so that's a nice
property

653
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:17,510
because if we have 50 variables and we
want to be able to test a hundred

654
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,100
variables

655
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,210
because it doesn't have that many more
tabs the

656
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,240
the critical point where was the number

657
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,110
values for a variable so you need to
minimize that but you need to do that

658
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,140
for any sort of testing we need to do

659
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,360
some sorta category partitioning so

660
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,670
so yes we can handle large numbers the
various we've had

661
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,900
warned user that's done 358 period

662
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,670
no problem and it works good

663
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,040
that airspace spacecraft software again

664
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:56,040
any others

665
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:06,990
okay or great thank you in
