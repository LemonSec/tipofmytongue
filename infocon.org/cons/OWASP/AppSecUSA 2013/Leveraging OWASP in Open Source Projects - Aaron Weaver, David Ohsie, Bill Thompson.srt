1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,810
okay with you going thank you for coming

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,030
monies Bill Thompson and doctor but I am
practice

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,950
a company called Yukon I'm the builder
home with me

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,130
is Dave ashey from EMC he is a defender

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,110
and Aaron Weaver from Pearson and he is
the breaker

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,130
and we've got a call presentation for
you today

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:31,130
about how we've applied lost resources
to an open source project called casten

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,730
from here who here has them open source
deployed in their enterprise another

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,690
company or works with open source
software

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,289
in okay just about everybody rated I'm

11
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:46,670
how we open source is your is really the
penis to this privacy presentation

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,850
so we're going to talk about somehow we
applied oh I asked to an open source

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,239
project called CAS

14
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,149
this is a web single sign-on system been
around for a long time

15
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,539
simple flexible extensible open source

16
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:04,170
web single sign-on for the enterprise
some it's a it's a great platform it's

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:04,629
got

18
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:09,049
been around for a long time has I'm
auerbach support for Tana

19
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:12,579
applications that you're probably
familiar with and for every three major

20
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:14,490
platform framework language

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,140
and I like to say that there's a cask
wine for everything from ASPD is open

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,380
and it was a initially created at Yale

23
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,840
by Sean Barron 2001 them

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,500
and initially got a lot of deployment
higher education along with some

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,570
a project called you portal which is an
open source portal for higher education

26
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,359
I'm carefully have a Enterprise Portal
about web single sign-on sarcasm really

27
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,750
critical that deployment I was at
Rutgers

28
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,189
in the early 2000s when we had deployed
deported lincoln's

29
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,549
and and original yell CAS and what we're
very happy with it

30
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:53,909
and although the initial casual that
Matt monolithic

31
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,469
and in a potentially everybody every
deployment was essentially a fork up the

32
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:59,770
elk as in so

33
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,009
some at records we had a lot of
experience and enjoyed working in a

34
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:05,429
community aspect

35
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:08,670
really want to be havin a dynamic like
that around

36
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,680
has been so we bacall frenzy yeah we
went up there and tell them what we were

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,350
interested in doing in and some plans
that we had to extend CAS in

38
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,240
in different ways and I thought that was
a good plan and so that that launched a

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,910
project in 2005

40
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,660
to recast catches a community project

41
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,920
under by the JC which is a an Apache
like foundation for higher education

42
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,700
research

43
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,420
open source projects into the price been
around for a long time

44
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,700
i'm too simple protocol Lex Walker
texture as wide deployment

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,930
but it secured what I'm

46
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,790
what we think it is cast fundamentally
is based on curb rose

47
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,940
it had wide deployment been around for a
long time and

48
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,950
we don't know any exploits out there in
awhile how many surreal

49
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,800
reports about it and we have start we
would be a start to see

50
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,940
reports and the community around from

51
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,590
dynamic scans from time to time hey we
see the open redirector

52
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,400
this JavaScript injection or something
newsweek there's been closed

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,580
I'm we got to thinking that you know
maybe we should maybe should really

54
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,200
check

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,550
second-best system is secured and and so

56
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,860
in the beginning at last year and this
year and we

57
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,020
we spun up a what we call the CAS absent
working group and again this is an open

58
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,430
source project so that participants were
source

59
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,220
from the community and the included
corps commanders on the project

60
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,830
employers on the project and and and
thankfully and we were

61
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,740
and gratefully I'm you know absecon for
major security cams

62
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,920
from the players like Aaron I'm so these
are folks have been participating in

63
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,560
basically we've had been having

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,970
biweekly calls and and been doing a lot
of work

65
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,930
figuring out whether or not we could
trust has a secure not good

66
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,180
so these recipes with the goals that we
came up to our charter for the absent

67
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,070
working group

68
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,280
from you want to proactively improve the
security Pasha outcast not just wait

69
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,290
around for

70
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,670
Warner building reports are in for
instance and

71
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,610
we want to be able to respond to
potential vulnerabilities to people do

72
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,030
from time to time so hey this is no
longer believe this is working for us

73
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,370
in sum we take a trip to take a look at
that and

74
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,630
unit it produces artifacts to allow
potential adopter to evaluate the

75
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,040
security a cast that we could

76
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,390
answer the question is secure why we
think it is but here we

77
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,530
now we have actually done some work in
here some artifacts you can

78
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,550
proved yourself whether secure and and
then we want to maintain

79
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,070
in create recommendations on on
deployment practices I'm so

80
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,600
this offer may be secured by the fall
but the deployment may not great because

81
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,560
maybe may bad decisions so we want to
have some recommendations about

82
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,740
you how hard the deployment and that's
what we do

83
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,590
up to for the west to last year and

84
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,190
there is going to talk a lot more about
how the suite 100 Austin nap said

85
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,340
you do looking at me and said he wanna
join as kathleen has a group and I said

86
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,030
sure

87
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,720
in with the cool things about it is we
used

88
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,889
you pick as bright and my company and

89
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:13,580
into now being able to be part of an
open source project

90
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,639
and actually contribute the security in
the project is really an awesome so

91
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,639
we are wanting a drought there is that a
United

92
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,980
in if you would like to get back

93
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,150
a year your security guy consider
joining

94
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,400
open source projects so into question is
one open source projects out there

95
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,730
how do we know the security know there's
various vendors out there that are

96
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,900
trying to you

97
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,780
and through to you that you know open
source or just any product has a secure

98
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,490
a secured and ATP more attention being
paid to do anything did

99
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,240
partially Google search to pay for and
improving source good

100
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,670
persecutors snowed in releases we want
to go back and look at the air there any

101
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,020
back doors in the air

102
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,340
what exactly going on I'm but it be
obviously I'm ready security conference

103
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,720
here so we know application securities
imported

104
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,990
so now we need to try to enter a
research project

105
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,190
so I think in some ways and maybe

106
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,440
open source you up to mean obviously
should be open about

107
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,330
the stopper security vulnerabilities at
the at rate

108
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,450
in and work you fix those immediate
those issues

109
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,830
he collected project today need some
that are really doing it really well and

110
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,870
then there's an open source project that

111
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,330
they don't have any sort and application
security working grid

112
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,610
so you know wanted it the questions

113
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,240
that we have added you know when you're
looking at an open source project

114
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,520
at least from my standpoint your
security gate him when he was you know

115
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,150
hey how secure is this project

116
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,190
are they doing source code review

117
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,130
do they do dynamic skins I'm security
architecture

118
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,580
when they actually are we take the
application are they are they looking

119
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,199
printed dick making the correct design
decisions at the beginning because

120
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,800
obviously no building security at the
beginning is where we want to be and

121
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,180
so does that open source project to do
that

122
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,210
and I think it you can position your
product

123
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,970
or your your your project that way that
you do you security

124
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,150
you doing here it is here the artifact
that produced at that

125
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,669
can be a fantastic selling point for
your project

126
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:28,570
but do security really can be a selling
point is no

127
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,240
yeah I do you open source projects in
the past in

128
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,840
quite a number of them it was like every
other day somebody found some flaw in it

129
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,810
and any most people don't want to be
around patching their products all the

130
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,070
time you wanted

131
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,110
there to be a basic security built in so
for example you could

132
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,180
security can to check your project at a
pic onward bread

133
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,210
but you know it is just one example you
know where president let a boner believe

134
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,040
they're very

135
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,530
good about fixing news issues and
intermediate mediating mem

136
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:01,820
but did purse because their popularity
but we don't you don't wanna have

137
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,520
you know your product your open source
project in the news all the time because

138
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,840
it is bro a billionaire

139
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,770
recently night beginning in this year I
think actually maybe with a in June or

140
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,889
July

141
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:16,460
researcher went around and looked at
Moodle he just hit

142
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,100
you know somebody open source projects
that are out there and

143
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,460
he saw that he just been within two
weeks tiny down a boner

144
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,680
a particular vulnerability Anthony when
asked him can you fix this

145
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,860
and it looks like you know for them
decided not to fix the entire even

146
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,329
decided to text a

147
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:35,959
and you can't even the downloads near
this quite a number people that have

148
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:37,559
downloaded this project

149
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,369
and to know your honesty downloaded an
open source project you've adapted

150
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:45,180
your enterprise in his new patch for so

151
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,639
what you gonna do well in some cases may
be going to play when really

152
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,949
you wanna fix it in the project itself
good

153
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:56,980
today brings you to this point you know
i dont and Justin 2013

154
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,619
really attack in israel you're all well
aware this is a particular sticking

155
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:02,149
point for its own people

156
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:06,819
mom is very should this be engineered
bien but I think it's important to you

157
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:12,339
emphasized that but we rely obviously
I'm not two components

158
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,720
and super example has is a is built into
a lot

159
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,160
product out there overlaid or the
authorization platform

160
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,829
and abroad we obviously want to be
secured

161
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:29,509
and so this a9 component think it's very
important for our project because it's

162
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,990
like

163
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,610
pay we can point to think if they here's
what we're doing to remediate those

164
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,290
issues

165
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:39,550
in so just a minute yes and I have that
we've seen in our

166
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,369
in our project you know it you know when
he was probably be

167
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:46,579
here working group meet on a regular
basis

168
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:50,399
I Boii resources have been very valuable
for us

169
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,480
I mean we've used those quite a bit

170
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,809
meet regularly in order to use
technology rate worries either when

171
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:59,689
xscape it really help

172
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:02,699
have to be able to see each other in
person I don't know who to believe it

173
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:05,790
you know if you can see the video the
other person like it and it delivers I'm

174
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,220
at these guys in person

175
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,040
but you know I would be able to identify
who they seen on video 48

176
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,649
and so those anything's really help

177
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:19,009
you make a DVD report on abilities for
example you know he hand

178
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:22,360
you know what I companies now are
pushing hate

179
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,679
you can disclose it to estimate not
gonna practically you for that to make a

180
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,550
DVD if you find a vulnerability

181
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,920
to take those in and then you know

182
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,040
David get out more about this is doing
threat analysis

183
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,800
and I can tell you it's always a little
bit get equipment announces

184
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,149
but David change my opinion on it back
to you know go into that and what they

185
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:42,649
discovered their

186
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:47,300
dominant we are still running different
security tools has agreed that project

187
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,009
and that I know that the project leaders
here

188
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:54,449
I think he really did maybe it is pretty
basic but it's just you know that when

189
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:58,279
and then just doing static analysis as
well

190
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,839
super wanting to or contributors is
beginning to open source project

191
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,339
you know I recommend I guess that use OS
resources

192
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:09,839
threat modeling work with security
researchers a bit if somebody think you

193
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,829
can really don't

194
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:14,879
discarded day hey I think that stupid
and i'm looking cute little bit and

195
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,179
water cannons

196
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:19,189
sure there's a manner that are you
should ignore but

197
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:22,369
lol oftentimes researcher has now it
concerns

198
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:25,399
it you work with that researcher you
know it

199
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,559
you can either him too late good

200
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,290
you noticed full disclosure where you
can say hey let's work at it was put

201
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,910
into the project mistreated by taking
its actually

202
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:39,470
fix that problem so year years as a
speechwriter get

203
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,179
I'm not a farce but just tonight as an
idea that is what the way to do it

204
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:48,249
they haven't had a way for people to
report your vulnerabilities may be easy

205
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,220
if your project and if somebody finds an
issue with the your project

206
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,050
they're able to reported we did you get
it going out as soon as we did a little

207
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:57,739
bit

208
00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:01,329
I did you dynamic announces honest in

209
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:04,559
me said it can always be a little bit
noisy but

210
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,160
I would recommend you know where those
things do you recommend it or you know

211
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,389
recommended Isaiah we recommend doing

212
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:14,119
all those things that you do I am
experienced used at X Games

213
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:17,980
and you know we found a couple issues

214
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,579
and we actually work do those prioritize
them

215
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:25,779
and work through really a ting so it it
very beneficial to do those kinds of

216
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,009
things also help you find your silly
stupid study should text

217
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:36,009
in so now handed over to be able to get
it right

218
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:40,269
thank you aren't billed and good

219
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:44,319
son David OCIE work and UMC corporation

220
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:47,800
and and you see and doesn't want to

221
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,889
and posters of work and Butthead

222
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:54,889
we do leverage open source software and
one other products that we do leveraged

223
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:57,970
in a number of places in the MC in more
than one product in fact I

224
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,239
as I you move around to different group
with EMC I find more more that use that

225
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,800
we do use this and

226
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,420
and for a vindication for and single
sign-on ticketing as a thickening engine

227
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,290
we used

228
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,019
I'm CAS the project we're talking about
here and so I got involved

229
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,949
in hmm and you notice to the user to try
to get involved as a

230
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:21,220
a supporter and and you actually looking
into the code itself and

231
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,410
and changing updating the protocols for
things that are useful to us

232
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,999
so as a result and I went to the
material conference where

233
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:32,610
I'm can as being discussed and because
bill

234
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,879
and good started with this idea will
have a an application security a working

235
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:37,540
group

236
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,980
and one of the nice things about working
at EMC is that

237
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,860
and we have no in part because we own
Thursday

238
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,429
and we have a very a strong and

239
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:52,049
group and that supports application
security at school the product security

240
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:53,009
office

241
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,920
and they have a with a lot resources and

242
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,149
related to and the lottery results
related to doing and

243
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,509
making sure their applications to secure
won the things that

244
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:08,720
wants to assure with the things that got
drilled into my head from that

245
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,819
experience was

246
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:13,379
the notion love doing threat analysis is
part and

247
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:16,600
you know not guaranteeing budzyn opening
up

248
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,769
and whether opening up in finding out
about your application we're

249
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:25,110
the security holes are and

250
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:29,149
I can send it was a joint this project
and I couldn't share

251
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:32,179
the interior sources what I found is the
OL

252
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:36,009
resources around runny noses and other
other taxes and

253
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,259
and application security and

254
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:42,980
advised is are very rich going and Sue

255
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,439
and just by using that utilizing those
resources we were able to

256
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:50,339
to get storerooms project and so the
starting point really is that and when

257
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,009
you ask people as interns and

258
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:56,110
when you have people built you know is
can secure many times but you talk to

259
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,209
commuters those they will go to secure
you know I didn't use any security was

260
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,470
with you know I know

261
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,139
I'm writing I'm writing a code for

262
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,899
authentication engine went well how
could it happen to be that I don't know

263
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,170
that security red

264
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,199
I'm not he was you know I didn't we got
started I don't agree on a new one

265
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:15,759
you know saying oh let's not do this but
I think people were a little skeptical

266
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,429
as to whether we would find anything

267
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:21,509
I'm so and you know I introduce the
notion has been

268
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:25,689
through noses ahead experience from UC
and basically what read emails is it

269
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:26,790
gives you away

270
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,439
to systematically analyzed on the
threats

271
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:33,470
possible threats against your systems a
rather than just saying in sitting in a

272
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,139
room

273
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,079
looking up at the ceiling is an I don't
think there's any threats and I don't

274
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,739
think there's any problems with our
system

275
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:42,209
was what is there a way that we can
actually look at the system

276
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:45,699
systematically going up from going over
from top to bottom to find out

277
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:49,160
is that actually is your assertion is
your intuition correct or is it not

278
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,959
correct

279
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,329
and put the chances are it not
completely correct if you actually look

280
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:54,269
at the system you're gonna find things

281
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:58,119
I'm the other thing that thrown out this
does is to the outlets or the input is

282
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,029
your system in your

283
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,499
your you know trying to analyze it in a
systematic way we'll talk about exactly

284
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:03,589
how that works

285
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:07,339
I'm the outputs or you know possible
threats you have things that could go

286
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:08,759
wrong with your system really

287
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,299
places where your system could be
attacked and then what you had was right

288
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:13,850
you going to do things like you know

289
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,230
in light snow how bad the threat is what
you going to do about mitigating

290
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,829
but you think it's reno's is does is it
actually gives you and help with the

291
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:24,189
adopters are your project can use rates
if you have good

292
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:28,029
a product that's being better than other
products I'm the adopters

293
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:32,429
if they want to when your product and in
a secure way they have to understand

294
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:33,639
something about the way the thing

295
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,389
act your product actually works I'm not
show examples later on about how it

296
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:38,489
works and when you do

297
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:42,239
reynolds's utica decompose the
application way that you can actually

298
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,279
let adopters understand deeply something
about your applications that they can

299
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,189
figure out what

300
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:49,389
if they're doing things right or if
they're actually breaking your

301
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:51,579
application by the way the depleted

302
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:55,779
who his was the methodology

303
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:59,619
so that the dollar's years that
basically and the person you gonna do is

304
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,889
and we're gonna decompose the
application going and

305
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,909
it supports and there's different ways
of doing that mean you can do it there's

306
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:06,579
textile

307
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:10,329
a tax base where is it doing it and you
can hear you can write paragraphs but

308
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,149
each component

309
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:15,100
and and such and the way that on again I
want to be associated

310
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,600
document will was website is to draw
data flow diagram and image shows Anders

311
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,110
and

312
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:24,019
and woman I'm when you when you
decompose replication is good

313
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:27,449
using a data flow diagram what you're
going to see is

314
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,049
you're going to see all the possible
places where I'm data can flow in you

315
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,059
know the system

316
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:34,970
do you think about it from a security
point of view you want to attack a

317
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,299
system you have to attack it

318
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,600
at some attack surface and any attack
services and

319
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,840
input or output points to the to to the
and

320
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,039
the program that you're analyzing so
this is a very good way to find

321
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,360
is a very good way to begins you
systematically find places

322
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,210
where vulnerabilities could exist where
threats do could exist

323
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,909
good what you've identified unique
oppose the application you identified

324
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:00,840
basically

325
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,029
what the attack services or then you
actually want to enumerate through its

326
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:08,350
against the tax service and for that
what you're going to do is rather than

327
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,860
against it are you looking at doing

328
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,029
I'm trying to trying to get what attacks
could be there

329
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,769
you going to use something like a threat
library were some methodologies that

330
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:17,769
gives you

331
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:21,809
a systematic way evaluating the possible
threats against your system

332
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,049
there's a bunch of different ways doing
I'm in this particular case

333
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:28,279
let me show you something called stride
but again if you look at the

334
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,399
hmm if you look at the what they give
you

335
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:35,230
many different a possible methodologies
even used

336
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,679
and then having gotten to enumerate all
those threats and then

337
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,659
I'm sorry man I love to bring him into
it so then now you discovered a threat

338
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:46,169
and you want to rank you know how how
important is that thing

339
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:49,340
I'm and there's a number braking systems
that you can use to and

340
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,850
his arm that's a little more formal so
far less formal

341
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,409
and having rank threatened you identify
the rank them

342
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:59,799
you want a creative I was the
medications me and from that was the

343
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,120
mediation you can do

344
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,510
make and conclusions about what you want
to you with you if you want to do the

345
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,230
project

346
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,880
I'm actually system with animals that
make it work country to all the stuff

347
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,120
that I just talked about

348
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,470
is all know what website there's a
there's a there's a couple pages

349
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,659
and that described threat modeling I
might have a link to one man here you

350
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:20,899
can go just search with remodeling
you'll find there's a couple pages

351
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:23,980
is the overlap between us was we love
them and you can decide

352
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,639
based on that what you read what
methodology actually will be used

353
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,519
okay so what was our experience
basically what we did was

354
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:35,539
we started with a wakeboarding session

355
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:38,399
okay it was actually a if you're a
conference this was really a good thing

356
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:39,510
because

357
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,830
again you tried in was your sister is
really analyze what threats there could

358
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,450
be

359
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,289
there's no one person that fully
understand the system well enough to be

360
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:47,210
able to do that himself

361
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,399
usually him or herself you should going
me this

362
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,289
you know even even if you had a super
expert on it he's got a certain point if

363
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:55,620
you're the system

364
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,500
and for it not to take the simplest
example the colder the system and the

365
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,159
adopted in the system we're going to
have to do for your points

366
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,909
and having or them in a room together is
a useful thing

367
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:09,049
going and so we got started with we got
started with

368
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:13,009
I just what were we drew actually drew
idea for diagrams that the guy came in

369
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:16,990
1 I'd run for my in six period just as a
starting point to demonstrate that we

370
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,889
just got on the way boarded and

371
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:22,440
we produce the initial data flow diagram
and started you know looking at threats

372
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,529
I think it also got people interested I
really got people saying wait a minute

373
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,809
you know this this methodology might
actually do something for us and

374
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:32,659
after that we kinda followed up by
weekly with them with where that is

375
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:35,850
I'm so we again we plan to bring we have
a way toward you know it is

376
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,690
you know for sure I know you were to
what word we the

377
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,750
together with the diagram looks like and
we can actually we have one side we've

378
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,740
got our little

379
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,090
threat methodology we talk about the
management library we say

380
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,059
was attacked you can you imagine that
happening despite the system we

381
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:51,059
enumerate them and it's

382
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,990
it's interesting what you can and what
we can raised on when you got a bunch of

383
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,029
people together on the phone

384
00:20:56,029 --> 00:21:00,929
in on as a measure use tried to help
identify the threat socially with others

385
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:01,789
in a moment

386
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:05,309
and I basically just took the results
and put them up on wiki page again as I

387
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:05,990
mentioned

388
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,580
reported what we want to do with the
wiki page for the what we want to do

389
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,299
with the opener this is due

390
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:13,720
enumerate threat so we can we can find
what we want to do next to the project

391
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,870
to try to mitigate them

392
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,940
but some it is just so that adopters can
be more confident about

393
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,039
the security the system and also what
they have to do to make sure that the

394
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:24,610
system is secure with a devoted

395
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,919
good so okay here's a bit of a mess

396
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,340
so we started off by then and i IIIi
advised people to do this if they're

397
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,419
doing for a moment this is my experience

398
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:39,159
it doesn't sound like a good idea but it
actually is so the first thing you do is

399
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:40,370
you do a context

400
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,679
data flow diagram okay so we just point
out a few

401
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,100
I'm just gonna point out a few I'm
heavenward don't read

402
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,289
not to try to read the the letter in
your cities will have a better diagram

403
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:51,090
in a moment

404
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,269
with more details but just to show you
that the kinda elements on the diagram

405
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:57,230
this diagram actually doesn't have all
the elements a dutiful diagrammed

406
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,149
but this is process I'm the double
circle me to the complex process that

407
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,860
means that

408
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,230
you know cast itself is actually
composed many other problems inside

409
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,960
so if I double click on this not going
to do anything but I double click on it

410
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,789
in the in the in my mind right I'm going
to notice that

411
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,509
inside ok as as many different past
these the double circle indicates a

412
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:18,830
complex process that could be further
decomposed

413
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,009
these other boxes are kinda external
processes that

414
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,080
interact with our system and you can put
up with three the arrows

415
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,559
described it well right data flowing in
into Cano's

416
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,799
going out ok as and then the invitations
on the arrows tell you what time to do

417
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:34,490
that is

418
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,139
I'm and finally you've got you got these
little

419
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:42,049
on boundaries here which are kinda
privilege boundaries were sometimes

420
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:44,240
they're called or sometimes people use
them

421
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,230
as security controls on and what I've
done here

422
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,769
in this is not the entire picture
because trying to put the entire picture

423
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,110
between readable

424
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,309
is we do this context if a diagram were
basically we took

425
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:58,649
we envisioned imagine the the caste
system

426
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:03,299
as one black box rate one complex
process in the center

427
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:07,289
and we basically Cara categorized the
input and help would

428
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:11,179
I'm all inputs and outputs I'm that we
could

429
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:15,039
think I've to that process

430
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,380
you know that process okay no you

431
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,889
you not gonna get a very good
understanding love you were

432
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:27,250
your and application from something like
this: the internal your application

433
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,429
but you're going to take your it's going
to give you a good way it would be your

434
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:33,049
application from the outside is going to
give you a different perspective on the

435
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:33,980
application

436
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,519
and where can be attacked so even though
you know when you look at the first time

437
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,269
it kinda like

438
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:41,389
you know I can it's too much stuff on
the a page ready

439
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:45,330
it actually is I find it is actually
useful to you donated by people that

440
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,389
to start within hmmm

441
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:52,330
what we did and that's what we we
brought we brought things down into a

442
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:52,889
little more

443
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:56,129
a little more country detail so hero go
through a little more I just got a

444
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:58,860
little more details you can see
something that we did so

445
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,580
here's the CAS server okay which is
basically the

446
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,429
singles on it and that's where the the
user logs into he was into that any

447
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:09,620
and use that to and

448
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,429
exchange his credentials could be
credentials to be a you know what I use

449
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:15,279
a password to be a certificate

450
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,820
you could be I'm a ticket from some
other external system it is an AutoCAD

451
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,759
whatever it is something that's going to

452
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,940
authenticate the user media that
kaczynski's exchange it for

453
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,669
a and exchange that were either ticket
brings a greater

454
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:32,210
were were at a greater good as a service
ticket which are used for

455
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,590
further interactions okay so we see
they're supposed to be there it is

456
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,970
loaded in use new password and also the

457
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,289
URL the the applications that and

458
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:45,809
we can put it on his restriction on the
ticket the ticket is only valid for that

459
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:46,759
location

460
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:50,200
um and I we get back this data okay

461
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,149
we have a boundary here it so we've got
from the browser to the CAS server

462
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:58,970
running over HTTPS good we we try to
make sure that happens

463
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,700
on and of course he was gonna you don't
love you passwords for the security

464
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,139
boundary

465
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:08,500
I'm down here and so this is an internal
processes partners

466
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,309
the browser's an external process I
don't really control the browser they

467
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:11,990
put that in

468
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,909
in this is a rectangular box on the
browser also interacts with the

469
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:20,190
Canada agent replying that's it from the
application I don't have all the arrows

470
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,129
are just I'm just

471
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:24,159
this is a partial picture just to
demonstrate that the idea and the

472
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:24,940
technique

473
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,330
I obviously there have to be arrows
between the canceling the application

474
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,559
I just don't have the picture the
picture would you busy

475
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:35,379
but I'm again you can imagine the
browser I'm coming up from

476
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:38,570
you having want to McCanns is going to
bring

477
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,340
to you then has pointed a service to
good

478
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,610
I'm to anyone access to the application
and is going to be making a steep erased

479
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,419
UPS

480
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:50,759
requested this is a problem already can
see a problem reaching alright because

481
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:54,899
if it needs to be request and someone
might be able to do that service to

482
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:55,740
continue the present

483
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,230
me so we already got a potential threat
right there

484
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,759
and it actually came up but we we
thought we discussed in I'm

485
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,269
and then coming out of this you know
agent is is basically

486
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:09,720
and you know some response the request

487
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,929
and session cookie you know which could
have been is that was based on

488
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:16,669
I'm trading in the session to get a
service ticket for person who could be

489
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:20,179
so this is the kinda I'm this is the
kinda manana

490
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:24,240
noses you going to do for data flow
diagram and again if you enumerate every

491
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,549
single arrow in the new

492
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:29,320
menu a new rated every single interface
that could be attacked

493
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,000
hypothetically right if you do a good
job and you can then take everyone was

494
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,679
interfaces and try to figure out

495
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,070
is there a threat where good so the next
10

496
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,200
okay is actually taking some kind of
threat library again

497
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,090
you can do this without you produce an
informal way but it's better to do it a

498
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,559
little worse for wear red

499
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:50,710
so on this is Astrid is kinda general

500
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:54,759
a you know a general threat modeling a
mechanism to try to identify threats

501
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:58,120
they are more specific with threats that
we should be checking for it you're

502
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,230
doing a specific kind about location

503
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,350
like a web application and if you go to
Westwood so you'll find

504
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,250
different methodologies but but but the
the main the commonality is

505
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,820
is there some systematic way Avenue
rating the things to think about

506
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,320
it's not a replacement for thinking it's
not like a template you can adjust

507
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,919
problems your application

508
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,580
and even if I'm with the threats are but
rather than trying to just go in your

509
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,519
hand trying to figure out you trying to
find

510
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,669
a systematic way looking at it so this
is one systematic

511
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:27,970
rendering hood the possible kinda
attacks

512
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,110
they can be done your system so on and
then

513
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,980
what they don't know what you find a
stable yours website with more

514
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,980
better description what he to the
threats or they wouldn't do it looks

515
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,519
like it would have been useful to put
the new

516
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,200
yours with the finest this table and
it'd better

517
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,200
but basically what you gonna do this in
this particular and table is

518
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,360
different kind of threat to you have a
different kinda security patrols

519
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,759
that you need to apply in order to
mitigate the threat

520
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,490
so there's two different ways using this
table right you can kinda look down and

521
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,059
say

522
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,590
alright is there a way that I'm someone
can

523
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,909
and you know so we can tamper user
interface

524
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:08,820
injected intemperate my system such that
108 in my system is

525
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,120
is no longer has integrity anymore I did
and that's one that's when

526
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,409
one kind where you can look at this than
me or a good day

527
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:19,759
you know is there a way that so we can
use this interface to grab information

528
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:22,940
that is not supposed to happen
information disclosure okay and then

529
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,919
the other way to look at it is to say
you know what I mean look at it from the

530
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:26,820
security control

531
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,769
with you you I have what kind of
medication do I have on this important

532
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:35,720
good what kind of method doing you know
for keeping confidentiality data through

533
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,249
the simple

534
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:40,049
red what what makers do have to maintain
availability on this input

535
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:42,549
ready so I can look at it from the
threat when are you looking to look at

536
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:43,970
it from the defense point of view

537
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,240
and again there's other with a is
actually we do it unless I don't

538
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,730
remember the methodology but is actually
methodology that

539
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,220
and reverses this it takes it from the
defender we love you

540
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,999
makes enumerating all the different
kinds of defenses and making sure that I

541
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:56,379
have

542
00:28:56,379 --> 00:28:59,179
every single one other possible defenses
that I would need to secure my

543
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:00,100
application

544
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,389
available at that interface in

545
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:07,169
okay so I put together I had to deploy
diagram that

546
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:10,590
again is one methodology to identify all
the different tack services

547
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,879
I've got the might threaten library so
to speak that

548
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:18,649
you know that I can use to apply to the
the inputs I'm to those attack services

549
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:21,840
okay so what do actually get what it
looks like so here's one that we

550
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,080
we actually did discover through through

551
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,269
you know trend analysis in this
particular case what

552
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:32,499
it was owned we put it here under the
category information disclosure of

553
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:33,419
course

554
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,809
it's a little ambiguous in inorganic a
source it will in the US

555
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,139
if I have information disclosure attack
on education system

556
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:44,080
I'm also inherently kinda susceptible to
smoothly as well right because I can

557
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,389
steal something which is

558
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:49,749
credential related or to get related or
what have you I can use that disproved

559
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:52,999
but in this case we categorized it we
could characterize it as

560
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:56,279
you know information disclosure and but
we instead we

561
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:00,019
we because immediately it was a it was
the

562
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:03,240
it was a and you I'm his

563
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,850
we could we could categorize is good
thing switching attack

564
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:10,470
week addresses information please return
it because that was the immediate

565
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,679
attack vector was to get information
that abuse is not be able to have the

566
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,299
attacker

567
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:17,710
should be able to have to basically what
we found was that there's many

568
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,990
there's a couple places with the system
as you can imagine these tickets that we

569
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,419
hand out to users

570
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:25,039
we don't want people just getting their
hands on made a great if you have a

571
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:25,690
ticket

572
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,720
I get to rate my credentials to I get to
go to CAS it has my credentials to get

573
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,379
back its a good

574
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:36,110
and then I can use that ticket for
military purposes rated

575
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,679
so I don't want I don't know unable to
do so it's pretty obvious

576
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,970
I'm and it turned out that in certain
places in the protocol

577
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,059
I'm it had to do with the the proxy
protocol where

578
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:51,080
I'm a authenticate to be and then be
want to act as a proxy inability to see

579
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,710
on behalf of the day

580
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,159
we have cases like can support said it
turned out that in in

581
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,179
in the is somewhere that protocol there
was a

582
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:02,509
there was a place where be

583
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:06,730
this property was talking to teens and
exchanging information with has

584
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,889
using in a TPD and

585
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:14,740
and where the ticketed identify your

586
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,850
was actually into your eye

587
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:21,080
as a pre Bremen good

588
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,960
no there's no browser don't there's a
there's no shoulders shoulder surfing

589
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,940
a possible in this particular instance
because it's happening machine to

590
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,200
machine but

591
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,419
and that's that's bad practice really
mean if you look in the

592
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:35,470
the HDP spec itself says don't do that
okay

593
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,580
for example any kind any kind a server
I'm

594
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,580
your webserver logging that use for
traffic you know

595
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,240
like anything just because you always
read on to a file which is readable by

596
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,009
people

597
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:49,059
we cannot be you know we're not the
identity of the person was it a good

598
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:52,330
I'm so that's really a bad idea you
could get indexed in

599
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:56,230
you know in in internal search engines
or who knows what on

600
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,299
so this was something that we got to
because we reexamine the problem

601
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:03,350
we want to pay taxes said what kind it
was nice to be done there

602
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,960
would nestle senior otherwise you could
argue well was a bad design decision to

603
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,129
do with a position

604
00:32:08,129 --> 00:32:11,419
but the point is that you can have those
kinds of things in your system

605
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:14,600
you are going to happen and what you
systematically go look for that you're

606
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,119
not going to find in

607
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:20,299
what you someone will find it will be
good good

608
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:23,879
so in this case with the mitigation the
medication is okay well you know don't

609
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:24,470
do you

610
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:28,249
the first medication was you can as does
the one you have it's own

611
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:31,190
made so make sure that we're not walking
these things right make sure that those

612
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,720
printers don't get one

613
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,009
okay that's when the litigation but
really that doesn't fully solve the

614
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:37,899
problem because the web server could

615
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:41,450
done it want to before we had a chance
to even see it so really

616
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:45,460
really and because this really is unique
as political rights really really make

617
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,039
it secure really needs a

618
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,419
a need to put those breweries that again
using it as

619
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:53,960
as a retrievers and again okay so this
is a sample

620
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,259
this is an example the time is right you
can get it was going to Nielsen

621
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:02,869
in our experience in in remediation

622
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:05,919
I think there's two categories
remediation you could there's probably

623
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,070
more but this is easier to use the ones
that

624
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,999
that we I counted I call them you see an
order

625
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:15,909
was the easy ones aren't so easy but you
want to basically

626
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:19,279
security guy related basically things
that you can do

627
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,210
in documentation without actually
changing the system

628
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:27,379
to make sure that you can that the a
user is deploying a system can deploy to

629
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:29,419
secure way to mitigate the threat

630
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:33,820
okay so as an example and I mentioned
before that

631
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,980
you can have services that term are
accessible the

632
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,309
HTTP and using CAS and they can have
tickets being parents and

633
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:44,230
and those tickets to be sold well you
can going to get has and you can say you

634
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,539
know what

635
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:48,179
I can let you do that not going to hand
you a ticket if you're in a shitty p.m.

636
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:50,220
point but he's not going to give you a
decade

637
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,369
on you can do that there's you going to
the can is a configuration and is a

638
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:55,619
wicked

639
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:59,600
and that something that you put in
security good and

640
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,029
something else that happened we actually
at the same conference and

641
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:06,299
somebody was only giving a discussion
about how they'd implemented

642
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:10,490
a CAS agent or plugin declined and where
they discussed how they did it turned

643
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,640
out that they actually

644
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,790
animated a very easy to make mistake in
the implementation of their

645
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:19,940
their accounts but it was a cast member
in node.js made a very simple mistake

646
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,679
and it won't Asian won that bet

647
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,040
I'm is very easy to run two weeks we've
got documented you don't make this

648
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
mistake but it was a good reason to make

649
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,950
I mean they made a mistake and you know
it went over to talk to me afterwards

650
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,280
the olympics bid

651
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,929
on the clearly if that was written down
as security good

652
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:38,620
made very explicit that users one place
to go to make sure that there is a cure

653
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,450
that would have been much worse acted

654
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:44,290
and another example is securing the
registry right to visit the registry

655
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:48,310
right and that the registry is
somebody's database or cash whatever

656
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:52,060
well I don't control that I'm CAS no
control unit code

657
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,350
I have to make sure that my daughter
what he adopt my project right

658
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:59,730
knows that you know if you've got to
stick to register their it's gotten to

659
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,670
racial information in it you have to
know that you have to know that you have

660
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,160
to make sure that you're secure
directory

661
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,060
again that's another thing to get over
security guy that's also something you

662
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,550
know

663
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:11,610
red noses have actually look at my table
diagrams I can see

664
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,330
8 there's a call out to this external
process and control

665
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,990
and if you don't if you was adopted on
secure that good

666
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:22,910
this is not secured and water things
will change

667
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:26,570
you change the code so was the big
things is your secure by the pool

668
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,030
I'm you know on what did you think will
that not that hard to change would

669
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,980
oppose any changes

670
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,390
any change is difficult and introduce
incompatibilities would have you but

671
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:38,280
those secure the borders like I think
one of the things teams that came out

672
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,500
was there was a lot of places where
again you could turn on cam has got it

673
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,690
in secure way

674
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,290
was indicated in security you turn on
and secure way

675
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:51,040
and so that's one one kinda harder
change a change the code as a category

676
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,960
things that

677
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,650
I think a worthwhile to look at a few
different noses and

678
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,910
another thing that we we talked about we
just talked about the registry

679
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,860
what if I said you know what I don't
believe that my customers gonna security

680
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,890
correctly probably

681
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,070
what can I do about that well and
couldn't group written and signed into

682
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,720
the registry

683
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,870
they don't worry about that anymore then
even if the database is wide open

684
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,150
hypothetically it migrants he's a
secured

685
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,420
my system is secure again the time you
get a threat analysis

686
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,690
the you know what is right here I come
with the medications and I C you know

687
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,670
categorize them

688
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,160
in one category the other good

689
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,730
I'm so the result was also we have and

690
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,000
we week gratified and making threats
against the system

691
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,540
I would generate about 10 proposals or
I'm changing

692
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,720
making changes either adding stuff to
the security guy were proving the

693
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,500
security the the project

694
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,330
on one proposal that would secure but it
will propose that we talked to build and

695
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:49,450
basically and disabling uprising by the
pool

696
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:53,060
him is actually integrated into the next
version again so we actually

697
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,680
had some country I'm it was night
artifacts that we

698
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,240
sure that we that we produce that can be
just read online we actually did

699
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,130
actually I'm

700
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,760
get something to code and I to
paraphrase what the customers was you

701
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,650
know basically

702
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:09,040
I start up with you people that I was
growing up in the air well because we're

703
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,850
so you know what I don't think we're
gonna find your own really did bindings

704
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:15,630
so it was but you know was we have some
evidence that we use license

705
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:20,010
on so challenges or what we're getting
here so challenges that we had I'm

706
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,990
UN Security Project like as features get
favored over security

707
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,590
and so people are interested in hey I
want to make sure that I can integrate

708
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,070
into some other sister

709
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,260
you know I can deploy it in and on this
language in that language

710
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,570
and they tend not to look at the things
I've been to you know were written code

711
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,400
it was written by years ago

712
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,080
might have problems with it by the road
looking at the news done difficult to

713
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,140
get good and consistent participation
although

714
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,270
I'm the folks here actually i doing a
pretty good job you will have day jobs

715
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:46,970
but we're

716
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:50,490
taking the time to do it once a week I
think once every two weeks going to work

717
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,590
now if you can even

718
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,970
even getting 12 one to two weeks on on
something like this you actually make a

719
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,140
lot of progress

720
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,300
and think Michael presenters and your
own who was a committer who

721
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,920
who joins us every couple weeks into
pregnancy could come here I'm

722
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,900
you know course me what you do you
recommend changes you gotta get them

723
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,980
into the project it difficult to get
them

724
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,890
and schedule then you gotta put priority
in

725
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,070
looking to get into the end right so
basically and

726
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:20,910
want it and basically the and the call
here was basically to say that

727
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,410
and you we did is basically visibility
remained under the Mysore

728
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:28,080
and I'm not getting paid to do this and
but

729
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,320
by doing this this is a project that we
we depend on

730
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,940
and if you're interested in making sure
that

731
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,200
these kinds of projects in a bit better
security with easy way to do it

732
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,620
find a project lookin go look at it try
to get it

733
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,610
try to get story you know what it is
working to start application security

734
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,970
working group we're just going to
security bugs

735
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,190
in the in the truck he was the group are
so whatever it is that and

736
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,830
you know you feel you can contribute
right i mean is open source projects

737
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,010
they're not going to become

738
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,440
secure magically by themselves nice if
the experts don't

739
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,300
put the effort into do it now would you
know when he's going to might be good

740
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,870
so and thank you very much you can we
can to question

741
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:12,509
should

742
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:15,549
should

743
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:22,549
good

744
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:31,049
good

745
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:45,790
good

746
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,970
wall

747
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,910
and

748
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,069
wall

749
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:02,890
when

750
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:08,450
what

751
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:12,900
a good the question is against the
question is in

752
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,900
it so you he made a couple comments
there the question was

753
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,380
why would I want to draw a dutiful
diagram about all these other

754
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,150
architectural diagrams

755
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,640
we did you know kinda some richer
information and

756
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,680
so I'm not particular

757
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,099
a ballad saying it has to be able to
diagram

758
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:36,109
mean that's the way that I'm Microsoft
and others in the industry that

759
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:39,619
do these things and I think that if you
have

760
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:42,769
too much detail course but also bad
maybe you need to get to the little

761
00:40:42,769 --> 00:40:44,450
traction where you can actually

762
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,499
identified a tax services related so it
may not be important

763
00:40:47,499 --> 00:40:51,170
the exact deployment might or might not
be important to do in this analysis from

764
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:51,660
it

765
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,029
I'm I think the point here is that a lot
of times you don't have

766
00:40:55,029 --> 00:40:58,450
the right diagrams to be able to do the
systematic identification attack

767
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,069
services

768
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:02,559
if you've got another diagram that you
can use to do that my personal thing

769
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:03,690
would be I would take the

770
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,170
other diagrams that are very complicated
and actually reduce the complexity so

771
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,059
that I can do this and knows is properly
treated

772
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:12,499
and I got this thing that that talks
about you know deployment has use case

773
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:13,410
diagrams in

774
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:16,869
100 other things and people internal
components and glasses that is going to

775
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:18,009
distract from

776
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:22,259
this kind of analysis so in my asserting
that you have to redo all your diagrams

777
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:23,230
to get started with those

778
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,099
know if you've already got a diagram on
with you can look at and say you know

779
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:26,880
what

780
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,220
I can take this ride we are one of these
models and apply to them

781
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,920
yet I think that's been tested I do
think though that the level

782
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,309
fraction is the in my experience so far
this is the real

783
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:41,029
tracking you do get to identify where
the attack services will be better than

784
00:41:41,029 --> 00:41:42,720
you would with them diagram that

785
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,450
as a lot of other details that you don't
need so my intuition would be

786
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:49,700
take those other diagrams and simple by
them into something like this and it's

787
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,710
not you know who's but

788
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:57,710
you know obviously which is that you
know good

789
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,890
yes I did

790
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:07,339
good

791
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:08,630
event

792
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,820
good

793
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:17,820
good

794
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,539
good

795
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,170
said

796
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,490
you know

797
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,900
no you will the against you I think he
said

798
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,980
begin with the question was why would
you bother with striated

799
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,700
with the developers use this work were
de tocqueville's is right

800
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:43,700
know but but yet so there good

801
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,400
well I think so that's right character
categorization

802
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,860
I'm is really Michael review it's too
nope

803
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,170
the person that's doing the threaded
awesome me its I know you're

804
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:59,080
who develop he said doesn't help the
developers I don't know who the

805
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,420
developers are you talking about but

806
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,450
the point is that if I don't have some
systematic way

807
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,840
does not destroy to be something else
really another some systematic way of

808
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,560
thinking about all the possible

809
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,340
threats this location I'm going to miss
things right

810
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,870
so this is just the way it he's tried at
a high level way

811
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:19,390
to me I will weigh it looking at did I
remember to look at integrity died

812
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,980
members look at every aspect to the
system

813
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,540
they could every aspect of this I'm
attack surface that could be attacked

814
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,970
you were to figure out whether or not I
miss something obviously

815
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:33,550
wouldn't want your what you're actually
done the analysis the output is going to

816
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,340
be something that looks

817
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,490
something to similar to what about the
board right there made blogging look

818
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,380
like this

819
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,910
so again if it doesn't get this is not
the thing that helps you

820
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,190
and there are much more detailed are
much more detailed and

821
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,530
threat libraries that you can find very
specially for web applications you can

822
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:48,930
but yeah

823
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:55,930
good

824
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:03,099
go good

825
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:10,099
well

826
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:17,110
good

827
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,520
well

828
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:27,520
good

829
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,660
good

830
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,580
good

831
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,810
ok good I think I think those are I
think you know those a more specific

832
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,609
ones that are dealing with the kinds of
interfaces

833
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:51,210
and I I don't disagree I mean I know
this is really the question

834
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:55,210
I did yet no I mean I was I said we have
in your stride

835
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:58,390
the point is you want to do something
systematic 0 you don't want to just

836
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:01,609
you don't want to just start must it
stared at the ceiling to your table

837
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:04,970
trying to figure out what what things
might be relevant you want to

838
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,480
have some list that you're looking at
this is it was that we use but i i agree

839
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,930
with you i mean I'm not thinking

840
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:16,930
whatever list is useful to you good
other questions

841
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:21,880
okay thank you very much ok
