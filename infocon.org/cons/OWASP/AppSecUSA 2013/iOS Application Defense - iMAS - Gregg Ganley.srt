00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,470
thanks everybody for coming my name is
Greg meme

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,510
mobile security researcher at mitre on

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,530
principal investigator working on IMAX I
was mobile application security

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,330
to just give a quick background about
what is

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,990
are minor wear non-profit company work
in the public interest

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,119
we don't manufacture products
essentially

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,849
enabling us to provide conflict
conflict-free guidance

8
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:31,240
we operate several several FF RTC's were
called

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,440
federally funded research development
centers for the DOD the FAA

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,190
the IRS various organizations on

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,790
with inside my two independent research
and development program

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,720
and essentially we're doing look ahead
research for our sponsors

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,630
and I mess comes into this common

14
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:56,120
were in the second year of our research
with them so real quick if I were to get

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,490
in a quick elevator ride with you

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,270
I would say that I masses I with
application defense

17
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,869
an expanding that a little bit where
secure open source application framework

18
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:06,649
to reduce

19
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:11,219
application vulnerabilities information
loss let me give you a little bit a

20
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:12,140
background on

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,609
Iowa security on in general you could
say that it has four layers

22
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:19,859
the device data network and application
layers

23
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:23,590
com inside by our security

24
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,060
in Sydney the security violence itself
the election in a really good job

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,259
com Oreo the over the years it it has
gotten better

26
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:36,249
but just looking at Tom the the OS
itself

27
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:39,719
the actually have a pretty they've
reduced the tax services much as

28
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,170
possible not having jar Java flash

29
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,469
the strip down a lot of their system
aP's on as compared to the same aP's

30
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:48,119
running on full-blown Mac OS

31
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,149
OSX com is a smaller footprint in that
mean

32
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:55,520
if one did get root access onto the
device

33
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,810
there's no shareholders there's no
command in the shell to manipulate

34
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:04,049
on like Android when you get into to a
rooted when your rooted android device

35
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,389
you have all the

36
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:10,910
a fingerprint fingertips on is also very
sad be the code signing basically

37
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,070
pages in memory and all that stuff they
do a lot to to make security

38
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,870
much more hand right on a box

39
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,420
their model definitely is comprehensive
and it has evolved recently Iowa 6

40
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,280
I am was created on tips 14-2 compliance

41
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,840
approved governing use this means that a
more more government

42
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,070
ABC's likely going to be building custom
maps

43
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,450
now that they have the steps approval
that one %uh the wickets they need to

44
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,120
get through

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,000
in order to field these which also means
is more need

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,520
for IO s application security in a
particular I miss

47
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,050
to justice go where our research is
coming from

48
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,640
on you know the eye with a tax services
multifaceted

49
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,020
the threat vectors can be anything from
a loss stolen device where one can have

50
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,000
physical access

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,210
on this malware that can be inserted
perhaps

52
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,710
by the browser JavaScript engine and
then more recently was being

53
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:11,560
enterprise app some as a vector and
that's because essentially

54
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,000
developers who are building I was abt
for enterprise are

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,230
sometimes grabbing code of the web on

56
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,520
from the open source community some love
it is not well vetted and perhaps

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,940
has some our inside that another way to
from our to get onto these devices

58
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,960
and if you look at an attacker's purpose
they're they're looking to steal

59
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,300
application data fide

60
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,300
enterprise credentials use drop in the
video microphone phone calls

61
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,290
and then the other scariest while one is
the communicant role

62
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,320
Enrique onto kinda get back into the
enterprise network essentially use it as

63
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,590
a

64
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,380
a foothold to get back into your
enterprise so far I met were focusing on

65
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:47,940
om

66
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,670
the application usage data as a target
and that

67
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,700
enterprise data tactical operational
data if the military would feel these in

68
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,810
into

69
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,660
in these devices given to soldiers we
want to try to protect that data

70
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,780
and finally in a patient health
information is another aspect that we're

71
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,470
looking to

72
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,390
to help lockdown we want to forget
protect against

73
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,050
malware and physical access attacks
really thats securing with that

74
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,709
static and dynamic application controls
is the focus Lima

75
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,209
you look at Dom packing in jailbreaking
in Iowa

76
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,969
nom it actor well-documented Tom John
jackie's book on the left

77
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:30,860
from are all Riley and you know they
still be Miller

78
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,719
in a bunch other folks there there's a
buncha well well-documented ways to get

79
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:35,409
into

80
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,499
into the ie2 into I went into
applications

81
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:41,849
the talk rate before me was a great talk
the talk stay there when it to the

82
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:42,639
specific so

83
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,110
how easy it is to on you know reverse it
and then do your message was willing in

84
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,569
all that

85
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,969
on is is there's there are job rakes

86
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:54,860
haven't heard a job Rex Ryan 7 just yet
that isn't everyone's

87
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,580
when I was 6i when they came out there
was really prominent ones

88
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,509
ovation and then you know what the
device is jailbroken Tom

89
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:06,580
do today so we put this light up back a
couple years ago a black cat

90
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,810
wear specially if you have a four-digit
passcode numeric

91
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,979
on one key and you know put a
brute-force

92
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,810
program on the IRS jailbroken device
when a real quickly

93
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,110
and within a at max you know he and
iPhone 4 he found it to the 80 minutes

94
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,930
to crack a

95
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,199
a passcode and get longer and longer as
you pass codes get

96
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,960
more complex but on with a large
majority folks not

97
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,050
having passcode even if they do they're
only four digits

98
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,080
its a real simple way to get around
their cause one ship the passcode

99
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,279
you now have the key to unlock the
device unlock data protection on the

100
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,409
device which now gives access to

101
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,930
the data around these applications

102
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,199
so you know kinda summarizing that
together on the field a standard I with

103
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,900
that today this vulnerability

104
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,810
that being the four-digit passcode I
just talked about that and then you look

105
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,139
at the very system component can watch
when you're in

106
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,520
how one can if the device is jailbroken
than ever to access

107
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,909
the the the memory itself the debugger
the waiting

108
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:09,330
get ahold above your device and then
your application itself

109
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,090
on in a course you are a user
authentication application access

110
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,189
if you don't build the city raffia using
the OS

111
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:19,990
which really there's not much available
for you to do that on so that an area

112
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,610
where

113
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,749
one could expand on and then finally
keychain flash

114
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:28,669
data stored in 20 overs passcode you can
access the keychain and you can access

115
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:33,400
the flash data storage so is and the

116
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,009
you look a little ability to summon
numerous and

117
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,009
so here's here's what we're trying to do
with the I'm a secure application

118
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:42,009
framework lot on the slide but

119
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,400
officially were we're looking at
providing

120
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,249
on somewhat of an application container
it's not a build on the fly

121
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:53,009
on single library kinda thing it's a
series of bomb

122
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:57,089
individual security controls that
developers Cena

123
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:00,969
download and use from get up because
we're open source

124
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:04,949
mom we're basically taking the security
controls beyond apple i OS

125
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:08,830
were trying to reduce that Iowa's ap
attack surface nominees are vetted

126
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,960
prioritizing

127
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,939
security control to not talk about that
on in like I said it's open source

128
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:18,719
you were trying to grow that open source
community com the takeaway here is that

129
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:22,059
we have whole bunch different role than
a talk about on

130
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:26,219
and as as this at this research here
goes on when to keep adding

131
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:30,249
into if into more those controls and
I'll talk about means is very

132
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,849
security areas

133
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:38,240
so you look at Tom where I'm asks if in
the application stack this

134
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,529
this is a graphic was taken right out of
the arm

135
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:45,710
security document that was published by
Apple and if you look on

136
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,129
essentially the the stack in Apple was
fairly closed off

137
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:54,830
on like Android is many different ways
are you gonna lookin at you security or

138
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,400
or add to embellish

139
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,279
security I'm with with IOUs you pretty
much

140
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,009
the area has to be within the
application level and that we fit

141
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:08,689
rate up in the apt in box

142
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,800
not a few years ago my to put together a
report for the

143
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,610
the primary defense CIO and in basically
went into

144
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,469
arm describing all the various mobile
threats that are out this man did a

145
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:21,259
pretty good job categorizing

146
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:25,650
on the various mobile threats their from
their software based their web-based

147
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,860
network-based com this physical based
threat

148
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,869
enterprise in the course user base if
you look at all these

149
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:35,329
Tom I'm a pickled applicable to what
happened the

150
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:38,949
about 12 or so on which is pretty good

151
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:42,289
I mean if some that are network basin
we're going we're focusing on the

152
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,209
application itself

153
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:49,360
if you speaking a loss on the OS mobile
top 10

154
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,050
we cover six to the on the mobile top 10
in secure data storage

155
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,829
up for authentication opposition
medication

156
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:01,880
broken cryptography on security
decisions in an instant information

157
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,029
disclosure

158
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:09,230
so we're trying to cover as many as
possible as well

159
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,290
with some if you look at I met what
we're trying to do in

160
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,329
we have a graph here the talks with a
number of security controls unless

161
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:18,850
so Mike my claim is that the more
security controls you

162
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,920
and to your application the

163
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,660
more secure on your app becomes and the
spectrum can go from consumer to

164
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,339
enterprise

165
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:31,759
to when I'm calling it a price plus and
then you get into the classified space

166
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,870
so on the yellow box is kinda where
we're at with Iowa

167
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,899
6 today on that that

168
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,779
that first black dot there live you
animal mobile device management system

169
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:43,940
way

170
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,320
a manager or unit and then you had
perhaps a nap container we

171
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,649
her those last talk with his good as
mcconnell is a couple of their

172
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:53,959
now you can add additional security
control to bring you

173
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,480
closer and closer but at the last talked
just talked about there are a lot of

174
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,610
ways to get around the Zap containers

175
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,329
com and so I'm saying if you want to

176
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:07,699
if you want to make the you know
officially increase the security your

177
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:08,940
application

178
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,639
take a look at IMAX and take a look at
the controls we have in by adding them

179
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,519
to your apt

180
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,420
we're gonna raise enough to the point
that you can get closest to the

181
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:16,959
enterprise

182
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,779
cost plus level and have a much a higher
level love assurance

183
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,949
we have a look at Iowa 7 just yet on
it's on the folks have developed and I

184
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:27,160
was before

185
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,420
out there Iowa 7 itself mom it is what
you have to do to change or you tall

186
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,269
sets

187
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:36,540
a bread your your OS X actress or going
to get there we have got their shit

188
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,930
IMEI with developers are here today
agree

189
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,759
we'll take a look at the security
controls on just gonna bounce around

190
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,509
starting the top left the device access
so

191
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:52,519
I talked about the four-digit passcode
we have a security control call passcode

192
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,500
check

193
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,709
com and I'll talk about that in a moment
but essentially allows

194
00:10:56,709 --> 00:11:00,310
the allows a developer to com

195
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,620
a I'm to confirm that there is a
four-digit passcode or even a complex

196
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,509
passcode on the device

197
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:10,019
application access on I was the doesn't
provide any

198
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,300
anyway to essentially put a password to
your often have to build it yourself

199
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,459
this is a control where developer could
quickly an app

200
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:20,240
password to the app the rest the
keychain in core data

201
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,680
on were are vulnerable areas into we
have a control column cryptic or data

202
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,190
on secure foundation which is
essentially an open SSL

203
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,190
port on dialer and I were also looking
at Dom

204
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,490
Indian remote control runtime: remedy
bugger jailbreak root access we have a a

205
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,250
security check

206
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,910
control one could add on tickets into
jailbreaking and debug debug attachment

207
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,800
detection

208
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,100
on we have a memory security control and
they were researching

209
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,779
encrypt ramdisk this year at pampering

210
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,790
we have this notion about forced
inlining so as folks know arm

211
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,110
inlining functions is a good thing and
so we have a security control the talks

212
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,500
about that as well

213
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,740
on and several others were doing
research

214
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,170
enter the data in transit thats somewhat
out of scope that is out of scope for

215
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:09,930
I'm at

216
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,399
but we we I looked around and actually
found agree

217
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,110
get her repository SSL conservatory
these folks have a um

218
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,990
a really nice kinda tutorial way to do
SSL cert pinning

219
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,240
on and that at least one step closer to
having them

220
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,019
a more secure network connection

221
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:33,120
you talking about each one in particular
on

222
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,800
to study with the Pasco check this is a
program at library in a method to

223
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,350
enforce

224
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,110
device called pass could use essentially
on i OS there is

225
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,329
there isn't a library that the developer
to call it says

226
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:48,040
has the user set the passcode if so is
it is afforded

227
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,470
tended is a complex market because I
you'd like to be able to use you know

228
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,540
have your app cheats behavior basin that

229
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,560
decision so anyways we provide this on

230
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,990
know if the tutorial it's also a a
security control that one can

231
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,589
you know compiling and follow along on
the research that took a little while

232
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:06,959
the kinda piece it all together

233
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,589
what was out there but it's actually
pretty interesting

234
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:15,040
yet password self on we have a secure
simple use a resettable password to

235
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,930
protect

236
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,519
com and essentially if you go out and
look for our passwords

237
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,339
up and get home or other open source
areas there are some out there

238
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:27,629
but if you look in the background if
they're mostly a user interface because

239
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:28,170
in the back

240
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,519
there the usually just go to you know a
class method that there's

241
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,290
they're saying the past where they can
leave the whole story to the password

242
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,339
on up to the developer we actually get
into the behind the scenes were

243
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:44,529
were crippling a properly and not story
on the device

244
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:48,670
and we you were using open SSL we're not
using data protection

245
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,110
or on the I O S

246
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,430
keep them keychain so that a great way
to look at a cryptic or data is one

247
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,259
where

248
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:00,379
on if you would record a today if yes
you can

249
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:03,600
you can actually select the lake the
data stored in a flat file

250
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,800
are you likely to restore the database
that databases sequel late

251
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,449
com the people at library that compiled
into core data

252
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,839
just stores it in plain text com so if
one

253
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,550
has a passcode get into the device they
can find these people I files

254
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,910
in easily pull them back to their
laptops and peruse look through all the

255
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,529
data

256
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:26,269
what we've done is we've actually on
we've actually

257
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:29,819
create our own Core Data API that
similar to coordinator

258
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:33,060
and we've compiled in hickel cipher

259
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,829
which is an open-source way to compile a
shame that goes about people like

260
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:41,189
so that particular control is going a
lot of traction

261
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:45,410
out and out on the and get up and it's
one that people find

262
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,060
you somewhat easy to use and we're
getting percent to get more the

263
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,600
community to develop

264
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,040
security check is a simple way to to
jailbreak in debugger detection and we

265
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,879
have a lot of

266
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,670
it a forensic techniques in there you
can see macros

267
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,870
on name was function blocks in line
method

268
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,680
on that's something that folks find
useful

269
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,639
secure foundation we've taken open SSL
crypto and Wii bundle that made it easy

270
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,649
for developers to grab make use up

271
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,199
we've also grab the 50 version ovett to
compile that

272
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:24,009
so love this is is is the use cases Tom

273
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:27,350
security requirements commission on your
application

274
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,360
and the developer is asked to do the you
meet these requirements

275
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,569
the developer someone left on figure
this out

276
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:38,680
in develop on the fly here and we're
hoping they can kinda

277
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,670
come to our site come to get up take a
look at the particular controls

278
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,470
and in see how the how these controls
done and then

279
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,079
incorporate them more easily

280
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,329
I wonder if from this this laptop has

281
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,439
internet access no as

282
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,949
okay so I was gonna clicking can assure
you with the site looks like but we'll

283
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:01,800
do that later

284
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,990
so memory security here's one where if
you have a on

285
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,399
a if you're sensitive information so
much thing store password in here but

286
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,629
it's the idea that

287
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:15,139
the region is also a place where com you
know the friend's ex folks or

288
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:18,269
a bad actor connects take a snapshot of
your am

289
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:22,279
your app and then they can peruse it you
strings whatever to find sensitive

290
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:22,949
information

291
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:26,230
like what's a patient health information
with your nap that

292
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,899
stored your patient health mission will
you leave social security number

293
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,790
on you critical medical records you have
it stored in

294
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,350
using critique or data inside over
people like file that incredible you

295
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,139
pull up a display to the user

296
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:43,050
that time it in transit or in memory
perhaps you want to store some attention

297
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:43,889
information

298
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:46,990
in cryptid so that the only time its on

299
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,999
in the in the in the clear is that the
stack level verses that the heap level

300
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:54,040
on so that makes it harder for that
snapshot to take place

301
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,470
so here's on this will be a challenge
because 0 arc

302
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:02,579
on objective-c in kinda the way it
manages memory what not so

303
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:08,339
anyways the really interesting it a
camper technique

304
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,140
14 lining on is recent one we just had a
fair few weeks ago

305
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,650
in the idea is that you in line in code
from me

306
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,390
you know someone uva a code reuse
perspective is not a good thing right

307
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,659
you don't make

308
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:25,970
the whole point of compilers to try to
make your

309
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,809
XQ bill is concise as possible but in
lining is actually great way from a

310
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:31,059
security perspective

311
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,320
to kinda place information in multiple

312
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,320
in multiple places throughout the code
without into actually

313
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,250
truly duplicated and so we have a make
sure the tutorial and

314
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,419
some techniques up there how to do it
with objective-c com

315
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:47,830
and again this is challenging because
there's a there's a lot to do with that

316
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,320
that one has to do on this is several

317
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,549
optimization settings won't have to
figure out so on

318
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:58,240
we have all the stuff on I get home to
see on our on the drill down to that in

319
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,850
a minute

320
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,640
another slider to end

321
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,279
available today and get have all the
different roles on we have a

322
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:09,690
even up there a password Pasco check

323
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,690
that mister and then we also have taken
a look at

324
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,120
re male and it's an application that
Google purchase a few years ago its

325
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,710
open-source

326
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,799
I'll talk more about that in a minute
com we also have

327
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,340
some reason and the animal control
research stuff that we're working on now

328
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,320
is we're wrapping up our secure MDM
remote control research

329
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,490
where i'm looking in the cryptic code
models com

330
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,140
net the idea that if you have an app for
that is saddam

331
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,590
on the device and its acceptable to

332
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,929
a bad actor if they have all the right
that

333
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,490
that you could take the F hold on to
their the laptop

334
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,409
and run IDA Pro on this and reverse the
app back to see code

335
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:52,830
then take a look at all your all your
algorithm and figure out what you doing

336
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,049
so we do with encrypted code models is
is we would like the developer to

337
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:58,090
identify

338
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,460
on critical areas of code anyone that

339
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,270
does why you security work and actually
accomplish that into a

340
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,520
a dynamic library and then we'll encrypt
the dynamic library

341
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,679
on so that when the app is now at rest

342
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,929
on not run not being run on

343
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:19,909
is they could be portions of it that a
justice who crafted blob

344
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,159
so if a bad actor grab the code pulled
back to their

345
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,809
they're on their laptop ran out a pro on
it data the decompile the fact that

346
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:29,140
increase even to the

347
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,870
the way the UI's want when they want to
look at particular security areas

348
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,789
they would be there would be in cricket
on and so the question is is you know

349
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:40,159
I research is gonna look into how much
is the app can we encrypt

350
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,890
com know obviously the time we talk
dynamic libraries risky it

351
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,770
go up on the App Store again our focus
is really that enterprise customer

352
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,370
on that is building the zaps for their
their particular business

353
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:58,080
com and they're using you know solutions
where they have custom app stores

354
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,210
so in the future we want to look it i
cryptogram this kinda bomb

355
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,279
having a way in memory to store
sensitive information

356
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,760
kinda thats transient on dynamic ap
underling

357
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,880
fancy way to say you know basically take
I'm ass

358
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,529
wonder what is a container and try to
added on the fly

359
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:19,620
on like some commercial products but
this will be an open source solution

360
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,669
someone could

361
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,990
you know enjoy and look at all the
details of how it's done

362
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,510
and do your own solution if you like not
device trust you like to experiment with

363
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:33,750
the Lightning connector and perhaps you
the whole notion we've seen folks

364
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,679
and of folks have been a black hat this
last summer but they had a a

365
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,919
a great talk where these folks actually
connected the

366
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,789
the USB charger to an iPad exploited the
USB

367
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:48,799
interface and in all kinds of stuff

368
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,909
like actually taking a nap pulling it
back to their

369
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:55,610
their little remote chance their little
charger and

370
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,940
rap basically wrap the Facebook app in
this little Trojan happen and put it all

371
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,020
back so when you rent Facebook first

372
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,039
thereafter rand which was recording of
keystrokes that you would

373
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,700
typing and then paper popped up to the
user was was intercepted

374
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,970
you know the knows nothing at all
anyways we can look into different ways

375
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,120
to how the Howard from a nap perspective
one can make you so that interface

376
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,409
if possible would look at some models
and

377
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:24,059
technical details what we're doing with
security check so on

378
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,159
for the jailbreak in debug attack
detection we're doing two interesting

379
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:27,770
things

380
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,960
most done most the books they describe
before com

381
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,039
they actually talk about the you know
officially takes control

382
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,090
and you know make it make a call it is
controlling have it checked to see if

383
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,600
the process flag has been set to be
viable

384
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,890
on that typically can be found by the
forensics

385
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,370
slew that's looking through code here we
actually

386
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,190
week we go down under the covers were
making actually directed assembly called

387
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,590
below that to read the process flag and
so I that's a lot harder to find

388
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,830
you can you imagine if you take that
function in Houston you in line at

389
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,669
many different places all over the code
and all the sudden you have this check

390
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:06,809
that in the past the review no

391
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:10,390
a friend X person could just look for
you know your check

392
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,399
and then what you doing like maybe
you're exiting whatever and then just

393
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,480
no out the exit call here on you know

394
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,870
be much harder to find rather than
bundling that in a lightweight french

395
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,470
mature read that party app

396
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,679
and an hour so you have these checks
that are running when

397
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:28,620
users do things but then in the back
room where the thread can also be

398
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,890
running jailbreak and debug detection so
it gonna make said

399
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,480
I mean obviously the goal of security is
they'll never get to the 100 percent but

400
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,470
what we're trying to do was slow the
attacker

401
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,029
make them work harder on so that
eventually they can get caught with a

402
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:46,980
frustrated one

403
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,750
so 14 lining from looking for this is a
recent security control we put up

404
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,750
on github in Dom and so the notion we
sing on the left this is a normal

405
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,130
execution will you have

406
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,549
on you have a check function on

407
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:04,640
and then you run from sensitive code to
check in again you're into more sexy

408
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,500
defensive code check it again

409
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,990
in with the compiler around it's really
just gonna make a call back to this

410
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,370
to the single-copy on and in other words
the compilers gonna

411
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:18,820
optimize all I optimize out all those
different functions into this one

412
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,110
that bad guy simply just have to say
geez I see that return

413
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,570
I just always return false so it's a
simple

414
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,919
a way to get around that want one count
one function you can compromise at all

415
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,059
on so with you know if you actually
forced

416
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,630
in line York code you now have these
functions you have

417
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,669
you three different copies on that team
code

418
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:43,169
and the attacker would have to find all
three of those and

419
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:47,519
you know return false on so if one kinda
zoomed out

420
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,460
on the left you can see that it's kind
of a small

421
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,490
this mall he stacked one needle the
developer the

422
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,570
attacker zooms in on that make that one
change one patch is needed

423
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,600
the 232 instructions here's a look at
the code after we

424
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,100
we've been forced inlining see you have
530 instructions largely stack multiple

425
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,899
needles

426
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:12,529
they're not be able to find all those or
if they do it will take a while

427
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:16,419
com so another it again we're just
trying to exploit time increase the time

428
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:19,559
to make it harder to find these

429
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,860
switching gears to your mobile device
management research so we

430
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,110
we actually have a bomb we've we've
taken in weaving

431
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,549
in deployed an open-source MDM server

432
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:33,380
com WI four-putted from the intrepid is
group know folks have me with them but

433
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,370
interest group is actually built on an
Indian service open source

434
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,710
we've taken it and and actually put up a
a nice setup

435
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,370
tutorials to kinda follow to get you you
can learn what to do with the search and

436
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,799
getting them all qualified so

437
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:48,990
with life is once again what we have
this open source

438
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,880
server available we're now able to kind
of bomb take a look at the

439
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,279
the profits on how this works we want to
try to find the limitations of the

440
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:56,850
Indians

441
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,490
back we want to understand the the in
test the low level command themselves

442
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,230
we ultimately want to try to find out
can we use the Indian interface

443
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,510
to do some sort of a single sign-on ap
9007 has

444
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:13,769
starting to provide that were here on is
an open-source technique

445
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:16,769
that went were gonna I'll try to provide
on

446
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:20,110
one actually have some sort of way do
remote app lock

447
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:24,179
a remote app Password Reset and perhaps
even a remote jailbreak reporting

448
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:28,299
technique so on not that we're trying to
duplicate what these commercial Indian

449
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:29,240
vendors are doing

450
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,890
we want to make an open source solution
available to developers

451
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:36,260
and a small companies really large
companies that want to try to

452
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,610
have a little more control over how this
stuff works and

453
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,070
and visual and customization is to make
even more secure

454
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,750
com because no I mean if one has a
commercial solution in

455
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,929
one goes takes take that with
third-party they

456
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:54,090
arm he I still third-party auditor the
audit comes back and says well

457
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:58,149
all these things have to change on you
then go to the

458
00:25:58,149 --> 00:26:02,740
the commercial solution say he can you
make these changes may say sure get line

459
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,190
on here you have a little more control
your destiny

460
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:13,190
so anyway from the some other
possibilities were looking at

461
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,240
so what we talked about with with three
male on this is a free open-source

462
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,220
project Google acquired in a 2010

463
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,059
essentially an email client for Iowa is
really it kinda cool cuz that has a very

464
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:26,769
fast way to do search

465
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:31,059
that with his the front interface for
easy actually open up a huge search

466
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:31,649
button

467
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:35,750
to come in a nice way to go in and find
emails with the it's pretty decent for

468
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,580
on

469
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,630
for actually email itself doesn't have a
calendar or tasks a to do list or

470
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,600
anything just read email

471
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,120
so if we were noticing in the projects a
to do list on that you know

472
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,440
quote-unquote security was needed so we
actually to be after we wrapped it when

473
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,000
I mass

474
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,649
com exactly what we did is we actually
put a password for an Internet

475
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:59,019
put in the basically use the pretty good
for a laugh password

476
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:02,179
we brought in data at rest they were
using a cryptic or data they were going

477
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:03,760
through a straight people safer

478
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,350
so we just added on: shitty signal
lights we decided people cypher on top

479
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,130
of that

480
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,049
com for the run time we actually had a
memory security we were protecting

481
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:15,690
sensitive information like the user's
email and password

482
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,909
on email address and password we had in
the jailbreak antibody detection

483
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:24,110
we've put in the open SSL crypto on and
we're also using

484
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,299
from the I'm St chain and so on

485
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,730
our goal here is this is going to be
kind of our test app through this year

486
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:33,440
and we want to keep adding more by
security controls with an ad in the

487
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,350
inline function shortly

488
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,760
on and in another few quarters we want
to take this

489
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,809
to mom not gonna hire a third-party
auditor

490
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:44,970
have them that it and tell us different
areas

491
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:50,600
that need improvement

492
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,330
so just a little bit about on I met
outreach where we're up on the

493
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,429
of aside under the mobile site area

494
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:02,500
we have a project page we listed under
the mobile tools

495
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,240
section I'm and on we have the

496
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,870
I miss get home page itself

497
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,769
and then with one get to this page you
can click on each particular one and

498
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:14,010
I'll take you into

499
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,010
to get help site itself on

500
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,600
here's an actual lookit on this is to
get her repo

501
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,419
kinda doctored up to fit onto a slide
especially seeing the a control

502
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:27,429
that are out there com all listed

503
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:30,450
in a row and you can see the various
start and forks

504
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,799
that that are there on in like that it's
just right now with we

505
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,889
if one considers an accutane accutane is
using this a single library

506
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:43,460
you grab inmate you so this is more of a
other cock kinda thing you pick what you

507
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,110
need

508
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:48,470
depending on your security requirements

509
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,880
a little more about the hub on so part
of our research

510
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,590
we have to justify you know why we
researching in what is a return on

511
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,399
investment is

512
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,210
you know my company's return on
investment how will this help our

513
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,149
sponsors

514
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:03,590
and so the big question we get is well
geez if you open source

515
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,860
on this how do we know that you having
impact on such a good question

516
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,710
and so what we did eventually found a
site called get a Linux

517
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,450
and they allow you to put a small
essentially inside

518
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,679
your about pages on get have you can put
a small

519
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:22,000
link in there that when the About page
is loaded on get help

520
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,269
it'll actually go to this catalytic site
which then we'll stand the fact that

521
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:27,309
there was a hit

522
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:32,090
to on Google Analytics so it allows us
to at least get

523
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:36,769
you know your head count I how many
times our page has been opened

524
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:42,169
and so on that's been helpful because it
as as I go and ask for more dollars for

525
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:43,130
research

526
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:47,340
on I can actually talk you know you talk
these numbers I can say with geez we

527
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,110
we've had a lot of growth this month

528
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,649
so let's talk about that and so for the
last this would basically live much

529
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:57,200
for left eight months we have we've had
over 25000 unique visitors

530
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,429
30,000 pageviews on

531
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:04,710
mostly built from 180 countries around
the world mostly US Germany and the UK

532
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:09,279
need Hunan China com so for us for many
months my

533
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,000
my research sponsors have looked into
this is great I mean

534
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,320
I haven't they have other get her
project developer open source project

535
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,690
and their they're not getting this kind
of nike's kinda numbers

536
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,360
so it's more just a mystery it's just
brought over the wall and then

537
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,399
keep doing your research you're actually
trying in Iraq to keep the

538
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,659
community lives with these numbers we
can actually continue

539
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:34,510
day he geez on what else can we do to
help increase our community

540
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,620
if you look at the Tom the big thing is
some really numbers are the star count

541
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,279
this is the

542
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,750
opens this is what get have provided
star notion so what

543
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,820
stars mean is this 307 ovum so if you
look at all the

544
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:52,279
project on 307 developers and get have
started to say they're interested in it

545
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:56,740
and the 61 forks so you approximately 61
developers it said

546
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,610
his interesting to be on a fort this and
make a copy the code perhaps can make

547
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,669
changes to it

548
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:05,259
com that from his previous in an
eight-month so we're trying to get some

549
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:07,049
sort of %uh value claim here

550
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:12,580
and visit in use is it is a modern
steadily increasing in so

551
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,480
this has been pretty useful so I
encourage folks have you ever get home

552
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,549
site out there. nunu tryna you know
listed some sort of

553
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:25,480
gauges their usage check it out

554
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,880
39 S Video mom will free to happen video
and it's great for someone that hasn't

555
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,840
been enough to tame interest in IMAX

556
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,840
com we have public release this is up on
the you have

557
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,909
site in its quick little arm you know
high-level

558
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:43,120
to show our a general or BP or CIA or
something like that

559
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,169
we written up in Computerworld on back
in april 20

560
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:49,889
tweet people this last year through the
future

561
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:53,029
on what else we looking and I talked
about this a little bit Tom

562
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:56,909
we especially want to continue
researching our security controls

563
00:31:56,909 --> 00:32:00,450
you know those that we have finishing up
with 13 one actually on

564
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,519
continue their in the animal control
interface

565
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,169
in so one particular area to expand upon
that I love it in MDM

566
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:11,190
control area we've we've actually found
it on

567
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,899
if you haven't on if you're app is not
managed by

568
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:20,210
the MDM server then on you know then you
really can't do much with it from an

569
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,350
Indian perspective

570
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,759
and it's fun it's kinda someone a pain
to take all these after make them manage

571
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,769
so we thought is when we have one app
and have it the

572
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:33,470
single sign-on ap say and make that to
manage that

573
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,549
and so on so one kid so in an app we
could put jailbreak detection we could

574
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:38,529
put

575
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:41,539
the app password on officially

576
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:44,960
maybe you're you're enterprise single
sign-on solution so on

577
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,870
in and that means naked downloaded
through the MDM interface so from there

578
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,080
when a user with log into that

579
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,580
on we would do some sort of a technique
to pass the login information a key

580
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,230
over to another app that is pyro your

581
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,769
enterprise solution on and and with that
now

582
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:06,059
app is launched we could again present
down

583
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:10,049
the user would with them with your login
that way so we're kinda researching

584
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:13,269
to the idea is that if the MDM

585
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:16,630
if that fine on Apple was was remotely
deleted

586
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,769
using the MDM interface how one could

587
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:23,330
basically blocking access to these are
the wraps by just removing that one out

588
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,120
so it's something that it's hard to
describe but it's something that we're

589
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,460
on we're looking at it

590
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,700
as an interesting promise the talk
pretty much about %ah most this

591
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,990
nom does move to the next light so what
are in game you know what we're trying

592
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:37,500
to go we we want to get to this notion
of secure complete

593
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,889
and that's where we've you know all
these applicable of mobile top 10

594
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:46,779
and 12 the 24 Mobile Press are mitigated
to

595
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:50,340
to to a level that we're satisfied with
we laid would be great if the

596
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,139
open-source

597
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:55,850
site itself was self-sustaining com that
is you know more more folks were

598
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,990
contribute to it should be too early

599
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,059
do we pull request know that we're
seeing that with encryption for data

600
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:04,230
but the other controls are slowly coming
along

601
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,330
I'm like military missions research to
our sponsors that

602
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:13,190
the government or or perhaps even a
commercial entity

603
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,819
so I have a demonstration on I'm going
to attempt on

604
00:34:16,819 --> 00:34:20,490
I do have a hardware problem on this
laptop some reason with this connection

605
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,450
mechanism that

606
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,720
occasionally disagree with this Go Black
and so will this go into the screen goes

607
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,359
black

608
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:33,359
to happen

609
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:41,200
Graham was a good

610
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,419
so this is what you see is the on the
app past the a passcode

611
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:48,820
security control we actually put it
together in a small little demonstration

612
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,560
out on

613
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,429
and 2010 they're just going to walk
through it you can do it will set a

614
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,260
passcode

615
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:59,060
minute that

616
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:05,130
finger you to forget but not there

617
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,600
com that's something that I i've seen
some maps that

618
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,819
some seventies to controls which just a
simple passcode

619
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:17,000
in it doesn't think about that forget
password usually if you don't forget to

620
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,650
delete the whole app and reinstall it
here we have a forget

621
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,060
with that means we also provide an
alternate key which is

622
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,930
these questions or just make the
questions and answers really the is an

623
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,850
hour into this

624
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,740
test app you can see that winter in the
app on one can then

625
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,750
change views in getting to the real mom
the app itself

626
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,850
here we have you know we show the Log
Out button

627
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:43,110
com complete with you know pop-up are
you sure

628
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:50,110
to live a long ago and then I will rerun
it again it again

629
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,920
remember the first you know the whole
idea is that we want to try to make it

630
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,030
easier for the developers to incorporate
these so on

631
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,310
what they look like in again actually go
with the forget

632
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,410
technique and so what's the question to
answer a was the

633
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,420
sissies the in a success you

634
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:14,310
you into the right one said a new
passcode no

635
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,310
then you back into the at 90 if you're
if you're if you're

636
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,470
you work for an enterprise company they
have a ninety group the IT group gonna

637
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,310
love the fact that it comes with a
password reset because

638
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,790
it. helpline he can call from a password
reset so again this is another way

639
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,330
to increase you know usage of mobile
applications

640
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,750
just to make it easier my difficult for
it.

641
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,240
group so there is also a reset password

642
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,190
passcode button in the air where one can
I can answer questions

643
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:46,620
and great in and reserve properly now if

644
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:52,110
along the way come this actually has the
various controls

645
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,320
for I met in there so

646
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,130
if things like com if one tries to

647
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:04,400
you know trying to hack into this in a
way like display doing forget password

648
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,510
any type in the wrong things on you know

649
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:11,250
questions don't match images dies
doesn't let the user

650
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,840
rerun rerun over over again in the fall
harder just to give you a a cop

651
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,970
to a contrast to that here's another com

652
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,760
free open-source passcode app itself
there

653
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,330
com it out and get home and essentially

654
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,580
with nice but this isn't excellent user
interface com real simple to use you can

655
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,860
said it looks very similar to the old
login screen so

656
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,160
I O S 65

657
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,830
mom interchange things like that if you
actually look

658
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:44,850
in the code %uh what's going on here on
you you know

659
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,990
yes but yeah probably not but in the
code itself they basically have a

660
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,440
single-arm

661
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:56,480
password in a single password

662
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,580
method that is doing this

663
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,700
hear his radio just as good

664
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,770
on anyways it's real simple and if
Innova develop a grad

665
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:11,120
took this they would they would the
whole back and is isn't there looking at

666
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,550
skirts

667
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,430
echoed in the screen is hard to see so
maybe just encourage folks to

668
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:21,290
head over to our side and and check out
I'm at I have a little time someone to

669
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,600
jump to a couple more slides on

670
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,000
we actually did a third-party audit love
on

671
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,420
I let me talk about it refers each
reader is a and

672
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,420
another minor internal research
prototype

673
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,080
in healthcare space so this is a base an
iPad app

674
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,690
that allows 12 efficient open source

675
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,290
patient-focused at and so are you can
actually put help it is to help

676
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:48,360
you were 31 people your own medical
records in the family's medical records

677
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,570
you can imagine the this is this
information needs to be protected

678
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,930
so on your ass secure this when I'm out
com

679
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:58,220
essentially they asked us to do an audit
on you know

680
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,400
to give us the requirements 33 is mostly
offline the application security is

681
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,850
basic needs to be bolstered

682
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:07,520
was interesting is that the developers
on the project on

683
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,890
said hey we're using on you know data
protection

684
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:15,160
and we have a passcode it secure com so
we actually when their data forensics

685
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,050
test on this

686
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:19,570
we had synthetic patient data not real
data

687
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,940
we actually used a disorder nom

688
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,490
the Defense Department kinda
applications staying at the time

689
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,060
the mobile application essay geez we're
not yet so we've just a grisly big

690
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,840
security requirements checklist

691
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,420
to take a make an assessment of the app
initially and then when we

692
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,760
did our audits and then the added more
security we did more on its

693
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,850
on so essentially on news in this Dec
there was 255 total criteria

694
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:48,740
we found that they were I seventy where
applicable to a trader at the mall

695
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,670
prototype

696
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:54,110
our initial assessment was that only
twenty-seven pastor sixty percent

697
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:58,310
I'm so the developer thought it was
secure because they had data protection

698
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,350
but under the covers using all of the
different frantic tools

699
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:05,110
we were able to easily bypassed in find
the synthetic

700
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:08,790
patient data which was a day to
compromise surface ever wanted

701
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,900
we got it down to 72

702
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,920
criteria past and only a failed so we

703
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,040
in a way we've increased the security of
the up the application

704
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,300
five times and that's just you know
using this listing requirements and then

705
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,260
of course the iMac security controls

706
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,510
so going back to mom that was 11 way to
kind of get out well

707
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,540
what are we doing and I'm asking is it
effective another way was we actually

708
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,770
brought in a a

709
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:39,340
a third-party company via forensics and
they actually took

710
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,750
each reader that was bolstered with IMAX
and we have them

711
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:47,020
run all their tests on it on and was
interesting is that

712
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,080
like I said network was in our focus
they did find a couple a network

713
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,060
problems

714
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,670
com but they also found the sequel a
database key was in memory

715
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,550
in that was a a slight on our part so we
we fix that

716
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:01,710
and we had a at the time you have a we
don't have the right

717
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,080
technique to store their key and make
that

718
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,160
make that more secure now we do arms we
mitigated that

719
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,380
are gilbert detection and Connor
debugging worked really well as matter

720
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,200
fact

721
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,290
their claim was there when it spent 23
days on this

722
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,740
on at the end of day two they sent us an
email it said

723
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,930
hey could you send us another copy of
the app

724
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:26,610
with how to jailbreak debug detection on
because we're having trouble getting by

725
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,040
that

726
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,070
I was like alright Nandanam tender

727
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,230
we got an email for hours later that
they managed to find it in and patch

728
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,050
over it

729
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:38,950
but it was so there we slow the attacker
by possibly three days

730
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:43,150
which is pretty cool not so after your
we can to mitigate this we know we

731
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,220
concluded that we

732
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,190
we passed the test with the point is
that the see these controls that are up

733
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:51,510
on github com have been vetted by a
third party

734
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:55,080
on and we plan to do it again so this is
against saving

735
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,000
labor in effort for enterprises that
want to get into the space

736
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,500
on I mister that for you

737
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,500
so I think I want to show you before and
is that on the site itself

738
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,400
I encourage you to check out these
particular control cuz we actually get

739
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,940
into the CW ease

740
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,000
a particular on I love you know

741
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
weaknesses that are out there so if if
one

742
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,420
so one has a on a

743
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,550
security architect come to them and say
well gee you to make sure we

744
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:28,000
cover the CW Rees meet these
requirements for developers and high

745
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,260
going to the security controls check it
out on the actually list the particular

746
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,120
twee

747
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,680
that this covers we actually list the
SRG in

748
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,960
dig requirements that are in there that
we cover as well so

749
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,760
here tonight mapping out pay my security
guy said I gonna do these things this

750
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,530
control

751
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:48,050
does those things on use this control on
an you know so it's a nice way for

752
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:51,340
on a dev team to say you know he some

753
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,400
we've covered the security requirements
so that I mean ultimately you're

754
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,770
probably gonna get your app

755
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:59,310
third party vendor that it again which
is fine it but

756
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,730
in with a knife you should be able to
pay to the side to the third party we've

757
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,140
done all these things and

758
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:08,070
on I think when i met your mobile very
likely

759
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:13,850
get a passing grade the questions

760
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,960
