1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,520
alright thanks I'm so your banker
condone

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,930
Mirko CEO in CT 0 NT objectives

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,219
I we do web app scanning our product are

4
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:15,830
key product Ventura spider mom

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,279
we focus mostly on webapps but we begin
and branching out into

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,510
ideal mobile solana stock is really
gonna be about dealing with the love the

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,520
mobile app's

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,790
I my blog remembers his web app

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,920
dot com podcast I often there as well

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,399
so feel free to check that out
brightness talk

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,930
is the you know titled The

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,480
backing fancy sportsman's really much
more now it's really just kinda

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,800
about away I'm starting to attack a lot
in the the new wraps and I'm seeing

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,150
and so we're not gonna go a little bit
over some more hacking what 101

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,470
mccumber the seven deadly sins %ah

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,440
and all get into that the a and then
we'll do some examples a some hacks that

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,530
I've actually done

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,890
I against various mobile app's and

19
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,090
and will wrap it up so the

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,360
first part of it is just understanding
how to do mobile hacking

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,380
I'm wearing a really start want to come
out how your set up for this

22
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,250
job one other things that I really
encourage is to look beyond the device

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,110
in your hand

24
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,040
a lot of people are focused on the
mobile binaries and

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,620
and other some you know privacy
information there some

26
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,930
now local storage issues that they have
I by

27
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,370
by and large I don't think it's as
interesting as what's going on behind

28
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,580
the scenes usually these abs are talking
to a server

29
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,420
and that's really what I want to look at
so that's already breakdown is Lou

30
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,320
look at how to start looking at that
traffic now what it looks like

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,490
understanding the session session
management issues and then

32
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,240
start you know doing hacks so

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,869
the first didn't just get in there and
start looking at the traffic I

34
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,710
one of the best ways that I've found is
the wifi pineapple

35
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,689
this is a very portable little device

36
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:12,700
under the older version the mark for
mark five is the

37
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,970
only the two antennas but this little
guy in the very portable

38
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,049
wifi hotspot that's run on Linux

39
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:23,370
platform you set this up so they've got
to

40
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,540
will do is take this this setup where my
my little

41
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,409
wifi hotspot you know from my mobile
network provider

42
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:33,519
think that with my laptop remember proxy

43
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,299
got the wifi pineapple and now I can
start broadcasting as like ATT wifi

44
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:42,379
right Sr offering real internet access

45
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:46,590
from my device saw sit down and also
heard all set this up in the mall

46
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,450
and turn it on an all the sudden

47
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,400
time the device to start connecting to
me right because

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,719
you know I know any in the one other
nice features

49
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,480
love media my pineapple is common mode

50
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,439
where you actually set it up to listen
for any other connection so if

51
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,569
a device is looking for an SSID doing
the probes

52
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:12,230
now looking for a home network or ever
it'll actually respond and say sure

53
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:12,939
that's me

54
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,519
right to get all kinds of devices
connecting to you

55
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,319
with the pineapple I so

56
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,859
that's a fantastic way to do it very
portable a set this all up

57
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:27,299
and few little lax now commands the
setup

58
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,379
by a transparent proxy so you can force
all other traffic through

59
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,400
and my way my slides will be posted
their online so baby wants those

60
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,549
Bob but pretty easy to run all the
traffic

61
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:44,859
to my box where my neighbor proxy so all
the port 80 traffic all the 443 traffic

62
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:45,949
is going through me

63
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:50,379
saucenao the mall with this K and I

64
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:53,749
get all these devices connecting in just
her written there watching

65
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:58,209
answer saving everything I'm saying I
and I'll go home later Inc

66
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,459
and use this data to analyze what's
going on see what sessions I can take

67
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,199
over all kinda stuff we'll get into that

68
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,419
so I'm really giving away a few lee's
wife by pineapples I think

69
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:10,919
two or three among so if anybody brings
me their card

70
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,150
I have been on a card write down your
name email address

71
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,660
just drop it up of appear in our after
the talk

72
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,269
and the are given wake up a little
dropper hack anything

73
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,680
I'm so

74
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,660
we start looking at the Trafford you
have to figure out what you're looking

75
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,120
at

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,180
a lot of these formats are different we
know a lot of the a lot of us are used

77
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,830
to

78
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,990
webapps and the standard me me perform

79
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,690
made me bawl value format that we see in
the webapps

80
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,460
that's kinda what we're used to doing
now looking at used to taking that in

81
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,540
doing some serious attack payloads

82
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,830
and you know trying to do standard web
security attacks

83
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,930
yet that's what we're used to and we'll
still see someone that

84
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,230
somehow format but mobile app switched
are having a lot of new

85
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,580
traffic that's out there on a new
formats

86
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,540
I was still see the name equal value but
also seen large a song traffic

87
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,110
on rest in our family getting a somebody
is here

88
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,110
but you start to see new format and you
have to start understanding what they

89
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,680
are

90
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,910
and how to deal with them the really not
that complicated by

91
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,620
you have to get comfortable with them
what you come from what time it easier

92
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,810
to start attacking

93
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,820
so Jaison is probably the most popular

94
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,870
Main St I'm Jays on his kinda like X
amount that it can be

95
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,360
you can vary nested structures I know we
refer to it as the fat free alternative

96
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,630
text for now

97
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,410
its it's a very mean way and sending the
traffic

98
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,800
by far the most popular for mobile labs
you see this when Ajax tabs and when

99
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,560
they talk they're back ends

100
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,600
I you see Jason a lotta places ritual
newspaper jobs ribbon outs

101
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,920
just used as a as a good format

102
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,260
normally I will see is like on the
bottom here is usually one long strain

103
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,280
bed me look

104
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,890
you know scary but it's really easy to
understand

105
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:04,370
up on top I format and it's a missionary
easy to see how it's built a nest in

106
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,560
data structure

107
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,700
and there's lotsa be there can be passed
along in their very conveniently

108
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,350
so you get sparse did say you know in a
nice little I am

109
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,140
you know syria im no multidimensional
array or structure something that's is

110
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,860
nice to deal with

111
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,160
Jason can be sent in different places
you can see it being sent as the

112
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,720
you know I'm parameter to like the
standard meaningful value in it can

113
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,910
pass and merge a song you CNN post data

114
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,710
you see id indifferent in different area
people plugin ever anywhere

115
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,100
but what you can look added you start
getting comfortable with that

116
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,400
it's easy enough to deal with because
ultimately you're still

117
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,540
they're still parameters are being
passed the back n

118
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,390
so %um rest I we hear about rust a lot
and restful

119
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:52,610
a URL's RESTful web services

120
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,640
on rest is not a specific standard it's
just kinda style

121
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,310
love doing things them making things
gonna easy to look at it from a human

122
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,120
viewing and deal with

123
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,280
I and ham programmable usable data in
many cases

124
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,960
you can see in a restful your else my
cup on top

125
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,850
where the pram it to you the directories
are actually just parameters

126
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:20,100
I miss economists serve it with classic
format you'll see it's sending back XML

127
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,210
sometimes it'll be sending back you next
to no response again be sending a CSV

128
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,500
response

129
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,500
the responses can vary I'm

130
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,490
you know someday you'll see mix real
send a classic mean equal value pair

131
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,030
as you're dead and you can receive a
chase on coming back

132
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,460
restful Baggins can do any number of
things are you know Google Web Toolkit

133
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,070
Scott its own structure words

134
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,240
actually just Mike value pipe value pipe

135
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,730
and then it usually respond to the chase
on I

136
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,400
coming back so all these formats the are
gonna look a little funky its looks a

137
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,870
little different than we used to

138
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,020
and no standard web security I am you
know when pen testing but

139
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,669
idea here just a comparable with that
it's not too big a deal one other one of

140
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:06,169
the ones that there is a little

141
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:09,560
lawn is AM out as the adobe master

142
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,740
messaging formatter actions were messing
format the Flash Flex aP's

143
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,970
I need of our PC format is

144
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,340
I but the thing that's nice is there's
decoders in just about any programming

145
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,669
language gonna need

146
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,740
so you normally would have on a web page
is loading up a sweat file

147
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,240
and then miss wood piles gonna be
sending a MF packets in the liberry

148
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,490
binary

149
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,289
a still seems kinda binary objects being
pastor these

150
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,930
you know serialized objects I but
they're decodable

151
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,820
you member proxy support said so you can
to decode those requests

152
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,100
see the values modify am you know do a
single injection

153
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,160
and repack an EMF request up and hit the
back end

154
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,499
so it's easy enough to deal with these
things T

155
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:57,019
I'm so quick question anybody know what
format this 1s

156
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:03,710
T

157
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,850
now OJ's on from the lot and AM

158
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,970
register Jason no rock request

159
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,600
there's actually a banner in the banner
ad request from words with friends

160
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,020
I'm and its gonna time information in
there

161
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,330
my life and work but it's got like what
carrier I'm on what type of phone I'm

162
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,910
using somewhere in there is the word
that I summit on the board of my

163
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,720
playing with words with friends it sends
all kinds information so you can

164
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,120
actually have banner ads that would be
context sensitive to what you just put

165
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,840
on the board

166
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,520
I'm but jason is very convenient

167
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,330
for mobile developers because it allows
them to spend a lotta data very

168
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,150
compactly

169
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:45,360
and compact format the so

170
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,490
when I started looking at the a fantasy
football app

171
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,580
I want to look at him you know I played
basketball yesterday with passive a

172
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,510
bonus

173
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,230
no one comes up so now

174
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,950
we like and fancy fur ball to D&D for
sports geeks

175
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,350
right I really not that much different

176
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,370
yeah I am and

177
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,110
what you basically do for those that
don't know how this works is usually the

178
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,780
beginning the season you pick your
caster characters

179
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,850
I each other teams gonna take time take
turns picking

180
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,060
players from where we were in the wing
they want I'm trying to get the best

181
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,970
players

182
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,050
and then during the season you can to
set your lineup you figure out what you

183
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,080
guys are the best

184
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,500
on any given week no one small players
gonna get injured or they're gonna have

185
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,880
a bye week unkindly the vacation week

186
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,980
job so %um manager roster every week to
figure out your best guys

187
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,120
and then them they start playing and
usually in a head-to-head matchup

188
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,620
against another team

189
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,140
and whichever teams players get the most
points

190
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,560
whens might for that week I'm as me
planning into the denim group

191
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,140
I happily go in I'm so I meet them that
week I was nice

192
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,830
I'm what each player going to get points
based on how they contribute

193
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,140
enough for wide receiver Damian passing
yards they get on sort of thing

194
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,660
so it's important for basketball players
were preventable

195
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,140
managers are fancy baseball is always
different fancy

196
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,150
games I to kinda said their lineup in
get it right

197
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:23,130
hand usually we get it wrong had to make
a whole lot of excuses as to why our

198
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,710
team sucked a given week

199
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,850
Brighton I you know and we also spent
time trash-talking

200
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,470
when we do well right so

201
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:38,800
I'm in Enderby very key so I started
looking this and I was living in a no

202
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,560
wonder how

203
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,130
securities things are and ice are
looking at the traffic alert to the web

204
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,930
app itself

205
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,590
and it was pretty secure million you
know I was doing while the Standard

206
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,200
attacks I wasn't really finding anything
interesting

207
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,140
an idea what's been a long time I'm lazy
so as I don't take a look at them all

208
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,560
out

209
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,690
so i'm good the mobile app it gives you
a lot of the same capabilities I can go

210
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,550
in there and see what's happening I can
modify my lineup

211
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:06,340
my for mobile app so I wanna look at how
it's doing that how is it talking to the

212
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,970
server

213
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,660
so I got my wifi pana I am all set up
but everything going on

214
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,850
so looking at the traffic and when I
start seeing

215
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,860
is that it's making these requests

216
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,960
and looks like sq equals

217
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,850
about the fantasy sports internal right
it's got some big long string

218
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,320
where path was Ella bike principals name
and rank

219
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,360
some I okay that's cool I'm

220
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,470
someone start playing with this and I
start doing some attacks I didn't find

221
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,010
any easy way to

222
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,210
do sequin Jackson apparently they're
using something called why sequel

223
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,310
as the %ah who's back and I'm and so was

224
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,350
was needed doing real good sequel
attacks

225
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,390
but are looking at what's that was
actually sending what's the data that's

226
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,230
being sent

227
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,630
and then then brain strain I spread it
out it's just an XML document

228
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,740
I it's got the player ID is number and
their position

229
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,830
I'm so it shows there's their starters
up there and they got some guys on the

230
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,020
bench in asthma red

231
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,070
I'm some time to look at an Aug in this
is all it's doing every time I'm change

232
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,460
my

233
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,690
roster missus what's happening so

234
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:16,860
do not use myself isn't as fun so I
wanna start understanding more about

235
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,300
what's going on I started doing an
investigation on drilling white

236
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,630
I know how can i mess with other teams
kinda knowing this

237
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,880
misinformation what will I do so kinda
let me down a path to understanding how

238
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,590
mobile app's communicate

239
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,790
and how they manage their sessions and

240
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,040
this is really where the seven deadly
sins ver no lab session management comes

241
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,760
into play

242
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,950
I one understand how do they
authenticate users and do this right

243
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,810
you know where they do this right when I
do is wrong suburb is down

244
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,970
and I'm basically what you have is

245
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,550
one is that your you're trusting the
client K

246
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,090
so that's usually the first step the
wrong they'd always right requiring

247
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,090
cribs in time to go through each in
these here

248
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,320
allowing lifetime sessions not keeping
secrets

249
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,160
along repeat request no curfew on these
requests

250
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,590
and then failing to prevent altered
request just aren't looking kind where

251
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,810
were the mistakes they make

252
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,590
first one always is trusting the client
K it always starts here

253
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,960
now people learn they build a mobile app
and they also build the

254
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,480
the bag and the kinda trust the traffic
would only ever come from that mobile

255
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,150
app

256
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,400
and I that's where the mistakes always
start games that's number one

257
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,040
number two is I'm not require incursion

258
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,140
I see AV vast majority in the abs

259
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,200
are not doing any kind about her cell
they're just running over straight port

260
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,120
80

261
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,830
I you know when you're using a mobile
app you have no idea it's not like a

262
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,010
browser where

263
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,070
and the lock icon the tell you that
you're on a secure site or not

264
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,690
there's no analogous feature in mobile
app's night you just left

265
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,440
unaware unless you start looking at the
traffic yourself no clue

266
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,560
I I also see that a lot of the ones that
are using SSL

267
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,530
do it wrong and the don't require a
valid certificate

268
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:12,340
so if I'm using burpee know if you
remember proxim for has its own SSL cert

269
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,900
right most absolute take me SSL cert
from barb just fine

270
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,000
matter not doing any kind a check I'm

271
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,790
I've seen them they do check and you
wanna balancer cuz a little bit they

272
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,870
said in the you know when they're doing
dev

273
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,870
Bob and what times I'll turned off
because they wanted you their self

274
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,920
signed cert

275
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,810
but the if your man in the middle

276
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,510
I most I'm not arm will check in a
certain do wanna balancer

277
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,010
they don't do the a they don't check

278
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,450
the assert authority they're just going
to accept that certain on its word

279
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,820
and I'm so they don't check the cert
already and if you man in the middle in

280
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,930
Canada cheat on them that unless they're
doing

281
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,560
SSL penning which most are not doing so
simple as Ulster paper stuff works

282
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,520
really well

283
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,930
so and the register actually did their
own they had the stands pretty similar

284
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,840
results

285
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,410
I think they actually think it's worse
than I do but and you look at that

286
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,810
article if you want

287
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,520
sewing now number two number three is
allowing lifetime sessions

288
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,150
mobile app's tend to allow a session
lasting very very long time

289
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,540
and there's reason for this you know
what I'm you know users

290
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,030
just want to click on a button have the
app launch and do what it's supposed to

291
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,560
do

292
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,160
they don't like entering the password
every time I'm

293
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,330
and the form factor mobile device is
terrible for entering a password

294
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,870
so people don't like to do it and when
they do when they are forced to do so

295
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,700
they have really weak passwords

296
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,980
so mobile app passwords are pretty bad I
also see some abs

297
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,910
buttered using the wrong type remain
firm Asian to authenticate the user

298
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,170
I've seen some that I use the and the
IMEI

299
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,490
and the device might have it so scary as
it's all security number its

300
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,170
you know it's a I little card number

301
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:00,070
to identify that user and nothing
terrible mechanism because those are so

302
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,510
easily stolen

303
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:06,030
that you know once I know that it's open
season and all get to my hacks later

304
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,380
they can depend on that

305
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,720
and then I found some interesting stuff
there so

306
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,920
miss this not timing out the session is
a problem

307
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,680
they also don't keep secrets I'm

308
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,510
you know in the web security world we've
had been stuck with the fact that

309
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,890
now we detain you can really storfer
really managing a session is

310
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,600
like a session cookie I you can't really
store any secret date on a browser

311
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,950
I and so if somebody's man in the middle
magazine the traffic they can still the

312
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,610
session ID

313
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,610
we're just kinda like stuck with it
right mission of 5 stars to answer some

314
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,900
that we can actually have some local
data store stuff

315
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,970
that won't get sent in every request I

316
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,670
the mobile app's have an inherently they
can store data

317
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:54,310
on the client that can be used to test
sign requests or do things

318
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,640
they're not taking advantage in this so
want your man in the middle you can see

319
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,500
everything

320
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,030
it's open season right you can still add
a session very easily

321
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,630
I the only thing that we see that they
do wrong as they allow weepy request

322
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,130
they allow the same request to be sent
over and over I

323
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,950
and there's not a lot good reason for
this I'll but what they're not doing is

324
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,340
like kinda tracking

325
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,940
the request me sign in with the nonce by
a number used one so that

326
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,660
when they send it the server would have
a list them all the nonsense used

327
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,480
and if it's one that you use to ready it
would reject the request now that I've

328
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
really got that

329
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,580
because again if I can man if I can
become an the middle

330
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,590
I can capture your request and I can
resend it

331
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,900
might be something I can do if it's they
actually founders work with Twitter

332
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,700
on the recently updated API but in all
the PI

333
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,990
that was just barely shut down in May

334
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,260
K metal the PI allowed you they don't
track non says

335
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,020
and once I captured a request I can
resend it later soffits Twitter

336
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,250
that's annoying if I'm just reset in the
same tweet either the banking transfer

337
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,650
that's really cool for Haiti that could
be a real problem

338
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,220
I'm thinking rescinded I

339
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,740
and it's pretty easy to solve my just
tracking the not just keep track

340
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,560
and storm on the server gang now when I
talk to the guy with Twitter and

341
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,820
actually with Twitter

342
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,130
adonis at Derby side or essay I was
doing light hacking de Mon 13 Twitter

343
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,060
traffic

344
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:28,420
and I'm and they will be able to see
their direct messages so

345
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,290
you know they're they're the checker
direct messages after that I can monitor

346
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,550
their direct messages from

347
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,640
good long time so that's you know that's
not so good for them

348
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,270
but to the pics that they've been chains
where structure works

349
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,870
but to anyway nonce is a good solution
most are using them

350
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,630
new Infiniti don't do in many cases is
time out a request

351
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,830
so given request I'm recorded I've maybe
stop it from being sent to them and the

352
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,330
Middle

353
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,570
I prevented not from going forward on to
keep it for myself

354
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,360
on I go and do that and actually see

355
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,580
that I can send that request hours or
days later and it's still going to work

356
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,580
I again it was a was a bank transfer and
I held it and then hurry scented

357
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,830
I you know and if they created a new one
and sent in

358
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,350
and got them being transferred go I
still have this 1i can send the later it

359
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,300
would still work

360
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,460
that's problematic right I'm there's
reason that they do this a lot of it is

361
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,920
around connectivity

362
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,390
no lapse have to accept that they're
gonna lose connection

363
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:33,370
from time to time I'm you know you gonna
be in an elevator 1 I'm gonna lose

364
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,190
connection for a reason

365
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,610
I and so what most do the whole didn't
bopper

366
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,740
until it gets you not able to go out I
and they should really come I'm these

367
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,610
out

368
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,780
and and all can explain a little bit
wyman 10 things is

369
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,050
if you tie this to the non to see you
say that request is only a lil

370
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:54,690
valid for an hour day and it doesn't get
sent in an hour

371
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,260
the app should just regenerate a new
request that one should expire

372
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,320
and it should regenerate a new one if
you do this then you're not is on the

373
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,080
server only have to be stored for that

374
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,000
lifetime as well if you know the creek
was only for now a valid for an hour

375
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,480
and we have to keep an hour's worth the
nonce is on the server but gonna save

376
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,200
you some

377
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,230
some space there I'm so

378
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,620
temple time stamping on the request an
expiring at very useful to do

379
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:25,070
I and then the final thing is on
preventing altered requests

380
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,910
most aP's made it once a kinda thurber
session

381
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:32,430
you know move its Twitter & Wales and
Twitter example I

382
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,930
if I could change the content between
that's kinda fun

383
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,500
right and how messed around people that
way ever the banking transfer

384
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,060
I a change the account is transferring
to that's a lotta fun

385
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:48,200
right I am and it's easy enough to tie
some these things together to prevent

386
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,480
all love this

387
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,760
right if I were to have the that secret
token

388
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,140
ella se y set up my y la gana Ramer

389
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:01,130
I do some kinda PK I am exchange or even
just her randomly generated

390
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,570
I'm shared secret between the client and
server

391
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,870
that never gets transmitted after that
initial setup

392
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,540
I can then sign everything's I could
take my request and take the User

393
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,910
Content

394
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,750
anything the nonce the timestamp kinda
hasya love that

395
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,930
and encrypt did are you know with my
secret key

396
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:24,400
now I have a secret hash that only I
could have generated cuz I would be

397
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,940
going with the secret key

398
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,430
right when you take all this toss in my
requests all

399
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,600
you know same at the session cookie
about the timestamp a nonce

400
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,260
got my secret key years the content the
server could invalidate that

401
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,040
very easily and make sure that nobody
else could a generator that request or

402
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,970
alter that request in any way

403
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,400
twitter is doing some others content
hashing that's why couldn't actually

404
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,100
change the tweet text

405
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,470
by Tom if you do this you do all seven
steps are you doing this also bring

406
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,690
Christian so it's

407
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,550
you know the encryption is solid and of
course you wanna make sure doing

408
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,210
you know standard bike sequence action
protection in with a very good profile

409
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,350
K so these are the kind of things I
recommend for

410
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:11,230
I'm form how and should be built and how
they should verify sessions and verify

411
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,290
the user making the request

412
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,600
K how why and change the formatting all
this weird

413
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,080
Bob went to so those those seven things
going to the never trust in the client

414
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,740
now using encryption limit the site no
less the session my time itself

415
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,670
using cheaper keys you know use a nonce
times Mb request

416
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,800
put all these together you have a pretty
good secure mobile app

417
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,190
so then I guess minutes around right
let's go back to

418
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:42,470
iraqi fancy football what are the seven
are they doing or not doing

419
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:46,370
okay I start looking at it for looking
at the back in the session last a very

420
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,740
long time

421
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,950
I never was asked to relog and for an
entire season

422
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,610
I they were not use the FSL

423
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:00,510
they had no nonce typeof activity you
know secret key hashing are signing

424
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,540
so all I really needed was a session
token

425
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,700
so again seek one direction wasn't
working but

426
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,860
I knew all I know needed at this point
was the session token from another user

427
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,050
and then once I did that what I had that

428
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,180
I can actually do a lot as them right

429
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,900
I could change their mind up so I want
to get session token so what i did.

430
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,200
awaited knows patient and I'm dropsy
draft

431
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,260
time was coming up and so I'm who do you
think provided WiFi access on draft day

432
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,700
drank I

433
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,950
so I collected all the session tokens

434
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:42,340
and I had everybody is well one guy he
was doing often

435
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,929
is a device near his own connection
combine

436
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,380
every also I was able to grab their
session tokens want to hand their

437
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,580
session tokens

438
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,790
I could do a lot I was them as far as a
written in the backend system 5

439
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,840
simple session times I needed to go in
there take their lineup

440
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,940
right right before game starts swap the
other starters with the bench

441
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,700
way sended and then they're screaming
and crying and having a bed

442
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,190
and they have no idea that happened
right

443
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:17,170
Bob images because the the the back and
was not doing this right in. report

444
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,910
missed ya them a new app

445
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:23,920
so it wasn't really does the new app
actually worth a new API is much better

446
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,050
I use SSL it to them

447
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:31,350
does timeout the things but the only PI

448
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,500
still work so anyway using that old apt
is still

449
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,950
exposing themselves I but it's harder
now to steal session tokens for that

450
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,340
most people updated

451
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,250
but going through this process and
looking at No seven

452
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,980
my those seven then we send in breaking
down as in what I've been spending time

453
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,730
with

454
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,100
looking at lots and if wraps and I found
want to stop Patna

455
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,100
offensive all one's a lot of fun but
there's a lot

456
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,190
I'm interesting stuff that I end up
seeing

457
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,980
as they go through this process and they
go through looking at

458
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,740
what's available what can I do with
these abs I

459
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,980
a lotta maps are not use the encryption
and then they're using

460
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,740
Mike I basic of for the authentication

461
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,950
I hate and the enemy No busy got this is
just like them

462
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,430
b64 cash train I you now see just

463
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,450
a 60-40 code written me out credentials

464
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,620
I'm they will steal some traffic

465
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,340
IRS some data so my Backup Pro

466
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,380
an address book pro they actually ask
you

467
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,820
I with my back abroad as it would ask
you for a password when you open the app

468
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,600
my and CN to plug in your password and
an apple actually load

469
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,950
our show your data I

470
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,560
looking at the traffic behind the scenes
a password is not used

471
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,880
for the communication with the server is
just used on the client

472
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,250
just to make you think you doing
something then there's some kinda

473
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,350
security involved

474
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:00,520
behind-the-scenes it's actually using
static passwords for everybody was like

475
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,360
my backup Colin pro when I'm did the
basically for decoding

476
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,670
I for every request and it was using the

477
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:11,200
and the IMEI as the identification for
that device

478
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,030
nightclub the amount to any I and yeah I
am i is whenever

479
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:19,330
the I could have a bunch of those you
know I've come when I do my ma set up

480
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,620
and I was 12 my Backup Pro and just
cycled through the list them

481
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,020
that I had in front all kinda people
data there's so many people you that app

482
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,120
is ridiculous

483
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:34,100
I and there's really no security
involved I'm

484
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,460
out play words with friends in this in
the earlier this girl you're my process

485
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,440
was doing it

486
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,010
I we're good friends not viable to this
anymore I

487
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:46,010
but I was able to do word bypass word
verification bypass

488
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,140
because man a request when you submit
the word on the board

489
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,170
bit of a nerd words with friends my
scramble I am

490
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,770
when you put your words on the board it
was making a request to do a dictionary

491
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,510
lookup

492
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,520
theme is a valid word so I look to the
response

493
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,920
you know why put a dollar word and I did
another nm dollar nad different

494
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,430
responses I fame in the good response

495
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,920
right and then I'd right to call seven
letters

496
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:15,040
drop them on the board row intercepted
the response put in the good one

497
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,390
accepted it actually sent did and put on
the board

498
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,120
but and I would play my cousin he's
freaking out phrase like

499
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,640
called me up immediately would you

500
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,700
and i won a game do so

501
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,200
but you know its ongoing internal look
in this traffic

502
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,690
look at how are they verifying this what
are they doing I

503
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,990
and we're just friends now they did what
they did the combined the request so

504
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,700
that's one request to submit it but
which actually nice

505
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,650
is in the response if you put a word in
Balan

506
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:53,280
in response have a list a MacBook um
words in a close to that

507
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,470
that you could use so likes think I'm
real suggestion box right there like

508
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,820
part of time usually use that one

509
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,940
so it's a good cheap that way I am

510
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,440
I was looking into other out and you you
lose some standard sequence action time

511
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,919
attacks to missus

512
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,299
Associated Press in the mobile app so
you can monitor to lose

513
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:16,320
right and it's a little rest fullback
and

514
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,640
that would send aid up to international
Jaison responsibility that's gonna

515
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,840
showing the app

516
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,309
I'm telling that will count equals Penn

517
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:28,820
think well middle a single injection
attack in sure enough

518
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,450
you know again she wears right love this
is because the

519
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:36,010
people developing his back and they're
not thinking I'm as

520
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,990
even as you know I mean web developer
make this mistake all the time but

521
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,610
even more so when it's it's done
something to an API that

522
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:47,910
really people on directly interact with
I'm so I see some interesting stuff

523
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,679
there

524
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,070
I am how much time ago left a mensch

525
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:57,010
we happen our genes early I'm going fast

526
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:01,480
I'm bomb was an interesting one and
we've seen this hack

527
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,090
ING keepers wanna found this I'm

528
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,440
Yes No a bump its common older apt now

529
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,540
bite to eat no's popular for a while

530
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,160
I'm but would bump would do is you know
%um

531
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,530
it basically transfer contacted us you
have two phones and 10 Conference like

532
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,630
this need somebody

533
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,730
an israeli what's the bomb so i bum
phones

534
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:27,130
an begin each other's contact
information right

535
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:31,520
the county where transferring a you know
I'm I V card I'm

536
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,100
so what was interesting about this is
it's not sending from the phone

537
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,260
K it's ending to a server and the
servers

538
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,600
what happens in the two devices they
bomb ma'am the event

539
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,340
and so they'll go and send to the bomb
survivors say hey I just got bumped

540
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,380
and this is my location and this is the
time stamp

541
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,110
right and so the bum Surber I will then
pair you up

542
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,320
based on proximity and time I've the
bomb I'm

543
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,590
so a matchup many did each other's
information and you're good to go

544
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,490
well location

545
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:12,290
is sometimes fuzzy right we don't
necessarily GPS isn't always on

546
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,559
and it's not always accurate sometimes
using our unique

547
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:19,830
you know the you know your towers
location

548
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:23,400
solar some fuzziness so were we noticed
in my in the

549
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,480
request from each other devices it had
an accuracy space

550
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,260
like 10 the values was how accurate
those the GPS coordinates were

551
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,360
and I'm more than a lot about under
conditions there

552
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,679
I'm so he would you what we did that
point is I we're looking at the Mosconi

553
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:41,450
that's the

554
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,850
where the copper to know the Dr say
conference at so that the GPS cord is

555
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,450
there

556
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,500
and a certain settings request myself a
little a prescription

557
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,070
that word on my high speed connection at
home with a cycle through and say

558
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:57,200
I just got bumped and I would make my
accuracy rating like within three miles

559
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,260
above the Mosconi right which is a good
space okay

560
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,320
and butter 1 and Western seeing

561
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,340
is that I would get bombs and I get
matched up with people

562
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,620
and so I'm you have that now it's like
okay

563
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,140
what would happen if I respond and would
like among German

564
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,990
you know a rare so I i creamy car there
was a small junk

565
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:23,530
lawyer air Morris we do they would
respond with that I would get their

566
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,799
information I would have that

567
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,980
had some back a rare now I'd see is the
number again

568
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,549
when I'm assuming is there be something
like what the hell I tried again

569
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,500
write a so now let's see these two guys
bombed

570
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,340
right I worry took their information I
gave them a ride back to do it again

571
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,610
now I can go and send back each other
data but I've got the stuff here

572
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,830
and I can modify anything I want you
change your phone number

573
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,620
I can add a malicious link in the
company's URL you do whatever I want

574
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,030
their

575
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,270
right there was nothing in bomb system
that I didn't that actually

576
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,980
they weren't storing your contact
information on their server they were

577
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,540
getting it sent on the moment

578
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:06,380
and I any word verifying clients in a
way they were heavy request signing was

579
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:06,860
nothing

580
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,100
but and Mg key measure to this further
he had found a

581
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,090
a safari bug an old Safari bug from the
desktop Safari

582
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,100
that still work on the I owe us

583
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,429
Safari and with them to get remote shell

584
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:24,350
the link that wouldn't you know exploit
Safari actually give him a remote shell

585
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,690
on my OS device

586
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,870
fantastic I but he just

587
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:33,600
first exploiting the PI's because this
is our gateway to the mobile client

588
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,130
this our gate we'd all kinds a valuable
data and what a fun stuff

589
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:43,280
so know the main process here is to kick
start looking

590
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,399
right I look at these means absentee

591
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,590
mobile market is really the emerging
market I don't think it's necessarily on

592
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,070
the client side either

593
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,710
Bob look me on that device in your hand
it is really the key

594
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,470
start watching the traffic how many have
you have been kinda

595
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,580
looking at this mobile traffic how many
human started attested

596
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,429
I'm going confused few hands it's very
easy to do

597
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:09,810
it's actually a lot of fun distrust are
looking to look at your own device

598
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,869
bird looking at you know connected to a
local hotspot

599
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:16,089
at your local my files are monitoring
traffic

600
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:20,270
there's lots to do for you that happen
again traffic in the body started

601
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,919
hacking absence in this paper thing yet

602
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:26,109
tens and ones that very cool

603
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:29,899
I so again the seven are going to be the
key

604
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:33,830
I'm if you want to when a

605
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,440
our wifi pineapple will ship it to you
and I have one with money but

606
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,500
we're getting shipped to you pretty
quickly next couple days I'm

607
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,780
to bring your car to appear and I'm

608
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,429
that's pretty much it if you want to
copy my slides and got 'em posted on a

609
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:52,330
have been posted here I'll give it your
all up any questions so I guess we got a

610
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:57,530
question answer time

611
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,160
people on

612
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,710
I with regards to authentication know
what mechanism would you recommend

613
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:09,250
you know properly using I am you need
when you're building a nap

614
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:12,140
my passion Ryan so using MDN

615
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,750
IMEI

616
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,340
I I CCID whatever well let me use a
password type a solution

617
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,810
is still fine for that I thank you
should be some pressure on over SSL

618
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:24,240
I and when I recommend is after that you
should

619
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,330
can also have some kind of key exchange
so that the request could be signed in

620
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,100
the future

621
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,140
but no center namely and name and
password is

622
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,380
is fine I'll see any issue with that by
and large

623
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,480
it's just what you do after that when
you mean once you've established a

624
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,230
session how are you going to maintain it

625
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:45,590
I'm and I do see that most small laps
and very very weak password

626
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:50,840
strength policies and again I understand
them form factor mobile device

627
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,210
is terrible for entering a password but
yell

628
00:35:54,210 --> 00:36:00,140
we've gone too lax they think mobile
app's so why you're testing the zaps

629
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,550
a new you do anything to avoid getting
into trouble AQ store

630
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,920
for all your requests and stuff or just
I'm

631
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,540
you know most amid so okay I did talk
with legal about my setup you know I

632
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,570
know the mall with

633
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:18,700
you know an open heart by and I'm

634
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,520
I'm really happy you lie already kinda
meh

635
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,180
User Agreement on though wifi hotspot

636
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,590
and people connecting to me and I'm
giving him real internet access

637
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:36,230
and their I there the default policy on
privacy really doesn't exist

638
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:41,400
so you know it's not like I'm joining
somebody else's hot spot in stealing

639
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:41,860
data

640
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,500
IMing I'm offering that and people are
just making the

641
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,890
but and going in attacking nigga
individual app something is

642
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:53,230
I'm that is a little little risk in
times

643
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,540
I but I do soft touches I'm in tunis
long time and we have

644
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,080
clients that are that have elapsed time
in testing I am

645
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,750
none of these are from our clients
either ones I just found the wild or

646
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,660
I've been testing and I got some guys on
my research team that have

647
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,690
for better in different countries and
they don't really care

648
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,200
this

649
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,260
so how exactly do you pull that Jason
blurb

650
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,850
from the beginning Burgess on traffic
yes

651
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:24,550
I was so just me about being man in the
middle once a man in the middle I can

652
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,330
sit there

653
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,680
now go back on the ice lives quite a bit
I'm

654
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:35,680
back up here

655
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,369
for Mac and I thought

656
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:44,789
so kinda sending this up here

657
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:48,359
I so what all do is all I can either use
a

658
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:51,539
like that the middle and one on the
corner there is my

659
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:55,219
T Mobile Hotspot by chem wipe my laptop
but that have been a mile and

660
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:59,289
and then have the wifi pineapple hooked
up to my computer

661
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:03,069
so now my number by my computer lets you
know it's running on port 8080 right

662
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:07,210
I so the pineapple will be a hot spots
you just take your phone you connected

663
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,160
to the hotspot

664
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,410
the wifi turn off your mobile data
network right

665
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:15,489
South enforce all traffic build-up to
the hotspot and

666
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:19,289
I'm what you'll just are seeing the
traffic a member and so you just go to

667
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:20,430
bourbon looking here

668
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:25,829
your proxy you on and you have it all
their use fiddler whatever proxy widest

669
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:29,509
I am pennies per I like it I button

670
00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:33,039
it's easy enough to start getting a new
day on bikes in although a lot of stuff

671
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,039
with my own device installing aP's

672
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,509
said you know using it watching the
traffic and I

673
00:38:38,509 --> 00:38:41,739
you know there's few aP's that are not
using

674
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:45,650
our web server back and I'm into you
have to look at the traffic in Wireshark

675
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,880
in optimism will

676
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,549
I'm by you know if you're not adverse to
hang out March Arctic can look at

677
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:53,410
rapping there too

678
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:57,690
but most traffic is web two things one
because you have the site up

679
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,969
so somebody's wifi services you know
once you but then a kid

680
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:04,059
you also get all the users emails and
things like that I guess

681
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:07,299
in good reminder people shouldn't other
e-mail

682
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:10,469
and their wifi account be the same
account but his yes

683
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:14,180
yeah the shared password thing all the
standard security stuff does come into

684
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:14,779
play

685
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:18,160
I'm and I do see that like when I'm when
I'm

686
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,239
seen credential being passed I focused
mostly on the web stuff is it just kinda

687
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,630
my own personal interest

688
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,039
wi-fi margin where certain I see them
connecting Europe observer

689
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:32,289
now got a password there now that you
know what your man million do just about

690
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:34,499
anything you want at that point right

691
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:38,920
I'm and in mind when your laptop on the
laptop I actually have

692
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,950
I'm doing Internet connection sharing
any can you do a Windows or Linux pretty

693
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,549
easily

694
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:47,969
I'm so its you know it's an actual
router giving real internet access

695
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:51,989
and I'm just forcing the port 80 and 443
traffic through my burr

696
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,009
and I noticed in the fantasy football

697
00:39:55,009 --> 00:40:00,079
SQL know is a date code you could pick
could you retroactively

698
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,630
after the game changed the date to
before the game in so do very well on

699
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,259
that one

700
00:40:05,259 --> 00:40:09,440
I have been tryin I'm going to now I

701
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,640
that's good idea I'm

702
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,030
yours

703
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,140
lines you know what time does storage

704
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,730
group when would you suggest so

705
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:28,220
I'm he is so we ask it on the local
device you're gonna have like the secret

706
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,740
key there in a store on us

707
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,780
on the client out how would you protect
that

708
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:38,170
division world its authentication token
tokens

709
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:43,490
a time like the SSL pinning type stuff
good reason to learn

710
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,560
okay so just call home

711
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,450
homeland

712
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:53,920
lines right

713
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,460
so what I've seen then there's lots of
ways you can solve some other so if you

714
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:03,630
I am so you know and we'll see what you
get in your session ID and lithium your

715
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,480
secret key

716
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,450
I'm you can still hear even a simple
thing I'm just cycling the session token

717
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,359
everyone smaller want only connects

718
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:14,619
I'm me no man can I guess I could be
event begins a new session token so that

719
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:16,260
all traffic is no longer valid

720
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,750
I and then thats the day to the rest or
on the client

721
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:24,000
I'll really message that too much like
how united stored there

722
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,290
I'm then that's really not wear plain I

723
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,559
there's and I i was looking at was no
talk earlier name in all kinds of

724
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,710
solutions on how to store data

725
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:36,270
securely on the device that other app
can get to it make sure it's in that

726
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,349
your sandbox Basin Authority thing

727
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:42,720
I'm and there are hacks in turn allow
you know you to bust out in the Sam

728
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,910
boxes and stuff so

729
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:47,530
I know how you do it but beyond and that
and by Ed

730
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:51,069
that's the individual client you know i
think thats I'm

731
00:41:51,069 --> 00:41:54,440
it's harder for an app to steal that and
you're only targeting

732
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,110
you know an individual client but people

733
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:02,310
bone losing their phones yeah and that's
another reason why you are a timeout

734
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,560
will will light you know and ask for the
password again everyone smile

735
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,600
I'm yeah loss to my sorry hun problem

736
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,030
and there's nothing as link Facebook has
a feature where you go in and see a list

737
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,560
in your active sessions and you can kill
'em

738
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,640
I most times don't do that in Ohio you
should be should be like

739
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,810
crap you know what it's like to use your
credit card in college credit card

740
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,180
company think get relevant

741
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,190
break kill that account I menu card

742
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:29,490
but most capstone give you that
capability so

743
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:33,330
good point so unless the same you

744
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:36,420
said I'm a broke ass as pawns and in a
separate traffic worth

745
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,830
but sweet if it is as is no connection
are more than the palm chill

746
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:45,120
for the certificates like a the mobile
app that you are connecting to a site

747
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,800
with the

748
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:52,280
so calm sumo stabs don't actually I love
you haven't built the interface are

749
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
using the

750
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,990
the library properly and so that's why
we're saying Islam will accept

751
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:01,360
any certain I you know they just want to
connect to an SSL connection and they

752
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,830
nor the cert errors

753
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,760
I'm and usually because during death
have you know they don't like a self

754
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,160
signed cert again for local box or
whatever and they didn't install that

755
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,990
certain onto their devices can I

756
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:15,670
turn off the air and on place alarm just
went off the air handling

757
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:19,700
I'm very few have the dialogue on a
popup

758
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,080
very very few so long your neck as you
can as you pick the SSL connection and

759
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,560
then

760
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,840
want an MP for you for more than a game
to the destination wrap here

761
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:33,290
exactly bumblebee man in the middle and
its it's the SSL server and enhances our

762
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,200
client in

763
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,480
in the middle as pure in a plain text so
last question how do for us that the

764
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,860
mobile app to talk to your proxy so in
this chair I'll just

765
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:47,070
when I do here is like that up the
device to force all the port 80 traffic

766
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:49,010
through my box which is the

767
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:53,250
172 1642 for into port 8080 that's why
I'm broke running

768
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:57,820
saw for traffic to their knowledge than
other line for destination port 443

769
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:03,040
and the Nelson I got the traffic going
into birmingham

770
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,900
on

771
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,829
well alone can go because labor

772
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:11,559
be sure to bomb bomb

773
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:18,559
on stormy and some random

774
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:26,500
I just the miss

775
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,970
the that the government I'm so I was
really confused here

776
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:38,790
so I will be manning the middle with me

777
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:42,849
doom contact the tsunami are I man on
this one

778
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:47,839
this one all I didn't was I had my idol
proscribe running

779
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,900
hmm on a high-speed connection it's
going into thinking I'm pumping a month

780
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,810
ago month ago month

781
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,710
and then I'm if somebody actually don't
bomb

782
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,760
often win both races and I'll get
matched up

783
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,609
snow was commissioned yeah but have the
recognition problem

784
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:07,349
and in on the night may end up getting
in there on

785
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:11,510
any other questions that

786
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,900
really find any any parameter
vulnerability that could possibly allow

787
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,200
the 49ers to overtake the CA ARCserve

788
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,570
said go ahead seems impossible this

789
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:24,650
it does seem impossible this point man
on we're hoping it'll playoffs but to

790
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:27,970
you know I was down here on the new york

791
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:32,359

793
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,670
so

794
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:38,410
from California am unjust stick with it
I

795
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,120
on anything else

796
