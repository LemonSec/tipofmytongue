session and I'm excited to be here and
there

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,580
happy to show would you are a case study
around

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,210
how to implement security development
life cycle in today

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,880
enjoy the process top its million

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,950
so coming to speak about

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,700
security development life cycle it in a
giant

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,640
some amazing did this is their mission
impossible no

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,090
if you miss comes then a misconception
around the

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,570
security development life cycle in hedge
I'll

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,559
such for example edit housing at take
too much time

13
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:46,880
and the

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,410
since the age and processes that in the
past back

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,910
and you need to ship there

16
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,580
Dhoni's very in a very fast the

17
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,720
back hey you don't have enough time to
implement

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,760
all your

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,620
security controls also some other
misconception about their dad up team

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,930
rode it to the

21
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,130
an edge on the approaches about

22
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,400
and the May

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,490
in & imy two and by implementing the
right to the security controls

24
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,600
there is a an example of

25
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,480
emerge from you vendo that publishing is
there

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,490
website what he sings about

27
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,990
security development life cycle and I'm
sure the this air

28
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,830
vendor is used in many and

29
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,390
yeah many companies that they are
developing beer

30
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,170
in the day-to-day so today's

31
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,610
a it is well known and acknowledged fact
that as our process are extremely

32
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,080
difficult to combine with any existing
security frameworks

33
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,140
and when you keep reading all

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,770
on the blog you find these additional
layers and business today

35
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,770
the good news in that our retroactive
security

36
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:14,290
is very good so your mind today
presentation I hope for a year

37
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,370
I I'm sure met I'm going to prove to you
that there

38
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,780
security development life cycle in edge
on is more than boom in

39
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,140
the I ruler present in this show we do

40
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,070
hour

41
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,320
other product is so how we did this

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,500
this is not the only way to do this
there are a lot of labor of love

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,350
how to do this it works for us and I
hope you relive benefit from it and

44
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,570
inspired to use it for your own is
nursing program at home

45
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:51,430
she thinks about my surf unita is it
there I mean the industry for more than

46
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,460
20 years

47
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,380
in the last four years I may have
focused on building there's the in

48
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,280
c:\program apply for some

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,060
and in the past I use to design a

50
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,270
large Metro could and implement security
within

51
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,910
we need the

52
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:13,720
them from free to contact me too and
indeed does that also mean

53
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,510
in the slight to give you some colour
about

54
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,730
what is an what is security full

55
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,820
LivePerson let's first and the third
Yahoo me I'll

56
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,160
and a what we do so

57
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,610
my purse on is a suspect Rome that
created

58
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,640
a meaningful connections for Ruth and a
gym and

59
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,700
grow in the industry sixteen years we
are south dade

60
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,500
its us from the Phils day we are public

61
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,390
weird care a lot of customers
indifferent but because the new me the

62
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,690
number 12 in the third

63
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,200
amid and Miriam 800 employees

64
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,610
when I came to life for some four years
ago

65
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,980
we were about 200 employees and grew up

66
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,080
up to 800 employees which is a challenge

67
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,010
by itself for the in terms of governance
and

68
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,420
how are you airmen and your is the in
c:\program

69
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,780
there

70
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,359
in German mmm so how well the solution
walks

71
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,630
me money talk our a

72
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,710
there musical on our customer website

73
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,970
and suits we monitor all this traffic

74
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,700
we manage to see one-and-a-half billion

75
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,280
and unique visit or coming to our
customer web sites

76
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,990
so its a lot of traffic a lot of
performance issue

77
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,260
and that these hitting our air data
centers

78
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,290
at the right moment

79
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,320
a we and tools

80
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,870
and the right and

81
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,110
visit thought to engage him and of Fame

82
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,430
and I channeled to engage in it could be
a bad boys

83
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,300
should video and horror

84
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,490
any coupons or other channels that they
are available on our platform

85
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,180
meaning that the right moment

86
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,330
the meantime and poop romance I'll big
issue for the service itself

87
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,390
in order to be fish and then give our
customer died value

88
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:28,340
each months we interact with more than
10 million man different a

89
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,930
visit or by Chet and all these shirts

90
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,470
our store own are not the same terms and

91
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:41,530
for a security guy that needs to be with
the third type of information this is

92
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,140
literally a challenge

93
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,700
our customers are coming from different
well because

94
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,210
can come for me at Big Finance Institute

95
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:58,040
air and the and we have also poco we
have air

96
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,130
has served companies and others

97
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,120
and we operate globally we operate we
have many customers in the US

98
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,260
in Europe and now we are fast-growing on

99
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:13,190
a puck this is the only challenging when
we are speaking about

100
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,580
compliances our customers needs to stay
compliance

101
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,330
if you are is speaking about big
financial is the dude

102
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,370
they have their keep abdicating global
nation coming from those who see

103
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,010
other regulation did they need to meet
for internal use and full

104
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,220
and a good luck to itself and dealing
with all these

105
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,290
if you mean not bored by the light and
the security

106
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,000
is

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,650
a controls anthem

108
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,980
not manage to do business

109
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,360
so misunderstanding means that

110
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,970
security is not optional pro-life though
some

111
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,740
security is part of the rodeo many by
understanding this

112
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,860
then outlined with this one is

113
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,270
that do it decision-making on our area

114
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,139
company understand this very well

115
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,770
and this help us Lord in order to drive

116
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,040
our security development life cycle and
we get the right support from

117
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,070
our management to do so creating the
value to your

118
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,860
and management and poor decision-making

119
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,419
and we'll help you die hard mural
security development life cycle

120
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:32,730
in the right place for for your wrong
man

121
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:39,580
prolonged and the syllabus the first
thing you need to know

122
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,460
and before you even start to implement
your security development life cycle

123
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,790
he's like you doing in your age I live

124
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,540
process first you roll to a discovery
phase

125
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,640
the first discover new things that you
need to do is to understand how your

126
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,950
a

127
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,900
am I'll how a your operating in terms of

128
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,350
different entities in your organization
deciphering Road

129
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,490
the flows the tongue in your a
organization

130
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,680
here are the key players the

131
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,200
take part in a live birth on this year

132
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,550
high-level ensure that everybody can
just to please their

133
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,550
on organization we have this sales and
product detailed a customer needs

134
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,700
the kid there there them

135
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,129
and

136
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:36,319
the market means and they a pro-military
can compile it into

137
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:41,000
use all stories that comes and into the
difference compton's

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,430
sometimes the usual story I'll easy to
understand

139
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,709
and we can match the usual story there a
clue to day

140
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:51,920
today really months come teams but
sometimes the usual stones

141
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,009
are more complicated than we need first
two

142
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:58,459
and and understand and

143
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:00,610
find out to reach a

144
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,180
early months com times the needs to 24

145
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,750
into so to do so we have the this
software architect

146
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,050
and the system architect to support the
product

147
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:17,839
it to identify who and to break it to a
small chance

148
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,579
over the years a sterling create new
users through Fri scrum

149
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:25,180
but for some contains today includes
today and

150
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,149
had plenty to scrum teams and about 200
developers

151
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,590
an

152
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,340
I'm Inc R&D each Scrum teams of course a

153
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,900
includes members as such Scrum Master

154
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,319
the

155
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,800
pulled up to 10 and q/a and developers

156
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,200
teams when you speak about

157
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,870
and this flow you understand that

158
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,010
that's right a giant its about

159
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,230
adopting approach for how you develop
your things

160
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,050
but it's not the kills you walk in an
environment that treats

161
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,160
and if as as stable framework

162
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,470
the third allows the

163
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,430
it different scrum to add more of the
same to this

164
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:20,100
and infrastructure from time to time you
need to establish new API whom you

165
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,310
and

166
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,370
and new connection or interaction
between the difference

167
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,600
the subsystem and for BS

168
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,460
here you will need guidance and
assistance from the software architect

169
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,430
and from the system

170
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,900
architect you cannot is a scrum decide
that you want to go

171
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,089
with a new the type of database and

172
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:45,440
today we had so many flavors if we are
speaking about Big Data

173
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,290
you can have Cassandra you can then how
do under whose number beebee

174
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,890
and you can find yourself bruting a lot
of reaching into the system

175
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,970
so it's not the details we have
ourselves to hockey taken live

176
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,070
our system architect the decide together

177
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,430
what is the best approach to address new
interaction between the different sub

178
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:11,460
subsystem after everybody is happy and
knows what needs to be done

179
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,710
and

180
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,100
it the developer seats too

181
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,920
you to create their the relevant period
and

182
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,500
trip a start to push it in today

183
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,990
air their infrastructure meaning web

184
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,340
today we have around with more than

185
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:35,120
100 the different builds and unique
means the tape comes into our continuous

186
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,640
integration environment

187
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,340
and from this continues in integration
environment

188
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,100
and how to mark the CLI are pushed to
doubt the factory and

189
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,600
said the right out the fact and from
there

190
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,830
and

191
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,490
then in an ultimately play me push it to
production

192
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,840
and finally pond

193
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,970
hour ahead because to move he is there
the new

194
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,310
use all still afternoon e-commerce beat

195
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,830
about how trolls are will and

196
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,650
I didn't forget the security p.m.

197
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,760
in this lifetime because the security
team

198
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,300
and this is part to the message is the
time remaining:

199
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,990
should be each part of the process

200
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,310
you cannot food security think the bone
you cannot

201
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,730
put security team I'm to after before

202
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,290
should be part of the process and you
need to be present

203
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,500
you don't have me to be present in
person

204
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,050
but you need to be presence in all the
part of the process

205
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,780
during the building itself so after we
come in a bit

206
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,610
about the flows let's see how and a
scrum

207
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,240
and and acts services

208
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,370
nothing new this is the

209
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,620
standard slide off a giant and

210
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,560
at worm herded for the bedroom but we
spoke about

211
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,640
com into the spring bedroom you choose
your AAA

212
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,190
use the stories that needs to be a

213
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,930
provided in the coming loose and in a
period in between most to

214
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,910
for four weeks red a them %um

215
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,779
daily meetings of the on the team taking
the relevant task for

216
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,620
for being here him and the specific day
and morning following what will the

217
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,720
cover and see that the owned on the
right pair/pairs

218
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,320
to to ship today

219
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,580
the release a on time of course once
said this process

220
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,050
earns then there is an evaluation and if
something is missing

221
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,170
go make through the spring may claim

222
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,260
for the next release and do this

223
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,340
the

224
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,019
process and

225
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:58,970
he decided to the internally

226
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,459
to find out what out there checkpoints
that needs to

227
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:06,759
a be addressed during the spring to

228
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,149
process and with such for its Jake find
a ride to take control

229
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:16,009
so at the the face from the only
spending

230
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:19,589
we start with security the high level
these I'm well

231
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:23,809
secured the island design it's about
identified the lease

232
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:27,989
and the risk is not hey just the
standard prison that too

233
00:14:27,989 --> 00:14:31,419
most love you probably a aware of

234
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:35,439
such as the input validation and the
right session management

235
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:39,879
and I assume that if I will ask how you
needs to store your apostle in the

236
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,619
database

237
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:45,049
everybody will know and if not it will
find out in the woods in few seconds

238
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:47,059
that needs to be has plagued

239
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:51,339
and we pay him I was saying they missed
something to to to to to

240
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:55,480
this thing is is not take a high-level
understanding of

241
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,220
what is your solution Rockies the flow
what is the right manner to create

242
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,910
API easy to a stateless protocol

243
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,639
or easy test session protocol any are
you

244
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,290
the going to interrupt we pay a third
parties are you willing to expose

245
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,240
open and hoping maybe horribly

246
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,560
a all going to to share a some men

247
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,930
here on your application I love this
needs to be

248
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,010
good have a good understanding will what
you're going to do

249
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,490
in the specific you the story in
addition

250
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,720
you need to understand a compliance
issue

251
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,930
let me be let me give you an example

252
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,310
you want to a

253
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,930
here that benefit from your location
solution K

254
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,470
but then you have custom or sitting in
Europe saying

255
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,190
you cannot you cannot transfer our bed
power

256
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,860
out from your or prepare for

257
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,220
there firmed up that first so here the
problem you cannot go we'd go location

258
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,079
and start

259
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,140
spreading the doctor and a

260
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,500
affecting our customers the compliance
this is an issue

261
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,950
hair that could could cause you look

262
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,350
lost a customer and if you don't and
they identified

263
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,510
at first before we even start to develop
he will be

264
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,089
a

265
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,269
them in a new problem in which a
customer

266
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:24,089
and of course a user experience

267
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:27,180
and it usually done by the UI you need
said people

268
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,180
but the man now you are developing

269
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,370
and security control you wanted to be

270
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,480
consumed by your customers in in easy
way

271
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,509
so you need to decide are you aware

272
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:43,600
a past dream in your application meaning

273
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,759
you are not going to create and operate
or so

274
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,790
I will pop up today the user and
password complexity

275
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:56,269
an approach for my customer at the IPAA
point when you got to this process

276
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:59,889
and this is also thinking about the
business

277
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:03,470
thinking about how you need to to do
things

278
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,779
and in the right place a high level
design don't stay at this time both

279
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:09,140
things like a

280
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,079
input validation and and other stuff you
need to see the

281
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,000
the big picture the business picture the
compliance issue

282
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,020
then their web application and cork

283
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:28,000
or application is security the next
phase will be displaying planning up to

284
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,500
everybody understand what needs to be
sold

285
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,399
me goal to do some discovery phase

286
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:37,919
me start who here and

287
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,140
define how we are going to address the
needs

288
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,980
and we're going to do so and

289
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,980
during the sale process the developer
would find himself a week some concerns

290
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:53,080
cool

291
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,510
papon strains that we put ahead at first
and we need to have been some

292
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,010
typeof guided missile how to do things
right my message earrings

293
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,440
a be strong relationship

294
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,320
we chill R&D and make yourself available
at any time

295
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,880
head to head them understand and

296
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,149
when I'm speaking about and a good
relationship it's not

297
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:23,649
don't start in the spring planting it
starts when you train them when you do

298
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:25,140
some demos today

299
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,279
to do to your developers and create
awareness

300
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,600
this awareness mean and a mid

301
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,260
we be a self-starter for the developers
to start

302
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,260
asking question when they are a
designing the dissolution

303
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,580
and this is a a very important this step
in there

304
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,000
in the process the next one he's

305
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,520
when you come to do the up to new york

306
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,580
okay everybody knows what needs to be
done

307
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,070
we spoke about it with me we did a lot
the meetings

308
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,059
now it's the money time come to her
let's start full

309
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,750
and and the developers the

310
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,600
the his asked to do for example input
validation

311
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,700
which it which I will take this example
through my

312
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,799
my

313
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,929
presentation and during the third input
validation

314
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:22,230
and we forced into to use the is
stopping for example is a frame ok

315
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,249
leaving this as the

316
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:29,450
from scratch each time meet someone

317
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,460
and already in the past today did it not
me knows that the

318
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,999
create some friction you need to said
the right properties

319
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:41,139
to piece %uh p an 8-2 to define your
regex

320
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:44,830
each time did not each developer is very
trained with this one

321
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,559
and when you ever so dynamic and

322
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,410
is so dynamic K

323
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,970
I'm a company that the

324
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,760
here and more and more developers are
coming too

325
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,730
loop your company it's hard to I

326
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,290
he can't deliver of knowledge

327
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,650
for all the

328
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,000
there for all the developers and this is
something that I

329
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,640
I'm sure that everybody is facing in
terms of how you keep your knowledge

330
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,640
and in the organization so

331
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,270
what beaded is actually me a combined

332
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,800
is said to be PDT is that can be easily
consumed by the developers

333
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,369
in a way that today

334
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:29,840
movement creates and less friction

335
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,150
and maybe and

336
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,900
a group from the perspective of time
consuming

337
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:41,180
after we set our policy in to this
system utilities

338
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,360
we want to enforce it we said the day

339
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,910
the policy now we want to see that
everybody's is the ranking according the

340
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,049
the proceeded to

341
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,970
we set in place and in order to do so
mules

342
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,160
a different tools such as stock the code
analyses

343
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,670
you start the code analyses at we did
pretty fine you will stick

344
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,210
both a verified that each input in the
system

345
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,909
uses only the day

346
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:09,890
the

347
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,850
I'm the PDP provide

348
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,300
meaning if some and developer decided to
bring

349
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:22,690
is on input validation putting these on
regex maybe the best 3bx

350
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:27,180
ever but it's not and the policy of the

351
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,500
here of the company it would fail

352
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,090
on the test and why do we do why do is
do so because we want to

353
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:41,370
to be able to control them and unified
the solution the to bring

354
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,030
in the system in a manner that will be
easy to maintain

355
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,090
and easy to change a

356
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,179
it an

357
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,769
and when needed other aspect so

358
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:57,610
of DC's a when you create the
prosecution use open-source

359
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,690
you committed dependencies to rail
project

360
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,790
and by effecting DC you make impact your
day

361
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,960
here your own security policy your city
and

362
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,490
and this could be in in few channels we
will speak about it in a few

363
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,020
once

364
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,930
we are happy with the chord with czech
teen the build their success

365
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,860
and we do we're on how to make that the
security test the

366
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,930
during this two steps and during this is
steps to me

367
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,290
actually a

368
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,610
here had to be the better visibility on

369
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,440
on their product in and what this is
about to be released

370
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,680
and then we had their

371
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,900
a release and we have a Nextel not been
test some you may say okay text on

372
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,050
Pinterest is an

373
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,280
a is an expense seem it's a long phase

374
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,630
it's a kind of problem I keep so

375
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,490
me me Ron our external penetration test

376
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,550
but we won't a

377
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:05,590
also to collaborate today with our
customers and

378
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:10,910
well open and true penetration test
coming from our customers

379
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:17,000
they do it too folders and two remain
compliant with their internal a process

380
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,380
and babies regain two things one is
transparency we show our customer that

381
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,100
we don't have any problem

382
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,650
for them to run penetration test on our
air

383
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,910
sony's and data on his to improve
yourself

384
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,940
and may doing this me again

385
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,470
our customer confident and

386
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,330
just to give you an idea and and numbers
we're on

387
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,710
about forty different the penetration
thirsty you coming from our customers

388
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,490
meaning that we manage more than to
penetration thirst

389
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,620
and monthly and it's a lot

390
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,330
new if you are looking in

391
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,890
time frame of a and agile process

392
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,960
we are speaking about for weeks so

393
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,230
in four weeks I'm always on there on of

394
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,890
some sort of a penetration test let's

395
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,750
after we understand what are the
controls let's dive into day according

396
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,010
then understand better what needs to be
done

397
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:24,740
so when we speak about calm using you
think about the coded the developer puts

398
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,679
into the code

399
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,240
but it's not only the decoded third the
developers

400
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,070
putting meat and knees spoke about it a
few seconds ago about

401
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,880
the utilities that we provide them to
some in Cicero God

402
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,500
all these frameworks say and

403
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,660
that are provided to us by ross perot

404
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:48,290
or my internal a development and we
spoke about their control that we can

405
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:53,700
apply to eat but then again you need to
consume some dependence is an open

406
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,640
source is

407
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,400
into Newport Beach increase the amount
on line of clothes that

408
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,600
each share product contains our product

409
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,590
when I'm speaking about Ryan with cold
so line of code that outputs from

410
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,670
our developers can be from small the

411
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,840
subsystem about 30k land love called up
to

412
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,040
for more than one million lines of code
when you add

413
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,020
head to be spared

414
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,970
line of calls coming from the open
source here increase the number line of

415
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:23,820
code and

416
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,870
of course you a increase humility so
what we do is

417
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:32,100
for each billion we also hey inspect
decorum

418
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,100
which opens als are consumed and meet
new could buy out

419
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,210
hey what our a open sources

420
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,930
what license the there on to see that
they are lined with

421
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,800
our legal airframe or a we see previews

422
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,440
new open-source in the

423
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,230
there in the system and get alert about
hey the soft or architect

424
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,260
and may also a

425
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,610
to inspect it we'll for reliability is
some of the open source that you

426
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,240
a important to your he

427
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,660
and to a cold may contain

428
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,000
when Mancini is that she will never
tested

429
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,910
on a roll out piss off Hwy so this will
help you create more visibility about

430
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,410
what is your cord

431
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,400
but then it doesn't and do into their

432
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,070
you are %um also the delivered and
delivered their

433
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,779
I am

434
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:30,639
thing about let's assume you are using
Apache Tomcat

435
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:34,330
and you have some function and Fu

436
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,840
KNB cause these fools and this food is

437
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,549
actually on on the dome cut down a
specific model that you in a minute

438
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:46,940
so you cannot see not on your open
source and you cannot see it on your

439
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,309
stock code: analyses

440
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:52,320
that some road on the delivery so

441
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,700
this point what we do is a dickhead then

442
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,889
and the final how to find it a we
provide

443
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:03,639
missed any witnesses to identify what
models were

444
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:06,690
a enabled on the specific project

445
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,380
and a if they are

446
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,480
and run Ubuntu some so to wear setting
we'll

447
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,530
when on CB is cool under the name thing

448
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,530
this way you can screen your called

449
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,470
and in multi-dimensional a

450
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,890
a view seeing the crowds coming

451
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:29,710
the dependency who you bring in the and

452
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,760
and on what platform you are actually
running

453
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,980
after we we understand

454
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,220
how we do this let's focus on on the

455
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:46,269
am on decoded the developer it are using
and see how we exposed API he met in a

456
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:49,739
and rock is there practice to to expose

457
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:53,249
so easy here is the slide it is from the
Los

458
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:57,509
of course and the misled describe how

459
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,549
the subkey he's exposing their API they
are

460
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:04,440
and validate a long trip to New can do
under my eyes

461
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,050
or other stuff that are used in you in
your eye

462
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:11,060
a in Eurocode but

463
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,690
as I mentioned it before using it from
scratch will

464
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:19,640
require in airport for your team and
each time they want to

465
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,500
to use it now the thing that the

466
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,090
real concern you is ready to put your a
validation and this is not an easy

467
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,330
decision and

468
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:33,780
and I'm telling days because we're
global test and feign

469
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,960
until we decided what is the right
approach

470
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,130
so for us we decided the better solution

471
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,850
will be to do and validation on the

472
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,860
business function and meaningful each a

473
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,120
improved had the

474
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,990
it at and the maximum resolution

475
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:00,070
and why do we do so we do soulful few
reason and this out tips that they will

476
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,940
learn from

477
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,320
first the morn to keep the regex and the
input validation

478
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,440
a simple as possible to prevent any

479
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,820
performance issue that may impact your
functionality on your server

480
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,940
the second thing he's when you need to
fix something

481
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,550
you don't need to the

482
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,419
Airfix and and be in the

483
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:26,249
in a situation that you might break
other sings

484
00:29:26,249 --> 00:29:32,489
by doing this you will let you will be
able to apply a specific your validation

485
00:29:32,489 --> 00:29:35,970
a new specific validation now have the
tools

486
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:41,059
hey when stable condition is not
applicable you can do also encoding

487
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:45,269
and now after you understand what needs
to be done

488
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:48,840
you need to enforce this policy because
this is well known

489
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,259
and therefore I most owner developer
lips input validation needs to be done

490
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:58,210
et cetera et cetera but now you want to
expose 18

491
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,249
inefficient that they will help your
developer consume it

492
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:05,549
easy and in an easy way and the

493
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:08,599
to actually enforce the policy so

494
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,940
this is an example of a how you do these
we created the judge

495
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,690
a legendary that the same generic K

496
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,740
their function hedge in every class
between

497
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,960
actual name and deal with the

498
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,870
any input validation we use not to
return to the

499
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:31,170
there to was specifically the

500
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:34,540
there quoting for this class and white
non

501
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,310
let me give you another tape if you will
use Boolean

502
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,660
at the step you my you might find
yourself

503
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,900
dealing with these bring young in the
wrong manner

504
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:49,539
and when it returns to the card and by
doing this you can continue with the

505
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:53,779
Venable value and on record by returning
null

506
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:59,499
you will avoid any a returning a bed
information omissions information

507
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:06,470
two-day continue so the true the second
bodies rot actually the developer seeded

508
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,609
the developer needs to do only get
violent straying

509
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:13,909
and we need to go there in a month is
specific K

510
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:16,989
hey value they told that he wants to
consume

511
00:31:16,989 --> 00:31:23,259
by doing this mean actually eat don't
know what happened be behind the scenes

512
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:26,460
just know that if you use it right just

513
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,970
produce good valid stream could do right
many little

514
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,309
anne's a

515
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:32,730
he's the

516
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,900
supposed to be safe from on this one in
addition to each

517
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,110
Ballina so that we apply reply also a
unit test because

518
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,550
when you walk in a giant sometimes

519
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:51,030
and this a and there is a disorder on
delivery of the different

520
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:55,240
subsystem so you cannot tour on hand end
to end test

521
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,570
and this is a problem that a local here
i John

522
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:03,650
a project facing we provide the you need
is that will help you to

523
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:07,070
measure will proof romance and two see

524
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,260
you fetch the expected input day

525
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,870
and put it on a valid value as you can
see you

526
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:18,540
and invalid value test so we want to
test one for divided

527
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,180
and one for the invalid and maybe if I
did the system

528
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:27,180
more correctly and not fame and this
happens for each been

529
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:33,330
dunning to summarize the big picture

530
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,100
recreate the and life personal security
API

531
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,490
we import eat we forced to import eat
for each project

532
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:45,910
reinforced our policy by any

533
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,590
a using static code analysis is and the
open source

534
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:54,070
hey validation and they delivered their
validation

535
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:58,680
approach each a building nope but its
and its supply com

536
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,800
finally when me finalized who

537
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:08,480
right lol called you want to do it so
keen so we use their continuous

538
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,550
integration and

539
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:14,830
infrastructure to enable us to create
bids and we do these

540
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,490
the

541
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,450
that by the developer taking the cold

542
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,640
he proposed because into this summer's
am

543
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,480
once the summers and identified the new
code it triggers their team city means

544
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,800
p.m. CT is our SCI

545
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,340
solution it he triggers the TeamCity

546
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,950
and the Maven process is thought to

547
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,080
create sureee billion into this been

548
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,610
we just push our and security

549
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:49,309
compliments meaning we do static code
analysis dynamic this than the

550
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:50,330
open-source

551
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:55,000
and like any other system does the trans

552
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,520
in today a continous integration
environment if you mean fame

553
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,950
and this is a critical issue if you fail

554
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,830
and fame means that we identified and
the high you meet you in finding

555
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:12,840
Union fame and to build so think about
him

556
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,700
like a developer trying to run is
codeine is on machine

557
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:21,310
if you cannot come by Lee you will not
be able to run

558
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,960
right both think about it the same way

559
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,609
if UN Security finding you cannot
continue

560
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:31,830
you need to fix them down in did to fix
them

561
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:36,000
now and don't postponed it and create
the bedroom

562
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,899
so this way you will find yourself
coming clean

563
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:43,350
each time you push and goes green

564
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,609
Emmanuel what you know he's gonna raise

565
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:50,200
other states but if you know about
something fix it now

566
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,909
don't wait for and find it later on the
process so put it on the back room

567
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:59,170
another thing with

568
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:03,550
as we mentioned when we think about our
customer business and

569
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:07,940
and how the truck task is driven think
about

570
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,109
you're a developer is the custom K

571
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,970
you want to give him a good a user
experience when

572
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:18,920
if and facing problem with security song

573
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,160
he used to checking is called and find

574
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,460
hand Monti told a successful fend off
the beaten

575
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,740
in the framework of the Dean CT into
this framework we

576
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:34,850
just added the new tab as you can see
him not chosen

577
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:37,410
what went wrong on he's the

578
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,349
on he's been and if the build phase

579
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:43,369
you can easily golden see

580
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:46,780
within the tool itself exactly

581
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,810
what Klein went wrong and

582
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:53,160
get this is Dan say online and get help

583
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,200
09 to have been remediated bourbon
ability that was just found

584
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,770
this way you went twice

585
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:06,060
ron's you increase the awareness of your

586
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,070
developer each time you find the new
finding that he creates

587
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:14,700
he gets road from you know who this
finding he needs to deal with it

588
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,010
truett's self-knowledge to himself

589
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:22,240
and babies he's he's improving second

590
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,190
where and

591
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,840
an where the sustainable security and

592
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,450
living room of knowledge for all your a

593
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,780
and for all your organization because

594
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,750
this is a standout you cannot pass this
time that you need

595
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:43,310
you need to me this time not and by
doing this you are how to me

596
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:50,310
and good to go that lets

597
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,430
summarize what tunes so and till now

598
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,780
and i'm relieved phew minutes the

599
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,810
therefore question soco's where we who

600
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:04,150
the spoke at the beginning the first
seeing

601
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,540
is to do discovery and identified the
right

602
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,050
intersection that you need to be
involved in order to being

603
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,870
efficient in your room security and
life-cycle

604
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:18,350
and the security development life cycle
and

605
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,880
and then message juries be part of the
process

606
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,100
don't wait to be at the end of the
process being boned

607
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,230
each checkpoint decide which 0 are in
name

608
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:33,600
Ricciardi good point that you created
the maximum

609
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,580
impact on the decision before it happens

610
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:42,530
and one sOooo a become part of the
process

611
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,840
it becomes part of the DNA a mural R&D

612
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,980
and it's not strange to them it's not
the bad guy that comes with the head and

613
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,450
say

614
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:54,190
you did this you did that the

615
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,720
their developers it's a itself consuming
he

616
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,850
goes to the banner he's seen the problem

617
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:06,790
gets online help you resolve the problem
he finished gardeners

618
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:10,140
because you for always presence in these

619
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,470
live sunken second is

620
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:19,590
reduce friction you want to reduce
friction by

621
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:25,500
and settings and consuming your solution
in Europe only seen in easy manner so

622
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,120
put the package put this at the
utilities to be consumed by your

623
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,160
and

624
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,540
developers in a way that Minot the

625
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,000
have to be the sole have the process to
be

626
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,690
very simple consuming like me so

627
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:46,080
in the input validation we do so also
for encryption

628
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,290
for aunty some need someone and already
deployed ninety-some he knows

629
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:55,820
how preaching these to define the XML
find it creates the potency

630
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,960
so on and so on hand and make by and
doing this

631
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,520
you would use then mount the knowledge
that the developer needs to do in order

632
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,270
to

633
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:10,890
to achieve his task scream and enforce
your potency

634
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,190
on what needs to be done we create that
the policy

635
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:18,140
we published it to everybody now we need
to enforce it

636
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,750
me reinforce it by putting a

637
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,780
and and this brings me to the next prime

638
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,890
and using automation and collaboration
between the different system

639
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:34,070
where the CI environment let's start the
code analyses

640
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,850
interlock between them create automation

641
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:41,880
understand the process you wouldn't you
want to put in place and once you

642
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,140
understand the process

643
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:50,140
build it into an automated way the next
item

644
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,020
is to create confidently chill customer

645
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,900
don't be afraid on social security by
obscurity be opened

646
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,420
if you have a problem you want to know
about it you don't want to hide it

647
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,540
want to to let others

648
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,980
it best to you and feel confident with
the service

649
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,109
if you don't do this you will be

650
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:14,289
be how to do business with a large
enterprise organization

651
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:19,410
if you are a SaaS provider you you for
sure more on that

652
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:23,450
when it comes to do business you get to
a point

653
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,460
where the security teams is involved and
stopped asking question

654
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,880
what is your not the retention policy
what is your how do you deal with PI

655
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,140
and then if there are any findings

656
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:39,960
you cannot pay go live with this custom

657
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,369
the second part under a condition are
more about

658
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:47,249
how you treat your opponent on the
organization

659
00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:50,329
so reply for song head coach

660
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:51,480
and the

661
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,780
day and coach champions a US Commerce
third with take leaders

662
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,690
would take cam me take dem and

663
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,500
am on hands-on training and creating

664
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,170
value to them to understand what is this
a cutie problem that the

665
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,109
they can name can be both but during
that decision

666
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:15,520
meet me show of course a lot of
information

667
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,630
and

668
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:20,180
and and train horror

669
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,790
developers on a regular bases in
addition

670
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:27,830
will create a knowledge base and the
knowledge base is not just a roundabout

671
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:33,240
our so miss for example the last third
incident if I had to be where the most

672
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,020
and more than 100 one

673
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,539
53 million a records over the

674
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,619
the immense and

675
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:48,460
and and user passwords and the security
question include text

676
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,819
so runs in the middle Percy this

677
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:55,259
read about it when it comes to do some

678
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:55,880
I

679
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,880
is sort of the same he's he's aware
there

680
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,289
and the next thing is and it needs to
come chill

681
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:10,849
and management decision and to break the
beamed

682
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:14,380
in Ohio me June to to approach this is
step

683
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,400
you need to trim they mature enough

684
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,490
to do so because if you don't human
create noise and the snow is in R&D will

685
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,019
not

686
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:25,349
impact when you're here

687
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:28,390
day-to-day woke and will create

688
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:33,269
a lot of tension between the different
it parties on your way company

689
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:37,339
the one that wants to move should be the
day

690
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:40,320
the release on time and and the

691
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,840
the one that they will needs to go and
fix it then its entrance entrance so

692
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,020
so you need to puke on finance a

693
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:52,100
reduce the false positive in the process
in order to do so

694
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,110
what they recommend is to start small

695
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:58,800
but think be what does it mean stop you
there

696
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,090
the smaller the project don't start to
meet

697
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:06,220
and knowing everybody in R&D when you
start to do so

698
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:10,120
you will a understand better what our
day

699
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,049
roadblocks that can they

700
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:16,549
have faced you during this process make
this a success story

701
00:43:16,549 --> 00:43:21,119
and start to convince the other teams to
join this program

702
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,640
and step-by-step you can

703
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,480
see how it grows and believe me and it
wasn't started the beginning to do so

704
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,450
but once it actually created to success

705
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:39,760
teams wanted to join this program and
wanted to be part of this process and

706
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,460
today

707
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,570
these presses goes for all the

708
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:48,860
subsystem we have the company and of
course

709
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,160
it's a never ending story you need to
feed is

710
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,490
a program all the time and to make it to
the

711
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:00,270
lives seems they are getting a better
you have new

712
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,460
pulled up can that can help you achieve
the

713
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:10,290
there the solution

714
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:15,350
i'm open to breast and of course a few
not covered the question you can the

715
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,350
ask him me during the say II will be an
element

716
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:23,210
hi great presentation thank you I'm

717
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:26,680
you said you had 22 a natural teams
running

718
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,370
wanted the ratio the security people to
that in what worse they play on those

719
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:31,910
teams

720
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:36,290
so we have moved into a very good
question we have

721
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,839
22 scrums reply on the developers and we
are five the

722
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:44,400
people on day security

723
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,079
team but merely also operational
security guys

724
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,760
about the

725
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,470
three guys and we also and mentor

726
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:54,280
I

727
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,640
a the software architect and the others
the bball to meet so

728
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,880
attorney we collaborate beat altogether
because you cannot get

729
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,090
to 200 but we r in very good relation
with

730
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:11,620
he told them one with the security

731
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,010
tools the scanning tools like BHP for
fighting longer and longer

732
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:19,500
with more and more rules are coming out
to scan even medium-sized Java projects

733
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,490
it takes three to five hours how are you
more you burn

734
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,790
wheeling downer green a small policy for

735
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,710
quick turnarounds in your builds to be
able to accommodate agile projects

736
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:35,500
are you addressing some other great
quest and of course at the beginning we

737
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,150
stopped me

738
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,950
each been meaning it's believed that
there was czech teen

739
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:43,030
we will take it so pool large project

740
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:48,030
it became the problem because people on
to get there are two fact as soon as

741
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,020
they checked in

742
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:53,140
and then don't want a and they don't
want to wait more than five to 10

743
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:53,780
minutes

744
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,820
so we had this dude

745
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,950
and in a nightly build meaning you can
check in during the day

746
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:05,220
no problem at night you when they're on
there

747
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,880
and nightly been for an art project and
then

748
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,320
hey if you fail you cannot continue you
will so I had to me

749
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,369
every bill niskanen its at their

750
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:19,500
and tape frame over time from local 24
hours

751
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,960
for small building for small projects

752
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,300
every time that you checked in because
among other things people

753
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,349
in my committee were concerned about
they said okay during the scrums and

754
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:32,230
sprints

755
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:36,700
suppose somebody changes the design so
they decided different protocol its

756
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,590
the way to do stuff how do you find out
about that just rely on their awareness

757
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,859
that that's important

758
00:46:41,859 --> 00:46:45,599
is a retard affect the grade you can
check how do you catch

759
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,710
decisions their security impacting

760
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,920
in the middle of their process on so

761
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,000
it's about awareness of and the team's
approaching you with the quest and and

762
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,349
find it during the spring planting

763
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:04,640
but today the if you're subsystem needs
to speak with another subsystem

764
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,099
you you cannot commit this establish
connection be

765
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:10,750
be. if you don't go today

766
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,340
is sick is so for architect and we are
very

767
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,590
tied to the software architect me more
in the

768
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:21,610
in very close Mon we do so for
architects 0 any change coming from

769
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,390
these say

770
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:25,640
best we will be involved there is no

771
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,310
and sleep away on on this but because
they're aware of it great there's no

772
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:34,130
document that they make a check mark in
that you see there's been a change is

773
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:34,490
just

774
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:38,330
those people are aware what's important
to you when they go 2 your

775
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:42,490
sure and there is no way that they I
will not speak

776
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:45,770
two or three times a day to myself to
architect

777
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:46,810
and

778
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:52,080
during the day questions

779
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:57,890
there open

780
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:02,080
world

781
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,470
right

782
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:06,560
of course the that this should not be
intrusive

783
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,980
and no no load test

784
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:16,380
and water I'm

785
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,410
its it's a legal Artu

786
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:25,100
they sign on the local men before the
start up and test bank on

787
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,690
this I could use at just expected that
more about how you got management by in

788
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:32,970
up good he said that was quite important
at the beginning obviously must be very

789
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:36,100
important to get everybody to do this
helps kinda curious they got that

790
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,750
show II thing because of our nature of

791
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:45,320
of the Sonus and me we woke with big
financings the dude

792
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,580
and most of the bong in the US our
customers the follows

793
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:52,640
so you follow

794
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,120
a very long security questionnaire

795
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:01,920
and or the before you start your service
once you go to

796
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,610
this type away a engagement may be stuck
with customer

797
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:09,140
you quickly understand it to you if you
don't have security

798
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,510
you cannot do business this is the
alignment

799
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,730
its business talking in who don't you
know

800
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:23,730
if you don't do security no business

801
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:27,180
how do you respond positives especially

802
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,210
in the night the bills where the break
the bill then realize it was a false

803
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:30,880
positive

804
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,220
press pause it did so we release some
our developers

805
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,390
and this is priority for all pro in my
team

806
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:43,890
meaning soon as there is an issue
indirect go to one of my game

807
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:48,960
and hold to me hey we mean immediately
get the response we look into it

808
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,789
we'll resolve the issue we understand if
we have no possible that the many cannot

809
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:54,619
continue

810
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:57,260
there is time and

811
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,540
going to waste and from the developer so

812
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,640
so real we are well as a security team
today I'm the

813
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,600
means when I say I think yeah

814
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,810
in terms of time and on all

815
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:17,580

816
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,680
