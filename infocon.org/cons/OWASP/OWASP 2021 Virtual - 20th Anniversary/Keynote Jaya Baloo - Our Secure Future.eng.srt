15 most inspiring women in the

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,680
netherlands

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,840
by inspiring 50 which is a non-profit

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,239
aimed to raise diversity in technology

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,600
by making female role models in

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,520
technology more visible

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,879
she has a wealth of industry experience

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,719
and telecoms plenty of time

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,719
spent educating and advising so we're

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,640
very fortunate to have us blue here with

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
us today

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,559
yeah

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,200
so um

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,760
so i'm just gonna i told grant i warned

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,520
grant actually that i am just going to

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,920
go a little bit all over the place and

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,200
kind of

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,680
do the full keynote experience by let

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,759
you letting you know what i think what

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,320
i'm afraid of and we're going to zoom in

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,840
and zoom out and talk about all the

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,759
things um uh and i wanted to have like

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,720
this top 20 list for you for the oas top

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,960
10 but i yeah i don't know if we'll get

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,159
just there

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,640
and i think it's kind of clear now

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,159
that we know

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,400
uh stuff is breaking you know and we

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,680
know uh if you would talk to any cso

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,520
uh i saw the most wonderful thing on

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,600
twitter the other day where uh there was

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,200
someone working in security that was

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,720
singing um

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,960
a sort of lamentation song from les mis

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,560
about everything that's wrong

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,040
to her ceo to try to get budget

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,119
um and of course she wasn't getting it

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,040
so even though we know what's breaking

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,880
we're not really great at getting our

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,600
comms sorted in order to be able to fix

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
the problem

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,199
um and that really points out to the

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,400
fact that we have this cassandra complex

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
so

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,840
some of you may know who cassandra is

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,040
she was a figure uh in mythology that

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,239
basically

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,760
uh all kinds of horrible crap happened

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,000
to her but cassandra

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,840
knew the past

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,560
but also was cursed in that she could

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,360
predict the future but nobody believed

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,720
her

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,239
and i feel like

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,680
a lot of folks working today in security

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,160
have the cassandra complex we all know

71
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,239
what happened all the hell we needed to

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,800
live through to get where we are today

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,440
and we also kind of have an inkling

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
about what's kind of coming up on the

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,280
horizon the next couple of years if we

76
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,360
don't change but you know it's not

77
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,000
really like people take everything that

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,800
we're saying at face value and then

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,879
implement the changes that we keep

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,400
claiming that need to be made in order

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,120
to fix the problem so how do we kind of

82
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,840
get over this how do we considering all

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,280
of the things that are going on how do

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
we actually get to this place where we

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
are clear about the problem all of us

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,760
are saying the same things and that we

87
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
can actually point to a sort of i don't

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,560
know kpis or something that actually

89
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,280
points out how we can you know

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,959
demonstrate the value of the

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,480
propositions that we're suggesting in

92
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
order to fix the problem

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,799
and also like because there are so many

94
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,799
different things to fix because we need

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,640
to anticipate on so many different

96
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,280
scales how do we actually figure out

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,120
between the different opinions how to

98
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,200
get more signal through the noise you

99
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,879
know where do we actually need to start

100
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,480
focusing how do we need to start

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,720
examining the problem which thing should

102
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
we start and stop doing these are the

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,640
questions that i don't have all the

104
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,040
answers to but i certainly think deserve

105
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,280
to be asked yet again

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,879
um and if we

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,280
just kind of get started

108
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,560
um the biggest thing i think in the last

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,360
year

110
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,959
has been our inexplicable almost rise of

111
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,799
ransomware cases and it's no longer a

112
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,040
case of ransomware or rep but it's

113
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
really like a sort of ransom when

114
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,519
um and it seems like you know there's

115
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,600
there's not enough happening

116
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,720
where like we're still like using

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,800
insecure passwords all vulnerabilities

118
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,600
all over the place uh no mfa

119
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080
all kinds of things that we also hear

120
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,160
kind of know better

121
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
uh how to do it but

122
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,479
we see that we're not evolving quickly

123
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,160
enough to be able to implement those

124
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,840
things that we already know about and

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,240
criminals are way better

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,560
than the defenders in terms of adapting

127
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,960
their stuff and actually like they're

128
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,600
iterating their own maturity levels and

129
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,240
we at avast are seeing these criminals

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,000
get more and more and more professional

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,639
they have call centers they have

132
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,080
you know they're selling their stuff as

133
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,000
services they have infrastructure as a

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,039
service they're providing entire

135
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,360
networks that they manage efficiently

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,280
you know behind multiple

137
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,360
kind of proxies in order to get this all

138
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,759
working at scale um

139
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,600
and then they are

140
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
like really you know they're no longer

141
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,080
trying to just make money by

142
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,720
mining for the gold but they figured out

143
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,039
it's about the shovels and the wagons

144
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,479
so uh providing this stuff as a service

145
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,080
means that you're lowering the

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
complexity of course for

147
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,479
uh any attacker to kind of gain entry

148
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,400
into the game but we've increased the

149
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,280
complexity for the defenders to be able

150
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,759
to find out what the hell is going on in

151
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,680
their network because they have evolved

152
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,639
so organically and orgasmically and we

153
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,639
see the kind of collateral damage from

154
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,280
these types of attacks just also

155
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,160
exponentially increasing i'm not sure

156
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
how many of you are fully familiar with

157
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,120
the project uh like no more ransom which

158
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,319
was started

159
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,919
uh by the dutch police together with

160
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,000
europol and uh two competitors um

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,280
kaspersky and mcafee um not just our

162
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,639
competitors competitors to each other

163
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,199
obviously uh who decided you know we

164
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,880
need to work together if we really want

165
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,039
to look at how do we solve the problems

166
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,560
and we're very happy to be part of this

167
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,120
ourselves but where you actually go

168
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,199
there first to look for decryption keys

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,800
or if you have a decryption key in

170
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
another case that you go and give it to

171
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
no more ransom these are the types of

172
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,440
solutions that would inevitably

173
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,960
like

174
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,919
help us figure out how to delay that

175
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,000
incredibly complex

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,080
obstacle of trying to fix all of our

177
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,800
things endemically inherently to not

178
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,880
have some of those insecure practices

179
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
continue

180
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,919
we also need to take a deep breath and

181
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,639
calm down because a lot of this is also

182
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,599
leading

183
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,400
to an increase in geopolitical tensions

184
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,319
because of the impact of some of these

185
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,120
attacks because of

186
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,319
the nation-state actors that are either

187
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,680
behind it

188
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,479
or uh like kim jong who's you know made

189
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,440
an estimated about uh 2 billion

190
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,240
uh

191
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,639
dollars just by doing ransomware

192
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,160
campaigns this is according to a u.n

193
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,120
report i mean there's a clear nation

194
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,400
states who are engaging in the

195
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,919
ransomware and blurring the lines

196
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,400
between cyber criminals and state actors

197
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
but there's also nation states of course

198
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,319
like russia that is actually just

199
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,319
contributing code to ransomware

200
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,199
operations and harboring these criminals

201
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,440
in order to allow this stuff to happen

202
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,479
so all of these things make us

203
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,880
kind of anticipate a global response

204
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,120
where in actually reality what we really

205
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,199
need is de-escalation and cooperation

206
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,479
and going back to that global uh problem

207
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,560
you know we're not making it easy on

208
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,199
ourselves either we keep breaking stuff

209
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,360
and the things that we keep breaking are

210
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,680
the kinds of collective security

211
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,759
mechanisms that we've been trying to get

212
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,400
globally in terms of protection for both

213
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,560
security and privacy so when you see um

214
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,639
states that cast a very long shadow

215
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,240
across the internet in terms of their um

216
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
policy setting the fact that there is an

217
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,599
australian act that will allow

218
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,120
authorities not just to um

219
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,639
be able to

220
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,759
attack

221
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,000
you know when necessary to do targeted

222
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
operations but also force cooperation of

223
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,120
um

224
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,679
tech companies uh to do so many

225
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,200
additional things these are things that

226
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
i think we really need to kind of figure

227
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
out how we nip them in the bud the same

228
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,679
thing the idea that we would create

229
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,839
splinter nets or separate economies

230
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,720
where you have a sort of national code

231
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,240
base if you will that doesn't

232
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,080
intermingle with anything that's foreign

233
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,920
because you're worried about some sort

234
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
of

235
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
globally initiated supply chain tax

236
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,959
we're setting up our own

237
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,480
barriers to success by doing this so i

238
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
really think that we need to think about

239
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,600
how do we

240
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,959
figure out

241
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,279
what is actually equitable for a longer

242
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,600
period of time and make sure

243
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,040
that even though we see these global

244
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,640
developments that we think locally about

245
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
how to ensure that they're not happening

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
in our own backyard and then try to

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
influence those global conditions by

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,480
moving every time from a local regional

249
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,800
to global perspective on a lot of these

250
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,399
things because they're really very

251
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,519
technical in nature

252
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
one example

253
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,399
when

254
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,440
the coveted pandemic hit we saw an

255
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,160
exponential rise in spyware and

256
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,600
stalkerware

257
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,680
and you know it's hard

258
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,760
to figure out who the heck is really

259
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
behind are these just formal commercial

260
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,440
companies or are we talking about total

261
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,120
state actors

262
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,519
uh all we are seeing is the permissions

263
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,760
that are asked by different pieces of

264
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,120
software

265
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,279
on our user base

266
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,160
and

267
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,480
when you take a look it's really really

268
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,680
difficult

269
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,160
to kind of differentiate

270
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,920
what the heck is happening why is it

271
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,480
happening now and what's different than

272
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,279
before and one of the worrisome trends

273
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,279
that we see is that there's a sort of

274
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,920
comparison between this line

275
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,640
and the increase in domestic violence

276
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,480
cases because we see that this kind of

277
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,560
stuff when it's used at a more

278
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
uh individual level

279
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,720
is really coupled with this type of

280
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,120
local abuse issue and when you take a

281
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,360
look at it at a larger

282
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,600
level and you zoom out again you see

283
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,440
that this type of excessive

284
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,680
permissioning is also used by like

285
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,519
covert tracing apps which were really

286
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,320
like the iranian corona tracing app

287
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,640
which was actually for us quite a shock

288
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,839
because it was a

289
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,399
state-oriented uh program but pretty

290
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,040
much to just track their citizens

291
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,000
so

292
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,079
also here you know we need to really

293
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,440
think about how on earth are we from an

294
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
os perspective from a mobile device

295
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,720
perspective

296
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,760
thinking about which permissions um

297
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,160
we would consider excessive and then

298
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,640
categorically ban them

299
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,600
this kind of spyware from the app stores

300
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
and we really need to kind of think

301
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,200
about is this okay at a global scale

302
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,279
starting at a local and national scale

303
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,640
and we also saw of course um and i'm

304
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,839
sure that in the security community

305
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,880
there's been

306
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,519
an exhaustive amount of attention paid

307
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,480
to this

308
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
but you know i i don't say this lightly

309
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,560
that we should stop things i'm not a big

310
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,360
fan of of censorship but i do think that

311
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,079
um stamping out evil and not looking the

312
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,320
other way is part of what we should be

313
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,720
doing as a security community

314
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,600
and when we see that there are

315
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,680
campaigns running to

316
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,720
target

317
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,279
from oppressive regimes

318
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,440
other countries other nation states and

319
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,360
that they very often have this spillover

320
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,240
effect to regular individuals and

321
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,079
businesses and

322
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,360
people who are journalists um or

323
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,320
uh from an opposition party that this is

324
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,720
not something that we should be allowing

325
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,639
free reign for

326
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,760
um and we really need to think about how

327
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,320
many of these types of tools would we

328
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,240
actually need

329
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,519
from any legitimate perspective so um

330
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,200
and to be fair i mean the pegasus uh

331
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,880
software is not the only one of its kind

332
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,839
there's a lot of different types of

333
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,079
spyware that would fall in this category

334
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,320
that are still commercially sold today

335
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,839
and we need to think about a smarter

336
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,839
regime not just one that's policy based

337
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,079
but also one that's technical to be able

338
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,399
to both detect and

339
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,360
block this type of activity

340
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,279
and whether that means signing the code

341
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,360
or having a trusted code base that gets

342
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,600
vetted and verified or automatically

343
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,040
called out

344
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,120
we need to figure that one out but we

345
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,639
really need to make sure that we detect

346
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,200
it in the first place

347
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,519
what you also see is that our need for

348
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,720
data isn't going anywhere um and

349
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,279
that everybody in any company that has

350
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,000
ever claimed that data is the new oil

351
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,160
uh has to reckon with the fact that if

352
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,440
that's the case

353
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,519
then data breaches are the new oil spill

354
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,959
they're messy

355
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,399
they're incredibly

356
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,959
hard to clean up and the long-term

357
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,040
effects of these data breaches is not

358
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,560
something that i think is still as yet

359
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,160
fully understood

360
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
just because users don't always know

361
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,440
contextually

362
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,639
where exactly uh that you know password

363
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,920
user combination was preached because

364
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,600
they're not using unique password uh

365
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,160
username combinations that they

366
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,399
don't necessarily always even if they

367
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,480
are subscribed to or have i been pawned

368
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,800
then um ubiquitously change everything

369
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,480
that may have been compromised with that

370
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,560
compromised set of credentials

371
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,480
and they're not we're very good actually

372
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,880
in making sure that there's um that

373
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,760
notice that's given to users is always

374
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,560
properly understood and then mitigated

375
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,800
after that data breach has been exposed

376
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,160
so really

377
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,920
this kind of cleanup is something that's

378
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,160
going to haunt us in the industry and

379
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,240
with our user base for a very long time

380
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,000
and

381
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,720
i suppose that it's part of the entire

382
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,199
trauma of the types of attacks that

383
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,199
we're facing that cleaning up and

384
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,680
recovering from them is incredibly

385
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,720
difficult

386
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,399
i also think that

387
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,760
we don't always understand how

388
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,880
very large complex scale attacks start

389
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,199
from very humble origins let's take

390
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,160
solarwinds part of the you know

391
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,000
worry that we had is yes we have a

392
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,279
backdoored

393
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,519
um software application that's used by a

394
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,600
very large uh

395
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,880
population

396
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,079
and that backdoor complex attack that

397
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,360
was engineered um by

398
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,240
russia that that was well attribution is

399
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,519
a should show but you know we assume

400
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,160
it's engineered by russia but that was

401
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,040
um

402
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,199
a foundational problem that was so

403
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,320
complex

404
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,600
that it was not easily um solved but

405
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,040
that's not true

406
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,199
and we saw after subsequent analysis

407
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,440
that there wasn't just uh for the

408
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,199
companies that were actually impacted by

409
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,880
this there wasn't just use of the back

410
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,600
door but there were also here again you

411
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,720
know spraying of praying of passwords uh

412
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,920
guessing passwords um there were also

413
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,320
easy mitigation mechanisms that could

414
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,720
have prevented anyone who did have the

415
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,240
backdoor software from actually

416
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,000
executing any kind of evil because even

417
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,160
if you got the update you didn't have to

418
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,560
have that server communicating back out

419
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,160
to the internet so if you had

420
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,440
appropriate firewall rules you could

421
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,720
have prevented that from happening as

422
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,000
well so really here it's um thinking

423
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,880
again about the basics you know how are

424
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,600
we protecting our networks from a very

425
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,800
foundational

426
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,759
uh segmentation hardening and

427
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,079
updating perspective and making sure

428
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,240
that we have you know secure credentials

429
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,320
and good authentication practice and the

430
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,839
usual stuff

431
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,279
so

432
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,800
we really need to figure out why is it

433
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,399
that these advanced attacks are starting

434
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,079
from these humble

435
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,120
origins and how do we get better at

436
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,759
fixing that

437
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,920
well you know there was this great

438
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,759
saying i think it was uh i'm not sure i

439
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,680
think it was at the bush election

440
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,880
campaign this is an age test um but uh

441
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,759
it was

442
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,399
you know it's the economy stupid and um

443
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,399
it's always about the economy just like

444
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,040
it's always been about the supply chain

445
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
and really it's always been about supply

446
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,360
chain interdependency uh the fact that

447
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,079
we're looking extensively at supply

448
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,959
chain attacks now is is good but the

449
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,720
problem has been there for a really long

450
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,800
time and we've been warning about it for

451
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,040
a really long time

452
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,959
bottom line is we all use the same stuff

453
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,959
all over the world it's not a great

454
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,880
reason though just try to make your own

455
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,399
thing just like it's not a great idea to

456
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,600
cook your own crypto because you're

457
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,199
afraid that everybody's using the same

458
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,280
crypto but some things are better with

459
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,199
the karakol principle that you think

460
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,039
that it's out there and it's better to

461
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,400
get attacked and that you know about the

462
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,919
vulnerabilities and you make an

463
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,319
iterative improvement every time

464
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,000
but when it comes to the supply chain

465
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,919
stuff you know we have been seeing

466
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,520
supply chain attacks what we need to

467
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,799
understand is a better uh lay of the

468
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,079
land if you will in terms of what is

469
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,559
the different code bases i have to think

470
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,480
back to an anecdote um i was at kpn when

471
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,240
we had heartbleed

472
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,679
and our biggest problem when heartbleed

473
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,000
happened was actually being able to

474
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,080
identify in which

475
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,280
vendor

476
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,480
products

477
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,360
the insecure uh cell libraries were

478
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,520
actually located we didn't know and when

479
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,760
we called the vendors they didn't know

480
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
so we weren't sure whether we could keep

481
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,840
our vpns up and running because our

482
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,600
vendors didn't know of the products that

483
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,440
were we were you know

484
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,600
creating the vpn service out of

485
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,120
didn't know whether they were

486
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,280
susceptible to heartbleed it took a i

487
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,520
think it was a 24-hour iteration before

488
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,160
we managed to figure that out ourselves

489
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,760
without their help

490
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,160
and another 48 hours before we had a

491
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,039
patch

492
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,400
but still

493
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,799
this is stuff that you know if you make

494
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,919
something

495
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,480
you need to know what you put in there

496
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,160
in order to understand if a

497
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,480
vulnerability has impact on your product

498
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,080
because if you don't do that as a

499
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,160
creator of something there is no way

500
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
down the food chain that somebody else

501
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,400
will be able to figure that out because

502
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,880
everyone is part of someone else's

503
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,600
supply chain upstream or downstream so

504
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,679
we need to do a better job of the part

505
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,520
of that supply chain that we control

506
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,360
either as a hardware vendor or a

507
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,039
software vendor or a creator of a

508
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,200
service we really need to understand

509
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
that because if we don't do that we

510
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,160
can't work on the bigger problem of

511
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,799
supply chain interdependencies

512
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,400
and this is a huge problem when it comes

513
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,160
to critical infrastructure

514
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,200
so if you have uh if you are a critical

515
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
infrastructure provider what you want to

516
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,760
kind of know is within your sector that

517
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,799
you're not all relying on that same tiny

518
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,440
component in every single uh piece of

519
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,919
architecture because if you are chances

520
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,240
are high that you know you get one you

521
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,160
actually have some sort of

522
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,400
nationally disruptive

523
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,640
scenario and then all hell breaks loose

524
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,799
and then you've got regulators dictating

525
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,240
which software and hardware you're going

526
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,080
to use so in order to avoid more drama

527
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,720
we need to figure out

528
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,320
what the hell is happening on supply

529
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,559
chain how is it constructed within our

530
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,120
sector and how do we have a better uh

531
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,720
understanding of underlying software

532
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,880
components and here you know i'm a big

533
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,799
fan of open source but here as well as

534
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,520
in proprietary it comes down to the same

535
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,679
foundational basics you need to

536
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,880
understand

537
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,720
what it is you're putting in your

538
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,559
networks just like you would want to

539
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,480
understand if you put

540
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,799
an ingredient of weird stuff in your

541
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,919
body you really need to do this better

542
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,880
so

543
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,360
for that effort i want to already say

544
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,919
thank you alan friedman um who moved

545
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,720
over from ntia to caesar and you saw a

546
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,240
cyber security

547
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,960
s-bomb that's going to be started i

548
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,440
think it's super important that we

549
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,840
actually make a software bill of

550
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,559
materials for those products that we are

551
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,799
super reliant on especially when it

552
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,120
comes to the really important stuff

553
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,799
especially when it comes to critical

554
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,280
infrastructure providers or folks that

555
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,720
are reliant on them or folks that are

556
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
providing to them you need to be able to

557
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,679
do this in order to have any like

558
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,080
long-term future of supply chain

559
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,080
assurance and everything else is kind of

560
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,840
meaningless unless we understand the

561
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,919
foundational ingredients and let me be

562
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,840
honest we're nowhere near

563
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,280
getting to a place where we're going to

564
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,120
say that we're done soon we're still

565
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,039
trying to figure out naming conventions

566
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,200
how do we identify these components so

567
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,480
we're still kind of at the beginning

568
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,400
this is good thing because we can also

569
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,200
then now determine how we actually get

570
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
it right the bigger the community that

571
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,280
starts off trying to think about these

572
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,440
problems the greater the chance that

573
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,280
that outcome will succeed so

574
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,080
heterogeneity now is good uh let's make

575
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,960
sure we we keep that up

576
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,039
and that i guess it's going to mean that

577
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,400
what we're going to see

578
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,200
because we're doing it in this fashion

579
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,640
is that it's going to be an evolution

580
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,520
not a revolution and that today it's

581
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,600
still like pretty much you know party

582
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,159
like it's 1999 in terms of

583
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,880
vendor stuff and vendor bugs and

584
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,440
everything else and you know um the

585
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,120
shift is still

586
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,600
yet to happen where we shift the burden

587
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,000
of proof from the vendor or rather from

588
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,720
the user to the vendor because right now

589
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,320
when we take a look at all of the things

590
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,640
that we buy and consume the burden of

591
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,799
proof is on the user

592
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,360
you have to update your stuff upgrade it

593
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,520
when you can buy a new thing you know

594
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,039
you have to make sure that you have all

595
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,240
of your stuff installed that you know

596
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,080
what's running on your papa

597
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,679
and i'm not saying that that is not the

598
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,960
case i'm not saying that you shouldn't

599
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,799
take a a bit of the responsibility i'm

600
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,240
just saying that right now the way that

601
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,559
we've architected it there is very

602
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,159
little responsibility placed at the door

603
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,080
of the vendor and i'd like to see more

604
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,159
happen in terms of hardware and software

605
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,280
vendors taking that responsibility i'm a

606
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,240
software vendor ceso myself and i really

607
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,760
believe that that

608
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,200
responsibility should be born at the

609
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,559
origin of the problem rather than at the

610
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,600
uh

611
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,520
last leg last mile of who you sell it to

612
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,200
um and i think we also need to figure

613
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,559
out that this

614
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,840
is not a problem that's going away

615
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
anytime soon because

616
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,919
you know all of this stuff uh is going

617
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,799
to be based on this idea that uh all of

618
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,480
this software and hardware is going to

619
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,039
require more and more user interaction

620
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,400
more and more telemetry gathering um and

621
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,760
that's going to happen to all of the

622
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,960
products in our home it's going to

623
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,039
happen to the things in our workplace

624
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,280
this is the evolution and it will not be

625
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,919
possible to turn this you know back or

626
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,000
put the genie back in the bottle so we

627
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,159
really need to figure out if this is a

628
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,320
shift to the vendor how do we protect

629
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,559
all of that user data that is going to

630
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,159
be gathered from all of these disparate

631
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,039
places and communicate with each other

632
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,520
how do we figure this out and make sure

633
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
that their current legislation which

634
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,280
favors the strong which favors the

635
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,480
vendor actually is also capable of in

636
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,600
the future

637
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,799
favoring

638
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,640
current population of the vulnerable the

639
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,600
users um and you know like the

640
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,000
vulnerable and not just every user but

641
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,320
what we see also at avast is that the

642
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,159
older the user is that more

643
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,480
disenfranchised and afraid they feel of

644
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
using all of this technology whether

645
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,080
it's software or hardware whatever

646
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,360
they're more worried about using the

647
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,080
internet about you know their

648
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,960
machines everything um and that this is

649
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,279
getting worse every year that we've done

650
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,720
our study

651
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,520
um

652
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,360
there is a call of course in europe to

653
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,640
try to get longer lifetime of support

654
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
for both software and hardware germany

655
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,919
is asking you know telephone

656
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,240
manufacturers to go a full seven years

657
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,400
of giving security updates and also

658
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,360
parts

659
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,720
for um

660
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,840
mobile equipment but this has yet to be

661
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,520
adopted because the eu is not asking for

662
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,159
seven years as of yet and you know it

663
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,159
needs to compile through the rest of

664
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,559
this ecosystem if you will uh in order

665
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,799
for it to really have impact so a couple

666
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,360
of things in the mix without making the

667
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,840
others also follow suit doesn't really

668
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
mean change for that vulnerable

669
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,279
population so

670
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,440
the legislation needs to think about the

671
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,840
weak as we go down the line

672
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,400
um indications are are good but you know

673
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,039
lobbies are strong um and if we really

674
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,799
want to see the change i hope that the

675
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,720
community can help make a positive

676
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,440
difference here

677
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,799
okay

678
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,720
i'm talking to you about stuff that you

679
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,039
guys think are kind of you know bread

680
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,520
and butter we know about this stuff but

681
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,480
um i'm worried about stuff that we kind

682
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,640
of see hitting us but that we don't want

683
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,720
to fully acknowledge because it's not

684
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,960
kind of urgent and bleeding and like

685
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,640
guts all over the place

686
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,880
and that's something that i think we're

687
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,919
not that great at doing in our

688
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:18,960
industry

689
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,440
but also on our planet

690
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,400
um

691
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,679
we need to be able to better prioritize

692
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,000
important things before they become

693
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,679
urgent bleeding

694
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,520
you know coronary heart patients on the

695
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,559
table

696
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,200
and one of those things is preparing

697
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,000
for

698
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,720
the eventual arrival of a quantum

699
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,640
computer

700
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,760
so i

701
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,120
see things happening um i i work in this

702
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,480
uh

703
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,320
project called the european flagship i'm

704
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,799
the vice chair and i see developments

705
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,279
happening that make me realize that you

706
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,039
know that time is getting closer and

707
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,760
closer that window is shortening rather

708
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,200
rapidly

709
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,880
in terms of what we need to do to get

710
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,240
ourselves prepped and part of that is

711
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,799
you know trying to figure out how we

712
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,400
come together

713
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,159
but the other half of that is just pure

714
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,000
awareness just everybody understanding

715
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,559
what the problem is so let me just do a

716
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,080
little bit of that explaining what the

717
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,200
problem is

718
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
all of our current cryptography relies

719
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,760
now on two difficult math problems that

720
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,919
is integer factorization and discrete

721
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,840
log integer factorization if you'll

722
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
remember from high school is basically

723
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,400
taking

724
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,120
a large number and then separating it to

725
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,039
its individual component parts

726
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,120
um it's hard to do it's basically

727
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,960
reversing a one-way function a one-way

728
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,480
function is something that's easy to do

729
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,720
in one direction but difficult to do in

730
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,760
the other so if i asked you what is 32

731
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,279
times 27 you might say oh it's 864. but

732
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,520
if i give you 864 it's not always easy

733
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,640
to say the factors of 864 that led to to

734
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,279
get there are 32 and 27 which is also

735
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,880
comprised of four a three and nine which

736
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,039
is also comprised of and so to list all

737
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,480
these individual factors is harder to

738
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,320
get than just a simple multiplication

739
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,480
that led you there in the first place

740
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,720
and um there is a guy

741
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
named peter shore

742
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,480
who basically figured out how to do this

743
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,600
reversal

744
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,080
um for the integer factorization then we

745
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,279
have uh grover who also not that grover

746
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,960
another grover figured out how to uh you

747
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,000
know

748
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,919
try multiple potential opportunities at

749
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,320
the same time in order to arrive at sort

750
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,840
of optimization

751
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
of the function and get the answer

752
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,720
quicker

753
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,919
um

754
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,760
and both of these combined actually will

755
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,840
rend our current cryptographic

756
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,919
algorithms that we use

757
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,840
um week

758
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,120
by the time that there is a quantum

759
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,039
computer that's able to run

760
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,880
uh shors algorithm

761
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,080
so we also have this fundamental issue

762
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,159
of everything that we've ever

763
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,520
transmitted

764
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,760
has potentially been captured and when

765
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,919
there is a quantum computer

766
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,240
that is available it'll be able to

767
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,520
decrypt that and then still render our

768
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,200
secrets our old ones albeit moot because

769
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,760
you know there's a predictive force of

770
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,679
old secrets sometimes being just as good

771
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,480
as new ones because you kind of know hey

772
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,279
this is the size of the

773
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,399
uh launch code uh key or something else

774
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,720
so i really think it's important that we

775
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,039
understand that a lot of the stuff that

776
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,960
we've already transmitted that may have

777
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,120
been cryptographically secured is

778
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,279
already at risk we need to make sure

779
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,600
that we start now playing with this

780
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,960
stuff in order to figure out how we

781
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,520
prevent future risks from happening and

782
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,919
you know to go back of course we cannot

783
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,240
do this in isolation

784
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,279
we cannot apply good crypto or new

785
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,840
crypto unless we fix those basics that i

786
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,679
was talking about a few minutes ago so

787
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,399
without having secure hardware

788
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,600
damn good operating systems really like

789
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,080
re-examining that protocol stew that

790
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,640
we've created over the decades

791
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,720
and then still coding securely and

792
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,320
having secure applications only when

793
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,559
we've got all that foundational stuff

794
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,440
can we apply good new crypto and hope

795
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,159
still you know that it will work even

796
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,159
with a reasonably advanced well-funded

797
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,120
attack

798
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,559
because they're not going to attack the

799
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,000
crypto they're going to attack one of

800
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,320
the weaker layers underneath so we still

801
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,559
need to get all of that stuff right even

802
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,159
when we want to apply a crypto that you

803
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,360
know is a basic but it's not optional we

804
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,760
can't just jump to the crypto and ignore

805
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
all the other stuff so i'm not

806
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
suggesting that i'm just suggesting that

807
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,000
we don't forget this problem in light of

808
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,799
the volume of work that we already have

809
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,880
on our plate

810
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,799
so if you take a look at you know when

811
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,080
it's going to happen well it's going to

812
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,679
happen when we have a quantum computer

813
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,919
that's big enough to take a problem that

814
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,760
would take you know like kind of

815
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,559
lifetime of universe uh to fit to

816
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,159
calculate down to a couple of seconds so

817
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,880
uh that depends on you know the size of

818
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
the qubits we've got on our quantum

819
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,240
systems

820
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,760
uh and when

821
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,480
someone actually like will make it

822
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,760
available

823
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,399
to an adversary that's when we've got an

824
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,279
issue

825
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,600
but to kind of bring it back down to

826
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,840
impact uh pretty much you know

827
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,000
everything we have now is somehow

828
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,679
impacted

829
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,919
we have things like rsa that are just no

830
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,840
longer secure and we've got a real

831
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,799
problem

832
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,679
but we also know that you know

833
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,600
even things like aes that you still need

834
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,200
to have a larger key size you need to

835
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,679
use the full 256 bits if you want to do

836
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,679
this and there still may be some issues

837
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,799
with um key exchange so you still will

838
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,039
have to think about additional uh

839
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,080
factors even when using using aes

840
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,600
and in order to figure out well how the

841
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,480
hell how bad is it i i always like to

842
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,080
say you know and this is not the first

843
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,600
time i'm saying this but i'm saying this

844
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,799
because i think i need to say this as

845
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,799
often as possible that we need to first

846
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,720
figure out how long do we need to keep

847
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,399
our cryptography secure

848
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,640
uh if we have a requirement to keep

849
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,840
something safe and secure for

850
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,760
a decade or two well we already have a

851
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,640
problem

852
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,480
uh because you know we think that it's

853
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,240
gonna take about a decade before we have

854
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,640
a viable quantum computer that breaks

855
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,000
our secrets now think about some of the

856
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,399
genetic data that we have think about

857
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,000
some of the health data we have if we

858
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,679
just say health data we want to protect

859
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,760
for the lifetime of the persons whose

860
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,080
health data it is we already don't know

861
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,000
how to do that and if you think about

862
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,919
how we then need to transition we're not

863
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,799
great at transitioning to new

864
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,360
algorithms or new quantum safe systems

865
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,679
because like take the example of

866
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,919
protocols that we know that we need you

867
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,399
know we ran out of ipv4 addresses a long

868
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,360
time ago i don't see us all using ipv6

869
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,679
it's gonna take a while we're not good

870
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,320
at change especially not globally i mean

871
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,640
we also know about mobile algorithms

872
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,120
that are still completely broken and can

873
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,039
have like real-time decryption over the

874
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,120
year and even those things we don't

875
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,200
change all over the planet so

876
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,000
we've got to kind of work now in order

877
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,360
to be ready

878
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,600
even you know if it's if if the quantum

879
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,519
computer is available to it adversary

880
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,200
just before it's ubiquitously available

881
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,039
we kind of have to start now

882
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,600
so it would make sense for all of us to

883
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,960
kind of take this seriously so what do

884
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,039
we need to do we need to kind of look at

885
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,279
first and foremost you know nsa had the

886
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,679
suite b advice uh for everyone who is

887
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,519
delivering to the government of

888
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,880
increasing the key length of your

889
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,120
current crypto this is not too hard

890
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,799
we should all be able to do this we

891
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,159
should be able to look at what's the

892
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,760
crypto we use and increase the key

893
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,679
length the second thing is you know

894
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,720
there's all different types of

895
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,399
technologies one of them is called

896
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,640
quantum key distribution it's not like

897
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,159
something that can be used everywhere

898
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,320
because it's got a lot of limitations

899
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,240
uh and i'll explain those in a minute

900
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,000
and then thirdly like look at those new

901
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,519
set of algorithms that are also going to

902
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,840
be standardized by nist in the not too

903
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,320
near future

904
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,399
or in the near future i should say

905
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,480
and um if we take a look at what the

906
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,720
hell is this qkd thing well it's it's

907
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,279
really kind of uh simple alice wants to

908
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,960
talk to bob they're our friends we know

909
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,360
alice and bob and what they basically do

910
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,720
is they have a sort of fiber optic

911
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,880
channel in between them and they relay

912
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,960
uh some key material

913
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,279
actually already like well not really

914
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,279
key material but some configuration

915
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,960
material or a public classic

916
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,640
authenticated channel and then they can

917
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
submit their key material over this

918
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,200
secure quantum channel and prevent eve

919
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,960
the eavesdropper from listening in

920
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,200
because the attempt of eve to try to

921
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,640
figure out what's happening there would

922
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,559
actually disrupt that quantum channel in

923
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,640
the first place eve would cause the

924
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,679
noise

925
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,240
to kind of break the uh the signal

926
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,960
so how that really works is basically um

927
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
a set of polarizers uh and the

928
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,120
configuration of the polarizer is which

929
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,760
alice tells to bob so bob

930
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,200
alice says hey i'm gonna set up my uh

931
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,960
polarizers a certain way so that when

932
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,440
that a single particle of light a single

933
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,000
photon emitter goes through it

934
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
it will go through those polarizers

935
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,440
because i configured them correctly if

936
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,760
you configure them correctly you'll also

937
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,880
receive

938
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,599
that photon in the right way so alice

939
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,918
then you know sets this up tells bob

940
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,520
about it and then alice and bob have a

941
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,280
secure communications channel that's all

942
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,679
qkd here is establishing there are

943
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,760
limitations because this is all

944
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,839
happening over fiber fiber has distance

945
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,839
limitation so this is not great for the

946
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,918
scale of the internet in order for this

947
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,839
to work you need something called mdi

948
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,800
qkd which is

949
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
basically something that will extend the

950
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,079
distance of the qkd solution by having a

951
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,800
like a trusted node in between alice and

952
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,359
bob there's also uh potential for

953
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,040
creating repeaters

954
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,159
between um this this distance limitation

955
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,918
in order to have this kind of bounced

956
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,199
all over the place

957
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,359
um where the ultimate goal here

958
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,679
regardless of how you get there whether

959
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,359
this is all fiber connections or there

960
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,760
might be some space paid nodes or

961
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,000
quantum repeaters or other trusted nodes

962
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,160
or using quantum memory regardless of

963
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,920
how we get there this idea is to have

964
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,720
this new foundational layer which is not

965
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,640
to be confused with the classical

966
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,560
internet but a sort of quantum internet

967
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,359
a sort of transmission layer

968
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,200
which can be used to have a secure

969
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,680
network architecture again this does not

970
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,880
replace

971
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,680
the internet it is a layer

972
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,920
so i just want to be very clear about

973
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,400
that and a lot of this will also be used

974
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
to connect quantum

975
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,240
computers to each other so it'll be

976
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,720
fully quantum end to end

977
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,640
um and again we're not all getting

978
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,960
quantum computers as your new

979
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,040
workstation so

980
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,359
this has very specific scientific

981
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,680
applications that are going to expand

982
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,920
once the use case is due

983
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,920
um but when it comes to post quantum

984
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,599
cryptography

985
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,520
the hardest part

986
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,880
it's the same hard part that we have

987
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
when we try to do vulnerability

988
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,000
management it's trying to figure out

989
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,160
what the hell do i have in terms of

990
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,280
assets so here we've got to also start

991
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,839
with what are my cryptographic assets

992
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,839
where do we use cryptography as a

993
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,040
company as a service and you know try to

994
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,440
figure out what do i have now

995
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,280
what do i need to transition to and

996
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,000
what's the timeline in between you also

997
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,839
need to think about if you choose

998
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,160
something that you need to transition to

999
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,400
assume that the first

1000
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,880
bake of that is not gonna work that it's

1001
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,640
gonna break or that the algorithm is

1002
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,240
gonna suck or there's gonna be like

1003
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,720
another mathematical breaking of it so

1004
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,240
that you need to think about the name of

1005
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,960
the game is crypto agility

1006
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,440
um we like agile for lots of reasons but

1007
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,040
pretty much because it's got a

1008
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,200
darwinistic approach that you know only

1009
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,520
those that can change will survive and

1010
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,680
that's definitely true here

1011
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,000
so if you look for agility and

1012
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,480
opportunities to do that then you can

1013
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,400
say that even when there's a side

1014
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,560
channel attack a incorrect vendor

1015
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,960
implementation a weak algorithm that's

1016
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,240
proven

1017
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,599
to be weak

1018
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,040
you will be able to swap it for

1019
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,359
something else that will still work

1020
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,520
and make sure now that you're already

1021
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,839
thinking about that you know

1022
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,760
policy framework that you want to have

1023
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,000
for innovation areas where you know

1024
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,760
you're going to need strong cryptography

1025
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,040
in the future

1026
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,520
and already now make sure that that

1027
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,440
supply chain has got your back by

1028
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,800
engaging with those software and

1029
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,880
hardware vendors and put it in your

1030
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,000
supplier security annex try it out

1031
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,160
and start failing and screwing it all up

1032
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,640
earlier

1033
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,200
i'll let the police car drown me out um

1034
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,800
what i also should tell you is there's a

1035
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,359
whole bunch of uh applications that are

1036
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,880
already you know

1037
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,960
uh creating applications for all of this

1038
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,640
quantum stuff if you

1039
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,160
want to try it out there's a whole bunch

1040
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,000
of online resources for you from major

1041
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,480
companies like ibm

1042
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,960
and microsoft there's all stuff that

1043
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
allows you access now a lot of it is

1044
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,280
based on python so in terms of a coding

1045
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,119
perspective it should totally be

1046
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,040
doable and there's different

1047
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,720
applications of your expertise that will

1048
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,400
let you build things for secure

1049
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,839
communications which we just talked

1050
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,280
about or even

1051
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,800
different applications like quantum

1052
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,920
sensors or you know working on quantum

1053
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,640
computing applications on the ibm

1054
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,480
uh quantum cloud uh machine so there's a

1055
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,560
lot of stuff to play with i just would

1056
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
like to encourage you all to get your

1057
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,119
feet wet and play because it will make a

1058
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,280
difference

1059
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,160
so

1060
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,160
zooming back out a bit when i tell you

1061
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,599
about all of this stuff and all of the

1062
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,359
work that we still have to do i think

1063
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,200
there is something that is pretty clear

1064
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,400
we are

1065
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,880
just a little bit broken um across our

1066
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,839
space from where we started like

1067
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,599
building our networks and our systems

1068
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,720
originally

1069
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,040
but you know i i really like this thing

1070
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,560
that i um

1071
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,240
saw the first time in japan called

1072
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,040
kinsuge and it's this idea that broken

1073
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,640
things have a certain amount of beauty

1074
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,480
and they can be fixed sometimes better

1075
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,040
than they were before so it's an

1076
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,359
opportunity to be optimistic and not

1077
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,040
pessimistic about all of the stuff that

1078
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,480
we still have to do

1079
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,400
so if we apply this like consugi

1080
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,040
principle then you know i i think it

1081
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
that opportunity means that like we look

1082
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,520
at it and zoom out again there's three

1083
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,000
things that we all kind of need to do

1084
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,520
first thing that we need to do is agree

1085
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,599
on what is it that we need to fix

1086
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,760
also within a company so every company

1087
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,880
on earth

1088
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,640
kind of needs these three things they

1089
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,800
need to understand what the hell is the

1090
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,119
problem and how do i fix it and

1091
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,520
specifically look at them cells as a

1092
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
company and then also look at the roles

1093
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,720
of the people that are in that company

1094
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,720
and think about our approach to security

1095
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,079
that includes

1096
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,880
that individuality of the company and of

1097
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,720
the roles and really has a sort of

1098
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,200
custom tailored approach for examining

1099
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,760
security from that perspective

1100
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,119
if we did that

1101
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,119
then we need to be able to see how it's

1102
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,960
going with visibility and risk

1103
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,720
intelligence we need to be able to see

1104
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,640
all of the stuff you know everyone who's

1105
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,000
ever dealt with an incident will tell

1106
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,480
you god i wish i had those logs or i

1107
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,680
wish i could see that part of the

1108
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,359
network or how come i didn't install

1109
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,119
that in my cloud instance and i do have

1110
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,640
on my on-prem stuff so visibility

1111
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,119
is super important but even more

1112
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,640
important than just being able to see

1113
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,160
all the things is to be able to make a

1114
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,400
choice about what's important and right

1115
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,960
now very often we tend to drown in a lot

1116
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,440
of noise and a lot of data in our seams

1117
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,160
and our socks it's a bit of a mess so

1118
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,720
really making appropriate distinction

1119
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,079
and you know mitre attack is a great

1120
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,920
place to start for all of that stuff and

1121
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,160
then writing custom detections based on

1122
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,640
miter awesome sauce so really thinking

1123
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,400
about how do we get that visibility and

1124
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,520
risk intel model put through our

1125
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,760
security teams and our

1126
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,240
tools is super important and then

1127
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,920
finally if we've got that if we know

1128
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,240
what we need to fix from like a human

1129
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,160
perspective and uh organizational

1130
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,400
perspective and we know how it's going

1131
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,800
from a sort of

1132
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,160
visibility perspective and a risk

1133
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,520
perspective then we need to be able to

1134
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,880
act and that means investing in the

1135
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,480
entire bloody company

1136
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,400
not just a couple of security folk but

1137
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,839
investing in the entire company that

1138
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,440
they have the appropriate security

1139
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,920
capabilities in place so awareness

1140
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,520
visibility and risk intel security

1141
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,720
capability

1142
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,640
we know what this is we just need to

1143
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,480
kind of figure out how to translate that

1144
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,160
into a sort of plan

1145
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,079
and you know i love that saying those

1146
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,520
who uh fail to plan plan to fail

1147
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,400
so

1148
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,440
i try to make a strategy plan for like

1149
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,119
three years and then kind of wheel it

1150
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,599
down every year so we got these three

1151
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,760
things right so we know what's up and

1152
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,920
what's broken and what we need to do we

1153
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,839
know uh what's going on and we can

1154
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,079
anticipate that globally then we can

1155
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,760
have plans for three years to kind of

1156
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,200
fix stuff

1157
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
so i'm just showing you a sample of a

1158
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,640
plan that i made

1159
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,839
and um

1160
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,760
we need to then think about how do we

1161
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,000
get this further right and that yes i

1162
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,599
put in ai for security operations

1163
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,440
because i do think we need it because

1164
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,040
dying in all that data we need to be

1165
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,440
able to make smarter choices what i did

1166
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,520
is i got i always get inspired by by

1167
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,240
owasp and i'm always loving the top ten

1168
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,280
so what i did every year of the three

1169
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,440
year plan is i made a

1170
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,480
top ten so if this is the big chunky

1171
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,200
blobs of work then let's split it to

1172
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,760
what are the must-haves for every year

1173
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,920
and you know what an organization even a

1174
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,240
security organization can digest 10

1175
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,400
things to do we can't digest 100 things

1176
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,720
to do but 10 things we can just kind of

1177
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,160
barely get there

1178
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,160
and even then you need to retain focus

1179
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,800
and still figure it out but

1180
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,640
and still make sure that the motivation

1181
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,400
is clear and change stuff if it's not

1182
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,079
working it's fine

1183
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,400
but you know having the top 10 makes

1184
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,359
things

1185
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,880
accomplishable

1186
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,760
also in terms of budget and appetite and

1187
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,079
focus of your it organization and the

1188
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,880
rest of your company

1189
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,599
also really important security is very

1190
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,760
often seen as the pain in the ass

1191
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,079
expensive bullshitty thing that i need

1192
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,640
to do because some compliance jerk

1193
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,079
making me do it

1194
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,560
it's rarely the thing that shows you the

1195
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,400
value of what it's bringing to the

1196
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,200
enterprise and what we tried to do when

1197
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,720
i was still over at kpn and i'm

1198
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,560
borrowing this from my work when i was

1199
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,440
there

1200
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,599
was we tried to make a dashboard where

1201
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,720
you could see and this is just one

1202
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,160
dashboard i had one for every single

1203
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,079
team where we did something called the

1204
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,240
fosie and the fosi numbers potential

1205
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,119
harm

1206
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,440
of security incidents that left

1207
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,280
unchecked would have meant an exposure

1208
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,520
to the business it's just money it's a

1209
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,119
number of money

1210
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,440
and we did this like financial figure on

1211
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,800
every single one of our things it took

1212
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,240
about 30 seconds by the way just so

1213
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,640
we're clear it's an estimation which was

1214
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,480
approved by finance about how we

1215
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,400
calculate the risk per incident for

1216
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,240
vulnerability and we'd make sure that

1217
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,760
the red team had it for all of loan

1218
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,119
abilities and we made sure that we could

1219
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,280
have a lump sum on it for the stuff that

1220
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,960
we found in other places and then we

1221
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,640
made sure we had it for all of the

1222
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,880
incidents so before a ticket was closed

1223
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,359
we calculated this fosi number it's all

1224
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,440
available online it's all open source

1225
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,920
you can get the kpn app it's also

1226
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,319
available open source so just in the app

1227
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,640
store no permissions required

1228
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,800
um and we just tried to make it

1229
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,599
financially understandable so you got

1230
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,800
this idea of not being on this stupid

1231
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,640
roller coaster that we're always on it's

1232
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,640
the information security industry where

1233
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,480
you wait for a breach to happen you ride

1234
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,000
the roller coaster up because you're

1235
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,839
getting all this attention and budget

1236
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,160
and people want to give you ftes and

1237
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,800
awesome sauce and then you ride it until

1238
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,480
you get to a certain plateau when

1239
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,240
pitbull are like wait a minute you have

1240
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,599
a lot of fte and a lot of budget and hmm

1241
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,119
i don't know i've got other priorities

1242
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,359
now because i need this time to market

1243
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,960
crazy application that's going to beat

1244
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,880
the you know socks off the competitors

1245
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,040
so then you lose you start going down

1246
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,480
the bloody rollercoaster and you have to

1247
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,040
wait for the next hack

1248
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,040
to kind of ride up again that's pain in

1249
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,359
the butt if you consistently demonstrate

1250
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,640
your value

1251
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,800
you don't have to write it down

1252
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,920
so we need to get off the roller coaster

1253
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,880
less drama and get on to a sustainable

1254
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,200
way to fix the problems that we already

1255
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,800
know about

1256
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,480
that's not just

1257
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,480
organizationally or locally or

1258
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,839
nationally that's also

1259
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,040
internationally the fact of the matter

1260
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,280
is no matter how well we do our jobs

1261
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,640
especially if we work in any type of

1262
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,440
critical intra or a company that is of

1263
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,280
fundamental importance in that supply

1264
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,880
chain you know someone's going to be

1265
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,800
trying to plot against you

1266
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,880
uh from a zero-day perspective or

1267
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,400
use you to

1268
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,720
be able to compromise your customers or

1269
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,079
others

1270
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,079
so it's really important to think about

1271
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,079
what kind of rules of engagement do we

1272
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,920
want to be a part of you know there's

1273
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,920
the talent manual that specifically says

1274
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,440
don't attack civilian targets it's

1275
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,640
talking about like sort of geneva

1276
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,760
convention

1277
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,000
um for uh

1278
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,720
what we do but i think that we need to

1279
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,240
think about this even broader and there

1280
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,560
are opportunities now to engage

1281
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,040
so we know that russia wants to have a

1282
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,359
new uh united nations cybercrime

1283
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,720
resolution this is a cause for concern

1284
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,119
and we need to engage now with our

1285
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,400
different groups that we're all a member

1286
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,000
of whether it's a cyber threat alliance

1287
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,920
or the cyber tech accord or somewhere

1288
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,680
else that you and your organization are

1289
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,359
part of engage now to make sure that we

1290
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,920
are you know trying our best to set

1291
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,319
those rules of engagement about what is

1292
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,079
okay and not okay to attack from an

1293
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,200
espionage or another type of perspective

1294
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,760
and make it clear that you know there

1295
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,839
are certain things that must always be

1296
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,400
respected

1297
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,960
and about that

1298
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,400
um i

1299
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,119
really believe in this idea and that's i

1300
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,280
think foundational also to owasp that

1301
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,280
you need to get you know

1302
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,599
80 of the benefit by doing 20 of the

1303
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,960
effort and we need to kind of have that

1304
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,119
consistently across the board

1305
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,520
that is really about getting the basics

1306
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,400
right if we get the basics right those

1307
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,480
simple things that we can do will stop

1308
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,440
those advanced attacks they will stop

1309
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,760
the majority of them in any case of

1310
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,839
course there will be a dedicated

1311
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,560
adversary that will invest in a zero day

1312
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,240
but that is not the majority when we

1313
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,319
take a look at the types of attacks that

1314
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,960
we're seeing at avast um you know there

1315
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,240
are of course there's every once in a

1316
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,720
while uh really cool stuff like where we

1317
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,280
saw a dll side loading attack happening

1318
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,520
in southeast asia uh which i have to

1319
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,880
tell you from my threat until team was

1320
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,079
just awesome

1321
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,400
um that they found this kind of stuff

1322
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,319
but it's also about the fact that we're

1323
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,920
still seeing compromise credits being

1324
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,480
used we're still seeing like really

1325
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,640
silly things fishing and

1326
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,920
they don't need to be there

1327
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,359
vulnerability is being exploited they

1328
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,200
don't need to be there so we need to get

1329
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,440
better at fixing our simple stuff

1330
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,040
and we also need to get better at

1331
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,200
thinking about how we organize

1332
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,359
also here you know i i'm always inspired

1333
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,839
by the country of israel

1334
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,880
um who has a 9-1-1 number for reporting

1335
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,160
vulnerabilities

1336
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,599
like wouldn't it be awesome if we all

1337
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,680
had a 9-1-1 number to report for

1338
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,800
vulnerabilities and someone actually

1339
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,079
understood what you were saying you know

1340
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,079
there is no internet police but thinking

1341
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,839
about having this place where you just

1342
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,079
limit the potential of the adversary to

1343
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,800
do attack by having a better defense

1344
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,119
this is the way we need to go we also

1345
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,359
need to make sure that the advertary

1346
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,880
doesn't have an opportunity that's

1347
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,520
presented to them by our own governments

1348
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,240
so any attempts to weaken cryptography

1349
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,200
or

1350
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,680
make it slightly uh less strong than it

1351
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,520
is is actually causing a bigger problem

1352
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,240
for all of us so we absolutely need to

1353
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,920
be on top of that to make sure it

1354
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,000
doesn't happen i know that we're always

1355
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,119
using the arguments of pedophiles and

1356
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,520
terrorists in order to do these kinds of

1357
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,680
things but really targeted operations

1358
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,599
would be my preference i mean also not

1359
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,839
great but better than weakening

1360
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,160
cryptography for all of us

1361
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,800
um you know so absolutely no ghost

1362
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,359
proposal uh kind of schema

1363
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,520
um and then finally like we need to make

1364
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,839
sure that like the nis ii the networking

1365
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,359
information security directive that's

1366
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,880
coming out of the eu

1367
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,880
does include that wider scope is

1368
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,559
actually able to have some teeth and

1369
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:09,920
does make sure

1370
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,240
that the entire ecosystem is protected

1371
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,480
through that supply chain rather than

1372
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,200
just parts of it which are consuming at

1373
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,079
the tail end of whatever it is that you

1374
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,880
know we need on the internet

1375
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,640
finally in order to get to our secure

1376
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,000
future we need to make sure that we're

1377
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,920
not launching the grenades of cyber

1378
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,920
warfare so all these calls that have

1379
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,280
happened since

1380
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,079
solarwinds and cassaya in order to do

1381
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,559
any type of hacking back is complete

1382
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,359
 we should call it out explain

1383
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,160
why it doesn't work because after all we

1384
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,559
really understand why hacking each other

1385
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,880
over the internet makes absolutely no

1386
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,079
sense and we should not like allow these

1387
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,839
kinds of regimes to be supported by our

1388
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,359
own governments

1389
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,280
um and of course you know we need to

1390
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,079
figure out a way to have a harmonized

1391
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,280
global economy and have this maintenance

1392
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,520
of strategic cooperation how do we

1393
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,680
actually figure out how to use products

1394
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,359
all over the planet yes

1395
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,680
but this you know walk softly and carry

1396
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,520
a big cyber stick and then smack

1397
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,280
everyone's every once in a while is not

1398
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,359
the way to go

1399
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,440
finally it's up to us

1400
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,960
so i'd like you to

1401
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,359
take whichever part you

1402
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,559
can play

1403
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,160
and play it

1404
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,399
thank you

1405
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:34,960
wow

1406
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,839
thank you so much that was fantastic

1407
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,520
um you did tell me before the session

1408
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,040
that you were going to be all over the

1409
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,960
show with all of the things

1410
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,559
um but i think you hit on a lot of

1411
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,680
things that i've heard a lot of

1412
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,599
conversations about uh this week at

1413
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,040
money 2020. um it's it's a lot of things

1414
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,559
that that

1415
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,079
a lot of the financial sector are very

1416
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,400
concerned about um

1417
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,319
it's it's stuff that is really playing

1418
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,839
on the minds of

1419
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,160
of people in in positions like your own

1420
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,839
like cso

1421
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:06,720
um

1422
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,440
we got a couple questions in so i'm

1423
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,720
going to go through them quickly we've

1424
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,240
got a couple of minutes

1425
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,119
um

1426
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,880
so probably from somebody who's reading

1427
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,280
your full have asked bio asked do you

1428
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,359
think the rising global inequity is

1429
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,400
driving an increase in cyber crime

1430
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,040
hell yes so if you take a look um i

1431
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,880
think it was just last week or this week

1432
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,520
where there are more chinese users

1433
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,640
online right now than americans and if

1434
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,079
you take a look at the total uh

1435
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,880
population distribution in percentages

1436
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,280
you know americans are the most

1437
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,480
connected

1438
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,720
um in terms of having access to the

1439
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,200
internet china is actually not the most

1440
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,280
but in absolute numbers they just

1441
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,119
exceeded the us population in total

1442
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,119
numbers so from a population

1443
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,960
distribution perspective the u.s is

1444
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,119
leading from an absolute number as china

1445
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,920
is leading and so the next billion users

1446
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,280
of the internet

1447
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,559
are all coming from you know asia all of

1448
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:03,359
them

1449
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,480
so it's insane but if you took take a

1450
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,839
look you know globally like who do you

1451
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,440
think is on the bottom of the list in

1452
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,040
terms of internet access it's not a big

1453
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,119
surprise it's north korea and that's in

1454
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,880
terms of population distribution kind of

1455
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,680
makes sense but also africa so i really

1456
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,760
applaud i i know i shouldn't but i

1457
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,520
really applaud i love starlink i love

1458
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,040
this idea of elon musk to give access to

1459
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,319
those that are the least connected and

1460
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,240
you know the ability to have these vsat

1461
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,920
terminals or whatever kind of small

1462
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,520
satellite terminals to have this

1463
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,880
connectivity is going to be huge

1464
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,359
advantage because they is the potential

1465
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,760
to leapfrog you know kind of like going

1466
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,400
from 2g directly to 6g kind of thing if

1467
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
we if you could there's still going to

1468
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,240
be a requirement for some terrestrial

1469
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,839
connectivity

1470
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,400
right but this this approach to get one

1471
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,000
world or starlink connectivity to africa

1472
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,920
and parts of south america it's going to

1473
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,599
be a game changer well i i'm i'm from

1474
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,119
south africa originally and i can tell

1475
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,559
you that at least with home internet

1476
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,359
connections we we went from uh dial-up

1477
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,280
on telephones to

1478
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,119
fire to the house right because we

1479
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,400
didn't have the infrastructure in place

1480
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,000
that intermediate stage and it was

1481
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,760
literally just leapfrogged

1482
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,200
but it does take an investment it's huge

1483
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,119
amount of time and effort money

1484
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,520
i worked in namibia we um

1485
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,280
we built this

1486
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,200
this network that was that actually did

1487
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,640
the same thing it went from copper to

1488
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,319
fiber yeah exactly

1489
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,640
um you're getting a lot of uh comments

1490
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,640
on on the vendor responsibility in the

1491
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,720
s-bomb in in the chat um and i'll let

1492
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,119
you pick up on a lot of those um there's

1493
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,559
quite a bit of traction in the channel

1494
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:41,440
there

1495
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,000
but as a vendor that offers software and

1496
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,680
not just any software it's security

1497
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,040
software

1498
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,079
um how do you advanced provide your

1499
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,319
s-bomb to whom you provided and under

1500
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,240
what circumstances like how does that

1501
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,440
work

1502
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,680
yeah these are really good questions and

1503
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,040
i actually don't have the answers to all

1504
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,800
of them so i think that this is the kind

1505
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,240
of work that we need to start doing and

1506
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,520
we don't we're at the face where we're

1507
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,280
still trying to define how do you name

1508
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,280
the components in your s bone you know

1509
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,440
just the name convention so how do we

1510
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,200
determine what the names are so i think

1511
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,960
we're really early days in terms of

1512
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,640
understanding the full process of who we

1513
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,640
provided to i do think though that

1514
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,640
there's a foundational aspect that if

1515
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,839
your

1516
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,079
customer is a consumer you know and

1517
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,319
that's the deal like avast is providing

1518
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,160
a consumer service

1519
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,400
so if your customer is the consumer just

1520
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,680
like the early days of when we had like

1521
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,040
uh privacy policies online they were

1522
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,880
indecipherable no one could read

1523
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,680
anyone's privacy policy so you need to

1524
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,839
take your s-bomb it still needs to be

1525
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,079
there and it's a full content but you

1526
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,839
need to make it understandable what type

1527
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,400
of risk it poses to users specifically

1528
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,000
when you have known vulnerabilities in

1529
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,319
components what's the point of s-bomb

1530
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,319
right it's only so that you know when

1531
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,200
 hits fan which part of you are

1532
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,440
responsible for

1533
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,640
well so

1534
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,559
that that i didn't know whether i should

1535
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:03,760
bring it up or not but i'm going to

1536
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,920
anyway um there are a lot of companies

1537
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,720
now uh security software companies

1538
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,319
uh appsec

1539
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,480
software companies that will provide

1540
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,040
s-bombs out of their of their tooling um

1541
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,480
and i'm gonna mention contrast here

1542
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,880
because jeff has been pushing for the

1543
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,400
you know the food label

1544
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,760
s-bomb

1545
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,160
forever um it's it's becoming a thing

1546
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,599
that a lot more people are talking about

1547
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,599
it's it's much more understandable it's

1548
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,960
easy to read it is easier to consume

1549
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,720
it possibly doesn't have the depth of

1550
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,400
data that the fda was asking for um

1551
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,920
but you know we'll we'll get there down

1552
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,400
the line right

1553
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,880
yeah i think we need both grant let me

1554
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,880
be clear i don't think it's optional i

1555
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,040
think you need both and i think it's

1556
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,440
this is about your ability to consume

1557
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,079
so it's not about either or it's about

1558
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,280
both

1559
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,480
absolutely

1560
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,480
and of course there is a cyclone dx

1561
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,400
which uh is an oauth project you should

1562
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,160
take a look at that if you're still

1563
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,760
new to working on s-bombs take a look at

1564
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,359
what they're doing and how how they

1565
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,760
their tool provides options so maybe

1566
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,040
it'll help it

1567
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,440
naming things is one of the hard things

1568
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,720
to do in

1569
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,960
in development so uh you know we

1570
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,720
understand that that's the problem i

1571
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,400
just want to do one quick call-out

1572
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,160
because i know you're gonna forget i'm

1573
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,480

1574
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,559
