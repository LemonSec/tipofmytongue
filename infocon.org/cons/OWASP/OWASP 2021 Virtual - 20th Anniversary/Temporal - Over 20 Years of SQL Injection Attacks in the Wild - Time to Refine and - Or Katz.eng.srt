2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,519
so yes that's the title of my

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,240
presentation but actually well i i think

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,320
i'm gonna do something very similar to

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,480
that which would be around some story

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,279
that i have and that story combines

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,320
um

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,199
elements of data and upset and

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,920
innovation and it's all tied to some

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,119
destiny my destiny in that sense so

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,599
let's try to do to move forward and and

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,280
well doing a short introduction to

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,800
myself i'll do that really quickly

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
former auspicious chapter lead i'm

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,680
really proud to doing that uh role and

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,559
and contributing to the ask community

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,320
i'm data driven security researcher

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,399
which means that i work a lot with data

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,879
and data drive a lot of my research uh

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,320
as uh as was mentioned i'm when i try to

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,480
define my role um as a security

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,520
researcher and there is a lot of

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
definition for that my definition is

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
that i'm trying to move security

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,600
security challenges into the science and

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,280
solution space hopefully doing that

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,840
correctly and last but not least

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,400
i have really boring uh social network

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,040
persona and therefore i don't encourage

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,520
any of you to follow me on twitter or

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,040
underscore cats

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,520
really boring don't do that

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,240
let's continue um so

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,640
where the story starts uh so the story

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,920
has some background and i will share

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,080
with you some of my background i used to

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,840
work in one of the

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,680
one of the first uh web application

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,799
firewall vendors uh a few well many

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,880
years back um the name of the vendor was

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,720
bridge security and my role in that in

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,920
that

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,560
company was to do all the security

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,079
research and maintain a lot of the web

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,159
application firewall rules that the

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,159
product had and and that was the time

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,880
that like you need to explain customers

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,240
what the difference between web

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
application firewall and ids ips why

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,600
they need web application firewall that

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,880
was the discussion that was the

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,560
narrative of the discussion

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
and part of that work of trying to

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,799
create those signatures and those rules

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,640
to protect against web application

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,680
firewall attacks uh well application for

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,439
well application attack was the fact

58
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,280
that you had to

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,080
in a sense try to create signatures and

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,640
rules that can enable protecting from a

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
variety of attacks but those attacks had

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,640
a lot of permutation for example we'll

63
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,520
talk about sql injection um in in this

64
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,560
presentation

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,400
when you talk about sql injection it's

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,239
based on sql language right and and

67
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,760
there's a lot of permutation of that

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,840
language and a lot of variant of

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,280
different sql

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,560
server and some of their syntax so you

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,920
have to make sure that you have all the

72
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,440
permutation and all the things that can

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,040
be done and that's a really challenging

74
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,120
kind of work right and that's a bit

75
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,040
background about me and my you know

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,239
where i started my infosec career now

77
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,959
the story actually start uh i would say

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,640
five years ago i think uh i was

79
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,200
traveling to san francisco and i was

80
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,680
supposed to stay in a hotel and i was

81
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
getting into the hotel lobby and i met a

82
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,360
colleague of mine and my colleague was

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,200
saying hey man you need to go to the

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,480
frequent user website of that hotel

85
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,080
because if you will do that and you will

86
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,000
register you will get a discount so i

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,760
was trying to do that i was getting into

88
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,840
that website i wrote my first name last

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,239
name and i got this answer right that's

90
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,440
the shock part um and and or are not

91
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,200
allowed as first and last name fields

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,080
right whoa so i'm not allowed to be

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,560
registered to that hotel and that really

94
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
shocked me and when i started thinking

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,360
about it i had a theory right and in my

96
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
theory was the fact that i was saying

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,599
hey maybe that's part of some

98
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,080
full protective detection kind of

99
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,640
mechanism they try to avoid the web

100
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
applications well replication attacks

101
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,879
right for example sql injection and the

102
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,959
keywords or which is my given name by

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,959
the way might be using the context of

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,959
when someone tried to inject a sql

105
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,879
injection try to create a logical

106
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,959
statement or inject logical statement

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,760
into the sql query now that was my

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,239
theory and and let me explain a bit

109
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,080
about sql injection i assume most of you

110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,439
if not all of you are familiar with that

111
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,879
but let's do touch base and make sure

112
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,560
that we are aligned so what's sql

113
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,879
injection right you have a query

114
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,159
select from a user where user id equal

115
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,120
to user id which is the actual value or

116
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,519
payload being delivered from the user

117
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,560
right now if you write really bad code

118
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,040
that given input will not be synthesized

119
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,360
correctly not be dealt with in a way

120
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,000
that will avoid sql injection and how

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
will injection would look like this is

122
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,560
an example of ejection someone will add

123
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
a value for the user id uh four or one

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,199
equal one once that get into the query

125
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,199
then again assuming that there is a

126
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,199
secret injection vulnerability out there

127
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,960
then you will get a statement that

128
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
regardless of the value that you will

129
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,880
put whether you put foo or something

130
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,080
else

131
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,360
the actual query will always be true and

132
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,280
that was in my mind the theory of

133
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,040
someone trying to avoid those kind of

134
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,440
attacks but then come the question right

135
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,759
but or by itself is it enough to create

136
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,560
sql injection the answer is no right it

137
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,639
doesn't supposed to be like that so i

138
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,520
was saying to myself okay let's try to

139
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,039
we'll prove that theory let's try to

140
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,360
figure out if i'm correct or not so i

141
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,919
was trying to add a different payload as

142
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,160
uh my username and this time

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,440
representing or is double pipe um

144
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,080
now why double type because in some sql

145
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,280
uh syntax well depends on the on the sql

146
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,840
server double pipe represent also or

147
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,880
right a conditional statement meaning or

148
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,800
and that was rejected as well right as

149
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,960
you can see the character pipe

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,800
greater than smaller are not allowed as

151
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,840
fields

152
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,160
so that was the denial part for me uh

153
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,320
right assuming that someone wrote those

154
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,479
kind of rules to that given web

155
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,800
application trying to protect it it's

156
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,560
blocking a lot of things just because

157
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,000
there is a portion or some part of

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,639
payload that might be used as sql

159
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,039
injection but it's not enough right you

160
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,360
you cannot execute sql injection with

161
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,759
just pipe or just the keyword or right

162
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,520
you need more than that

163
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,680
now moving forward i was saying to

164
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,880
telling myself okay so that sounds

165
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,319
interesting

166
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,160
let's try something else let's try to

167
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,600
put into

168
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,000
my username value something that

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,360
represent also a conditional logical

170
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,600
keyword and i was using the word sore

171
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,479
right exclusive or and once doing that i

172
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,720
was accepted so that was the anger part

173
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,880
right this is when i started to be angry

174
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,960
because someone is blocking or which is

175
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,600
me but sore my younger brother is being

176
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,199
accepted right that that's not

177
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,960
acceptable uh i don't have a younger

178
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,479
brother but let's say that i have one

179
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,840
and his name is

180
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,720
um so that got me mad and i tried to

181
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,639
funnel that kind of

182
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,800
anger into creating something uh

183
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
constructive and i wrote a short blog

184
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,039
about it and i explained and tell that

185
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,199
story hopefully in a funny way

186
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,000
and

187
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,919
that actually led me to a different kind

188
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,759
of thing right because few years

189
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,360
afterward after that you know

190
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,919
registration incident and the blog that

191
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,639
i wrote i was you know

192
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,560
acquiring new skills that in in the

193
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,280
context of data science and data mining

194
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
and and stuff related to that

195
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,800
and suddenly i asked myself maybe it's

196
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,479
time for destiny to knock on my door

197
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,840
maybe i should

198
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,479
utilize two things first of all my new

199
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,120
skill set and my ability to create uh to

200
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,880
work with data and create insight out of

201
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,199
the data using machine learning and data

202
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,280
science in that sense

203
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,800
and the second thing i was working for

204
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,400
arkham and i'm still working for akama

205
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,319
and the one thing that we definitely

206
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,039
have a lot of is data and was asking

207
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,199
myself maybe i can utilize the huge

208
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,520
amount of data that we have in acoma

209
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,000
that you know portion of data of the

210
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,840
internet and a lot of that data

211
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,000
represent attack vector how can i

212
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,160
utilize that in order to create a

213
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,960
process that will enable me to create

214
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,520
uh better rules right to create better

215
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,479
signature that will serve or

216
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,240
help with building web application

217
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,080
firewall signature that that's what my

218
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
that was my goal

219
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,919
and i call it rule them all and as you

220
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,360
can see it's like

221
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,440
there is a regular expression into that

222
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,160
uh and there is it's five step process

223
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,720
right five step for that first step uh

224
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,319
collecting and cleaning the data we will

225
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,479
use a huge amount of data we have to

226
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,120
collect the data in a way that will be

227
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,360
uh where we will be able to use the data

228
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,720
but we have to make sure that the data

229
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,479
is clean there is no

230
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,960
punctuation there is no garbage let's

231
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,639
call it like that into the date so we

232
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,000
will talk about that that's the first

233
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,640
step second step choose the keywords we

234
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,240
will use a huge amount of data and

235
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,919
therefore we will have a huge amount of

236
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,320
keywords that can be used and we need to

237
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,399
make sure that for

238
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,440
two reasons

239
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,160
the first reason from a com

240
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,200
computational point of view we need to

241
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,040
make sure that we have a limited amount

242
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,880
of keyword that we can use and the

243
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,240
second item is that there's a lot of

244
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,399
keywords that might not get in or

245
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,480
shouldn't be getting into the data that

246
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,279
i'm working on and that was uh um

247
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,600
ability to take them out of the data uh

248
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,519
so that's step number two step number

249
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,680
three uh we will create a matrix uh

250
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
which represents something for us to

251
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,839
work with because that matrix will

252
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,320
enable us to move to step number four

253
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
and in step number four we will create

254
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,640
relationship between different keywords

255
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,200
and how small similar they are what is

256
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,360
the similarity between those keywords

257
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
that will be step number four and once

258
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
we've done step number four we will move

259
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,200
to step number five which will be

260
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
clustering those keywords trying to

261
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,640
create some insights out of those

262
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,720
classrooms trying to make sure that

263
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
those keywords that appear together have

264
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,560
some meaning in that context and we

265
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,240
might have insight out of that and we'll

266
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
get to that phase later on

267
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,680
so let's get started we'll do that

268
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,839
really really quickly right um step

269
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,200
number one because we don't have a lot

270
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,440
of time uh step number one uh collecting

271
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,560
the data so

272
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,880
in order to present that i use a case

273
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
study with seven taylor seven sql

274
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,519
injection tailors um

275
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,440
but as we will move forward we will see

276
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,519
some example of thing with much

277
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,000
larger scale and much more

278
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,720
payloads to be used uh so in those seven

279
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,600
q a seven keywords sorry seven payloads

280
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,839
what we can see well different payloads

281
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,480
um some of them relevant to some sql

282
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,760
syntax some relevant to other well it's

283
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,160
it's randomly was chosen right it's not

284
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,079
the issue here but what i want to show

285
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,399
you here is that i will do some process

286
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,079
of cleaning the data and what does that

287
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,120
mean for example we have um

288
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,440
payload number three which is wait wait

289
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,480
for delay with seven seconds and minus

290
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,320
minus that then which is a comment in

291
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,600
the in the context of sql um syntax

292
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,839
and when we talk about cleaning that

293
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,600
that means that we will remove some of

294
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,320
the punctuation we will take for example

295
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
the seven seconds that are being used in

296
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,040
that case for the wait for function it's

297
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,640
a phosphorus function as far as i

298
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,320
remember and being used mainly for blind

299
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,120
sql injection when someone tried to

300
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,240
penetrate into the sql query and run

301
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,640
some slipping to make sure that that

302
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,279
that the code was actually executed and

303
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,760
the fact that you were able to penetrate

304
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,880
into the sql context and you know run

305
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,360
that on the sql server and it could be

306
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,040
seven second it could be eight seconds

307
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,600
it could be also 20 seconds right it's

308
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
it's it can change that doesn't change

309
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
the meaning of the payload and therefore

310
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,079
we were doing some normalization of that

311
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,480
and putting a a placeholder called blind

312
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,720
sql uh time right that's the form for

313
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,399
that the minus minus at the end that's

314
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,240
another example of something that means

315
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,200
commenting in the context of sql so

316
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,680
therefore we put some sort of uh um

317
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,040
placeholder for that as well

318
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,839
representing enox is sql so that's an

319
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,519
example of cleaning the data and this is

320
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,600
the same seven payload that you see on

321
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,760
the top of the screen now being you know

322
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,320
cleaned and synthesized and ready to

323
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,519
work with

324
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,200
moving to the second step the second

325
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,959
step is as i mentioned before it's

326
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,720
trying to choose the keyword base or

327
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,480
their frequency

328
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,279
now why that's really important

329
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,200
in the context to reason for that first

330
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,880
of all we have limitation on the amount

331
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,560
of keyword that we can choose but more

332
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,320
to that as we will move forward we will

333
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,200
talk about the fact that some keywords

334
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,279
with higher frequency

335
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,000
might lead us to do some changes in the

336
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
way that we write our signature or

337
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,839
reorder the signature that we are

338
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,120
writing because highly frequent keyword

339
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,040
uh assume relevant

340
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,800
um

341
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,880
means that we would like to match that

342
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,560
keyword before other keywords that are

343
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,720
not as frequent and is not as relevant

344
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,639
because that might improve some of our

345
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,360
performance from signature engine point

346
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,279
and we'll talk about that later on so

347
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,120
you can see i took all the keywords and

348
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,720
created some sort of a frequency for

349
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,040
those keywords moving to step number

350
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
three what we were doing is the matrix

351
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,279
right uh keanu reeve star but without

352
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,600
piano uh so the matrix is the following

353
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,040
what you can see here there are seven

354
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,240
lines

355
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,320
representing seven different payload

356
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,839
and in the columns you can see the

357
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,079
different keywords that we chose

358
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,880
and on each line you can actually see

359
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,639
whether a given

360
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,880
well where the given keyword appeared on

361
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,320
a given tailor

362
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,920
um so for

363
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,240
before moving to the next one so what we

364
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
would do the next step for that we will

365
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,320
do transport for the same

366
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,560
metrics right the same thing with doing

367
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,320
some transport for that

368
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,200
now the rows are the keywords and the

369
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
columns are actually the payload and why

370
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,440
that's important because now we have the

371
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,399
ability to look on for example a couple

372
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,040
of keywords select from right uh both

373
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,160
from you know sql syntax uh keywords

374
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,920
that obviously

375
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,839
we are familiar with and now we can

376
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,839
start to see some relationship between

377
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,560
them because what we can see here is

378
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,680
that

379
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,240
select and from appears together on

380
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,199
payload number two three five and seven

381
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,120
right that's a good thing that means

382
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,800
that they come together that creates

383
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,199
some sort of a relationship between them

384
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,600
but we can also see that payload select

385
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,920
well the keyword select appear on on

386
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,399
payload number six but didn't appear on

387
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,959
that but well and form didn't appear on

388
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,920
the on the same payload right

389
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,760
which means there is a similarity but

390
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,839
it's not perfect sometimes select appear

391
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,120
without the from

392
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,880
it could happen

393
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,839
how can we use that what is that what is

394
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,680
the purpose of that the purpose of that

395
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,920
is that the next step which is which was

396
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,160
to create a relationship between those

397
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,959
keywords we use the jaccard index

398
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,160
algorithm to represent a relationship a

399
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,399
numeric relationship between two vectors

400
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,959
what we saw before is vectors the the

401
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,000
calculation of jakar index is the

402
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,440
union of uh sorry the intersection of

403
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,600
two vectors divided by the union of

404
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,279
those two vectors and let me explain

405
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,519
that briefly right again the select and

406
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,079
for from example what you can see here

407
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,079
as we mentioned before select and from

408
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,320
appears together that the intersection

409
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,120
on payload number two three five and

410
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,880
seven and therefore the well

411
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,720
therefore there are four values of that

412
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
but we know that when we do union of

413
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,959
them we have five because we also pay

414
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,680
payloads number six with only select

415
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,000
now we take and abstract one of that

416
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,920
value because we want to normalize that

417
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
and create a value between zero to one

418
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,639
and we get the value 0.2

419
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,720
now what we can see here now that we

420
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,360
have a numeric value between zero to one

421
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
representing the similarity or the

422
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,600
thanks between two keywords

423
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,279
as closer as that value is to zero

424
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
that means that the strength

425
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
they are much stronger they are much

426
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,199
more similar in that context right

427
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,000
so

428
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,519
that's what we see here that's an

429
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,759
example for that moving into the fifth

430
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,440
step where we're doing clustering in our

431
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,680
case we're using hierarchical clustering

432
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,519
we start to see some of those clustering

433
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,279
again this is a case study that's an

434
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,360
example and what we can see here for

435
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,839
example that select from were clustered

436
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,160
together regarding the algorithm and the

437
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,880
score of the clustering was 0.2

438
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
now that's not all we can also see that

439
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,160
union joined that cluster later on and

440
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,399
that actually changed the score of that

441
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,519
cluster to 0.4 the number represents the

442
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,839
strength of those keywords appearing

443
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,199
together and that number might use later

444
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,959
on for us to decide whether we want to

445
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,639
use the relationship between these

446
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,800
keywords or not it might be that the

447
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,440
value of that clustering is

448
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,519
way too high therefore the relationship

449
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,600
is not that strong but if the value is

450
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,920
really really low it's close to zero

451
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
that means that they are really really

452
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,160
similar appears together and therefore

453
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,199
we can use that for other purposes

454
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,759
now we did that now moving to the next

455
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,759
step right as i mentioned before that

456
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,759
was just an example now let's go to the

457
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,920
real world example in order to do that

458
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,920
we were using a clustering of over 500

459
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,880
000

460
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,959
unique sql injection payload i would say

461
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,000
that again

462
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,720
500 000 unique sql injection payloads

463
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,639
it's a huge amount of data right and

464
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,400
what we were able to see as part of that

465
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
is that we started to see some things

466
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,720
that were interesting interesting for us

467
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,400
the the first thing that we're able to

468
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,119
see is that our intuition really works

469
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,799
and what does that mean

470
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,119
for example we saw the beginning of the

471
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,280
presentation the wait for delay wait for

472
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,439
delay are two functions that works

473
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,079
together they cannot be separated it's a

474
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,240
joint functionality in that sense

475
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,760
and therefore we were able to see as

476
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,600
part of the data that we were analyzing

477
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,280
that the weights wait for delay are

478
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
actually always or almost always appear

479
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,400
together if they are not appearing

480
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,240
together that uh uh

481
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,520
it's a mistake

482
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,679
uh and that gave us an indication that

483
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,160
our intuition worked as expected we saw

484
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,400
other examples for

485
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,679
for example uh then else and which are

486
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,400
um uh conditional statement being used

487
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,799
in sql um

488
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,000
and that gave us the

489
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,520
the good indication that we are on the

490
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,600
right track we're doing the right thing

491
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,360
the second interesting thing that comes

492
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,280
to mind when we look into the first and

493
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
initial graph that you see here

494
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,080
on screen was the fact that we started

495
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,559
to see some keywords that were not

496
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,039
associated with sql

497
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,280
syntax being coupled together and those

498
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,480
keywords were

499
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,799
for example name of columns and name of

500
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,919
tables

501
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,600
so what is the meaning of that and how

502
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,559
that's usable so try to imagine that

503
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,000
someone is executing some widespread

504
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,919
sql injection attack on some

505
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,400
vulnerability on wordpress right

506
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,039
and that given wordpress um

507
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,760
plugin that is being you know vulnerable

508
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,559
has in the background some database and

509
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,559
that database has

510
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,640
tables and has some columns and when

511
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
someone tried to exploit that it was

512
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,480
using those values and those values are

513
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,880
unique to that given database

514
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,280
but once they appear a lot as part of

515
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
the process that we were running as part

516
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,799
of the analysis that we were doing we

517
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,720
started to see those coupling comes

518
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,679
together

519
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,919
and that gave us the ability to put some

520
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,559
spotlight on things that we were never

521
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,480
um um being aware of that being executed

522
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,320
out there so it's in a way gave us the

523
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,240
ability to start to see some campaign

524
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,960
some sql injection campaign abusing some

525
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,360
vulnerabilities and it lead us to do

526
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
some priorities of dealing with those

527
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,640
kind of attacks and trying to figure out

528
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,400
if we have the better

529
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,720
if those applicants are really protected

530
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,280
or if those applications are actually

531
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
vulnerable is it a non-vulnerability is

532
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,559
a new vulnerability a zero-day

533
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,400
vulnerability that was part of some

534
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,679
things that we were able to see out

535
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,400
there

536
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,280
now here comes the part

537
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,360
that i was thinking very quickly and i

538
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,760
will start to speak a bit slower uh

539
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,120
which um you might ask yourself okay so

540
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,000
it's a nice project it's it's

541
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,760
it might be a nice product you might

542
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,120
think it's not

543
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,080
um

544
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,400
full disclaimer i'm i'm not considering

545
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,600
myself a data scientist um or machine

546
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,160
learning expert it's not what i

547
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,640
you know uh acknowledge myself as being

548
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,400
one um

549
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
and therefore if you think and if you

550
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,919
are data scientist and you think that

551
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,360
there are better ways to do what i was

552
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,440
doing you're probably right there are

553
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,840
so that's important to put that

554
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,520
into mind

555
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,360
but you might ask yourself okay so it's

556
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,200
a nice product what can we do with that

557
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,600
what's the implication of that

558
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,280
so few of those

559
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,240
again and bear in mind that my objective

560
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,480
was to try to create some research

561
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
project that might help those that write

562
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,320
signature because it's really really

563
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,720
manually processed really challenging

564
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,280
really complex in that sense

565
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
and if i will get some insight that will

566
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,400
help write those signature rules um

567
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,480
that might help in the context of making

568
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,640
those rules better and making the effort

569
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,120
of creating them much easier so few of

570
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,520
those things that can be used uh first

571
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,120
of all improve signature detection right

572
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,200
so once we are doing that and collecting

573
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,679
those keywords and again we don't know

574
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,840
the payload we just saw a bunch of

575
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,320
payload and we just processed them and

576
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,799
once we did that we were able to see

577
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,960
some keywords that were chosen and we

578
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,240
looked into those keywords and tried to

579
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,919
figure out if we had those keywords part

580
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,000
of our signature files right if we have

581
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,520
those as part of the signature that we

582
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
created for our application firewall and

583
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,960
if for example there is a keyword that

584
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,280
was not used as part of the signature

585
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,360
file map we might want to add them so

586
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,280
that was the first part the second part

587
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,640
here is that

588
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,039
it's a more important most important one

589
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,720
to the best of my knowledge

590
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,760
which is

591
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,360
concerning improving performance and

592
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,080
efficiency of signatures so two two use

593
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,240
case arrows here first of all frequency

594
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,559
of matching payload right so we saw the

595
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,720
fact that we saw some uh frequency of

596
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,960
the keywords that were used as part of

597
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,159
that of the

598
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,640
you know 500 thousand for example uh

599
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,400
payload that we're able to see out there

600
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,200
now if a given k word appears a lot in

601
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,039
high frequency as i mentioned before

602
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,440
maybe that should be matched before

603
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,919
others right and maybe that will effect

604
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,919
depends on the implementation of our

605
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,080
signature engine that might

606
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,720
affect the way we perform once we are

607
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,480
doing matching for those signatures so

608
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,720
that's the first case the second one

609
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,159
which is more interesting is the fact

610
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,000
that we started to see right coupling of

611
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,720
keyword and as strong as that

612
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,159
coupling and as strong as that

613
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,840
clustering between those keywords that

614
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,240
can lead us to say hey maybe we have the

615
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,480
ability to take those different keywords

616
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
that comes together and create signature

617
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,960
out of that a simple signature signature

618
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,440
does that that does not use regular

619
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,520
expression because they are appears to

620
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,000
get together they have some order and

621
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,840
they are really distinct and in that

622
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,760
sense if i create a signature that is

623
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,799
not as complex and it's not as

624
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,400
not highly efficient as regular

625
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,840
expression i might take some of my

626
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,080
regular expression and retire them and

627
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,600
replace them with simple patterns so

628
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,520
that was the second okay and the third

629
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,120
one is find new exposure and explain

630
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,880
about it on a previous slide which is

631
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,799
you know the the name of the columns and

632
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,400
the name of the tables and the coupling

633
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,159
in our ability to put some spotlight

634
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,919
into that so that those are the

635
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,080
implications that i was using and i was

636
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,200
um

637
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,240
um

638
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,600
well

639
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,600
presenting as part of my uh research now

640
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,120
we are at the end of the presentation

641
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,960
right we have five more minutes and

642
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
we'll give some minutes uh

643
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,440
for questioning if we have some um so

644
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,799
what what is the purpose of this

645
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,960
research right so obviously as i

646
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
mentioned i'm not as i'm not a data

647
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,320
science or

648
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,000
machine learning expert it's not the

649
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,559
issue here the issue for me was the fact

650
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,440
that

651
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,240
um our ability to take some problem that

652
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,840
we have in the past that created a lot

653
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,360
of challenges for us that we used to

654
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,440
solve in a manual way as we move forward

655
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,320
in the

656
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,000
uh technology stack we have new

657
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,840
capabilities when you have new ways and

658
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,720
we can use new innovation to create some

659
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,799
solutions to pla to try to solve those

660
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,799
old things that that's from from a

661
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,159
research point of view and that's you

662
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,400
know my state of mind and how i do some

663
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,480
of my uh research

664
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,200
um more to that um

665
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,960
so

666
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,279
the joke is on me right um

667
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,760
