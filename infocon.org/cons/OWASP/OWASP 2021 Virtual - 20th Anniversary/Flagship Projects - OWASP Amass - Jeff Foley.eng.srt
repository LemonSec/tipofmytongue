[Music]

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,360
other than maybe

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,280
uh this would be a good point to say

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,039
how did this uh get started or why

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,840
why did i do this

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,720
and

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,039
it was a little bit of where i came from

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,320
so

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,240
you know i've had a lot of experience

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,760
with

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,119
seeing how

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:31,920
much

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,320
security can be improved by looking at

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,280
it from the attacker's perspective

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,719
you know i i definitely believe

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,040
if you don't understand your adversary

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,320
you are going to have a lot of trouble

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,920
protecting against it and if you don't

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,120
know what you're protecting you will not

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,559
be able to protect it like if you don't

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,239
know it exists you're not not going to

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,760
be able to protect it

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,920
so

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,440
situational awareness is really

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,559
important

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,440
visibility is really important and

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,719
when i

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,119
needed more of this for myself uh

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,119
working with clients

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,439
it just this is about four years ago

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,280
actually uh next week

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,600
yeah this was a bit of a gap or

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,680
the capabilities were

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,520
lacking so

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,360
i created this a little bit for myself

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,640
initially and and the work i was doing

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,720
but then quickly felt

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
like we should uh contribute this to the

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,880
community

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,560
it took about a year after that for a

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,200
wasp to uh notice it and then

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,799
we made it an ole wasp project

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,840
so

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,079
what exactly is

45
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,680
the ems

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,240
project though

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,840
so

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,640
put simply or as simply as you can

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,479
describe it i think it's attack surface

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,560
mapping that's what this project has

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,159
always been about

52
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,680
it's about getting the most complete

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,799
picture

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,600
possible of an organization or a

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,840
namespaces attack surface on the

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,840
internet

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
so

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,520
specifically what this tool does is

59
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,480
it ingests information that's available

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,760
from the internet such as osint data

61
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,120
sources

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,200
and it does some

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,879
techniques you know implement some

64
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,040
techniques to then

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,680
continue investigating

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,280
uh

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,760
these exposed exposed assets

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,959
but then

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,040
it continues to make this information

70
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,239
say

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,480
more usable

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,680
by

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
implementing tracking features

74
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,920
which um

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,879
allow or it could be a user or an

76
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,760
organization to

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,000
answer questions like

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
okay we have you know thousands of

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
discovered assets

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
which ones are new

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,239
you know which ones have we

82
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
were we not aware of

83
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,400
you know these are

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,720
it's um

85
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,239
you know nobody wants to go through all

86
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,159
the data right that's what it boils down

87
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,560
to so tracking allows you to get quick

88
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,920
answers to those kinds of questions

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,799
we also have a visualization

90
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,239
so that if you are not just doing this

91
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,720
continuously and you know looking for

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
changes but it's actually a little bit

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,920
more of an investigative uh stage say of

94
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,280
your

95
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,720
your ocean work

96
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,480
then uh the visualization can be really

97
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,959
helpful because

98
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,040
it allows you to see

99
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
what other organizations the target

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,280
organization is

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
connected with

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,439
or what

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,640
networks the assets reside on and

104
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
therefore there could be maybe more

105
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,640
assets or more name spaces that you

106
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,480
weren't aware of

107
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,280
by

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,879
using the visualization i think it makes

109
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,640
it really easy to quickly spot those

110
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,519
things

111
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,400
and then expand the scope of your

112
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,120
enumerations

113
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,639
and then

114
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,120
last on here but definitely uh not least

115
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,759
this tool started out you know like many

116
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,720
things uh limited to you know what we

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,520
were

118
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
writing ourselves

119
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,359
but it's now extendable so

120
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,120
if if a user or an organization has its

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,840
own data sources

122
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,479
they can now roll that in to their use

123
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,400
of the amass project and we'll

124
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,919
we're going to touch on all these things

125
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,520
a little bit more

126
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,400
in the upcoming slides

127
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,280
so

128
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,800
really

129
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
this this all like i said happened about

130
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,479
four years ago and

131
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,720
it was around the same time when it

132
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
seemed like people were finally

133
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,400
recognizing that

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,280
this was an essential essential part of

135
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,440
a security program i mean

136
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
it for quite a while it seemed like

137
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,120
attack surface management was not

138
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,400
considered

139
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,520
a necessary part of a mature

140
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,880
security program

141
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,199
but as i said at the beginning uh if

142
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,639
you're missing this

143
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,479
information

144
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,080
you know you're going to have

145
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,039
trouble

146
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,000
making

147
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,199
some really important decisions

148
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,840
for instance

149
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,800
if you don't know what you look like to

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,240
a threat actor or an adversary

151
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,880
how do you answer the question of

152
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
which assets are most likely to be

153
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,919
attacked

154
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:54,800
or

155
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,319
do we have

156
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,160
the

157
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
assets that are

158
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,759
most likely to be attacked hardened to

159
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,280
the level that

160
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,000
you know we're comfortable with

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,479
what about um do we even know everything

162
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,000
that's exposed on the internet which

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,160
that perhaps that sounds

164
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
uh silly

165
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,000
but

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,160
i have yet to work with any company

167
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,479
uh where when that question

168
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,600
comes up that the answer was

169
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,880
they knew

170
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,960
everything that was exposed every single

171
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,560
company i've ever worked with

172
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,039
and helped them with this

173
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,960
we ended up discovering

174
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,199
many more assets that were publicly

175
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,479
reachable and they were not aware of it

176
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,440
so this is a very serious problem

177
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,360
um and a lot of it

178
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,560
as i say here it comes from

179
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,120
this ongoing issue of

180
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,560
asset inventory is rarely ever up to

181
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,080
date

182
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,120
with

183
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,440
what's actually deployed i mean it's

184
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,160
kind of that simple

185
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,599
and

186
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,520
that's why

187
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,280
you need attack surface management in

188
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,400
order to

189
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,720
make sure that you're staying on top of

190
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,639
not what you think

191
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,720
is deployed but what is actually

192
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,680
deployed

193
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,960
what's really

194
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,199
uh out there right now

195
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,039
you might you could kind of call it

196
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,039
what's in the what's

197
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,880
out in the field

198
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,680
versus you know what you hoped was

199
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,319
out in the field

200
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,639
as i said i mean i guess what i'm always

201
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,400
pinching myself

202
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
that

203
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,160
this doesn't seem a little bit more like

204
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,919
well of course right you when you're

205
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,160
listening to this perhaps you think

206
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,440
well yeah doesn't

207
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,000
wouldn't everyone look at it this way

208
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,840
but it's

209
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,280
this has not been a priority of um

210
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,720
for a lot of companies until the last

211
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,560
couple of years

212
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,879
and this project has attempted to help

213
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,599
that movement to

214
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,680
put the spotlight on the importance of

215
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,520
attack surface management

216
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,800
and

217
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,720
kind of lead the charge at least from

218
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
the open source community

219
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,319
um on how

220
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,479
important this really is

221
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,319
like i say here in the

222
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,560
subtitle

223
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,160
you can't protect something if you don't

224
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,879
know

225
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,560
that you have it out there right if you

226
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
don't know what's exposed if you don't

227
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,840
know it's been deployed

228
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,080
or you it's you know this has happened

229
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
and you weren't made aware of it

230
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
or the right teams weren't made aware of

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,760
it then

232
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,200
it could just be out there on its own so

233
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,519
to speak

234
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,680
like i mentioned earlier this happens

235
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,399
more than perhaps you would think

236
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,640
and it's just frankly i think

237
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
unacceptable

238
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,440
especially when there's ways we can deal

239
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,839
with this

240
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,880
so another focus of this project is

241
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,279
there's a lot of places where you can

242
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,160
get

243
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,120
data about what's on the internet

244
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,360
and there's a lot of ways that you can

245
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,279
attempt to enumerate what's on the

246
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,279
internet

247
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,800
amass currently

248
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,080
supports

249
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,440
70 or more different

250
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,680
data sources

251
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,399
out of the box so

252
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,760
it's quite a bit of uh work maintaining

253
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
all of these different data sources and

254
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,839
making sure that they're all

255
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,920
working correctly and we're taking full

256
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,440
advantage of them

257
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,920
uh when they make you know changes that

258
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,880
we're

259
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,080
uh updating the mass tools as well so

260
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
that we're continuing

261
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,240
you know to use these data sources

262
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,399
correctly

263
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,410
a lot of that has

264
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,040
[Music]

265
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,279
been made a little easier by

266
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,680
establishing uh better relationships

267
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
with the organizations that

268
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,640
own these data sources

269
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,880
but at the end of the day it really is

270
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,320
we have a lot of contributors on this

271
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
project and everyone is working hard to

272
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,279
try to keep

273
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,320
all of this up to date and add new data

274
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
sources as

275
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
were

276
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,800
as we learn of their existence

277
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,560
you know we definitely started off with

278
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,399
far fewer than 70

279
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,279
and

280
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,480
it's been a mixture of just hard work on

281
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,160
this project and a

282
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,800
strong community around this tool that

283
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,160
has

284
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,240
made it possible to expand it to what it

285
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,640
is today

286
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,360
uh like it says here

287
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,800
you could think of the data we're

288
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,360
getting from these data sources as a

289
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,680
trampoline stage of

290
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,000
the enumeration where you know we start

291
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,360
off with all this data we're getting

292
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,320
from

293
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,079
data you know these data sources or

294
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,440
services

295
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,880
and then

296
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,279
the tool continues to

297
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,560
investigate these name spaces and

298
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,880
uh the infrastructure in order to

299
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,760
attempt to reveal

300
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,240
more assets that perhaps the data

301
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,839
sources didn't know about

302
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,279
using all sorts of different techniques

303
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,519
like you know i listed i mentioned here

304
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,240
dns zone transfers

305
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,680
you know we have

306
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,440
zone walking we have uh pulling tls

307
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,800
certificates

308
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,640
crawling web pages there's all sorts of

309
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,200
things that have been implemented

310
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
that attempt to

311
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,320
glean additional

312
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,839
information about the target

313
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,519
organization's

314
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,959
name space and infrastructure

315
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,279
all right

316
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,360
moving along uh tracking again so

317
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,279
yeah this was um

318
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,320
this tool you know was quite powerful

319
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
when you know as we continue to expand

320
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,880
it

321
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,120
but it created this new problem which is

322
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,040
we had more data than we knew what to do

323
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,880
with right or most you know most users

324
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,959
were saying there's so much data and

325
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,720
they just want

326
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,360
um for instance what's been

327
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,480
removed what's been moved

328
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,519
and what's new right like these were the

329
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,360
changes that they wanted to be informed

330
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,800
about or informed of

331
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,519
otherwise it is like trying to find a

332
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,320
needle in a haystack

333
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,279
so these tracking capabilities

334
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,639
or features

335
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,480
um

336
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,120
are possible because a mask does not

337
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,360
just enumerate this information and then

338
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,880
print it out and

339
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,200
wash his hands and terminate

340
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,760
it's storing all this information in a

341
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,560
graph database

342
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,920
and

343
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,399
if you run your enumeration let's say

344
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,760
i mean it could be every day it could be

345
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,120
every week

346
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,040
it could be continuously whatever makes

347
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,800
sense for your

348
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,200
security program

349
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,920
it's storing every single enumeration in

350
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,720
the database and all that is available

351
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,440
to us and we can

352
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
you know look at what was

353
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,040
different from one enumeration to the

354
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,160
next

355
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,920
it also helps us

356
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,440
to make sure that everything we knew

357
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
previously is being

358
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,920
considered in the future enumeration so

359
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,240
that we get consistency across the

360
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,639
investigations or enumerations

361
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,959
so that it when we say something's

362
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,600
changed from one to the next

363
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
you know you can at least know and we

364
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,959
knew everything this time that we knew

365
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,518
previously

366
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,880
so if it if we didn't find it there's a

367
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,720
you know pretty high

368
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
percentage chance that that means it's

369
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,360
because of gone now

370
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,320
the uh

371
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,839
the other interesting things we can do

372
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,600
with this and you know i'll talk more

373
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,880
about this at the end

374
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,360
is that

375
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,480
there's other ways that there's other

376
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,680
questions you can answer other than

377
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,639
did we

378
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,279
lose assets or did they move or

379
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,360
or are they new

380
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,399
you can also answer questions such as

381
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,240
which assets

382
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,440
were known by the largest number of data

383
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,279
sources

384
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,760
or another way to look at that or

385
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,839
say that could be

386
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,839
which of these assets are most likely to

387
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,839
be discovered by an

388
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,040
adversary that could be a very

389
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,880
interesting question to answer i think

390
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,639
because it could help you prioritize

391
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,800
which would are most likely to become

392
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,240
targets

393
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,199
in a

394
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,680
say targeted campaign or

395
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,480
or just if someone's quickly doing this

396
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,399
type of activity

397
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,160
you know which of these are most likely

398
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,279
to show up on their radar

399
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,480
you could also for instance

400
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,000
use this source information to say well

401
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,399
we're going to pull in our own asset

402
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,800
inventory information to the mass

403
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,959
project or the mass tool

404
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,399
along with all the things that we're

405
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,800
learning from the internet and

406
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,399
we will compare

407
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,320
what was known from our in by our

408
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,519
inventory versus what we found out from

409
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,320
all the other sources the delta

410
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,680
could reveal

411
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,040
what our inventory isn't accounting for

412
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,480
and therefore places where we need to

413
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,800
update stale information

414
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,160
or just missing information

415
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,680
so

416
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,519
these are areas where we've attempted to

417
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,959
you know not simply enumerate what

418
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,480
is available but to reveal

419
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,360
where security um

420
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,079
programs have say gaps in in their own

421
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,759
intelligence or

422
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,000
information that they are working off of

423
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,800
i mean

424
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
asset inventory is really a

425
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,199
such a fundamental

426
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,160
uh capability right that all of it and

427
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,839
security and others

428
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,079
rely on

429
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,040
and

430
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,000
anything we could do to shed light on

431
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
where these same improvements need to be

432
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,959
made

433
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,160
i think

434
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,000
most people would agree is beneficial

435
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,360
and worth the cycles to make make the

436
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,839
changes

437
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,839
all right

438
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,079
so

439
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,480
what we have here

440
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,720
is

441
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,519
so a couple things personally i'm a very

442
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,160
visual uh person

443
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,000
i found it

444
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
uh early on in the life of this tool to

445
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,360
it was beneficial to have visualization

446
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,279
perhaps part of that too is that uh

447
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,199
prior to this tool existing you know i

448
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,920
was a big fan of multigo

449
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,959
i was used to this uh process say of

450
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,880
let's find the targets

451
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,600
and let's see what this looks like right

452
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,399
or see where they are

453
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,359
things like that so

454
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,119
when

455
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,720
this tool was created and we were able

456
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,039
to get even more information

457
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,880
it seemed even more important that we

458
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,160
were able to see it

459
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,039
but also uh i kind of

460
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,439
i'm i really believe in this uh quote

461
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,679
here that's underneath the title of this

462
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,599
slide

463
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,000
which is

464
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,960
again this is how attackers

465
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,280
look at your organization

466
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,039
if you're on the defender you know if

467
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,360
you're a defender

468
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,919
it's beneficial i think to

469
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,000
view your own organization the way the

470
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,840
threat actor will

471
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,520
in order for you to help to help you

472
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
understand what they're

473
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,600
likely to be thinking

474
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
when they're considering you as a target

475
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,360
so

476
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,080
this this can be good just to review if

477
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,799
you're on the blue side in order to

478
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,320
understand what you look like to

479
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
an attacker

480
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,280
it's obviously also quite beneficial

481
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,880
if you're offensive security

482
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,160
professional

483
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,960
and

484
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,640
you just want to be able to look at your

485
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,120
target and get a quick idea of

486
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,679
you know what would be

487
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,720
say

488
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,520
good to look at initially as a

489
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
low-hanging fruit for

490
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,280
for your target organization

491
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,360
but also if you're let's say you're just

492
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,639
starting your investigation

493
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,039
um

494
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
and you're willing to expand the scope

495
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,840
of what you're doing

496
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,360
the

497
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,480
visualization allows you to

498
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,400
expand the scope you know it allows you

499
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,360
to find additional name space

500
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,559
uh yes

501
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,360
if you are

502
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,520
considering expanding the scope of your

503
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,080
investigation

504
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,559
i personally find it easier

505
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,840
to see

506
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,880
what uh for instance networks

507
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,320
could be added to the scope

508
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,280
and where you could find additional name

509
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
space

510
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
by looking at the visualization

511
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,679
and cons

512
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,039
considering those things

513
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,400
for future enumerations

514
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,280
all right

515
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,880
so

516
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,320
i mentioned this briefly in the

517
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,679
beginning

518
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,000
but this has turned out to be uh quite

519
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,160
important so

520
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
extendability

521
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,840
you know we've tried very hard

522
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,400
to

523
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,720
um

524
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,320
you know try to get all the information

525
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,720
we can possibly find out about and uh

526
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,280
make available to users

527
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,320
you know

528
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,919
like i said we have over 70 different

529
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,360
data sources

530
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,440
not all of them are necessarily

531
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,679
free for use some of them you know

532
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,600
require having accounts with the service

533
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,720
providers

534
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,400
but all the same we've done everything

535
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,520
we can to try and bring in all the data

536
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,360
to our users

537
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,280
but

538
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,640
there's always the possibility we could

539
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,400
be missing something

540
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,760
there could be

541
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,600
data sources that they have access to

542
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,360
that we just don't know about or you

543
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,679
know that could be internal

544
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,840
so

545
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,799
we

546
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,480
added um

547
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,960
embedded scripting very similar i would

548
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,320
say to

549
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,000
the way nmap

550
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,280
offers this to users

551
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,799
and we've moved a lot of our own

552
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,880
implementations

553
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,240
of these data sources

554
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,280
to be to be scripts now

555
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,320
in this scripting engine

556
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,280
so

557
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,440
a couple advantages i guess of this i

558
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,080
mean the obvious one being

559
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,720
users have the ability to extend

560
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,200
the tool

561
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,679
which uh you know i think the big

562
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,520
the place where that can be a

563
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,799
really

564
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,400
important

565
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,600
feature

566
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,919
is when they want to bring in

567
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,400
their own asset inventory

568
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,360
to be considered in the

569
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,840
the attack surface

570
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,240
mapping

571
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,320
but for instance i've heard stories

572
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,480
where testers have said

573
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,280
they've taken their own custom tools

574
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,640
that

575
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,960
you know are looking at the targets a

576
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,159
little differently

577
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,200
and they've

578
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,240
wrapped those tools in

579
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,400
uh mass scripts

580
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,280
and then pulled the data into

581
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
a mask so that it's it's adding to this

582
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,240
a complete picture

583
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,120
so

584
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,400
you know this is

585
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,000
the one more uh

586
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,640
again important uh

587
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,480
reason i think to have this is these

588
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,559
scripts are so much easier to write

589
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,400
i mean they're shorter

590
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
uh there's a lot of examples of them so

591
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,159
it's very easy for someone to

592
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,360
you know look at one of these and then

593
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,799
write a new one

594
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,320
and

595
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,400
it really allows

596
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
the the person writing at the developer

597
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
to focus on

598
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,600
the

599
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,000
data source and how it works and not how

600
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,880
a mass works

601
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,880
so it makes it quicker for people to

602
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
contribute

603
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,960
new data sources or to enhance our

604
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,320
implementation

605
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,720
for existing sources

606
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,440
and it's really been an important

607
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,080
addition to this uh

608
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,559
this tool

609
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,840
all right

610
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,240
so what what do we want to do now i mean

611
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,120
i

612
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,360
many people have said that um this

613
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,120
project has been quite successful in

614
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,280
helping bring attack surface management

615
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,440
at least from the open you know

616
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,000
as an open source contribution

617
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,039
um

618
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,520
you know to the community that it's

619
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,480
it's

620
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,840
helped

621
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,600
shed light on how important attack

622
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,639
surface management is

623
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,240
and of course we would we would like to

624
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,880
continue uh

625
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,120
bringing that value to the community

626
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,919
both

627
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,320
from the perspective of you know as a

628
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,720
use case

629
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,000
a very

630
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,799
say

631
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,440
popular use case is uh bug bounty

632
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
hunters love this tool

633
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,600
and it's helping them find targets that

634
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,000
are in scope of bug bounty programs to

635
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,520
then test

636
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,120
uh web applications so

637
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,159
you know

638
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,120
if you're

639
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,360
at least within the context of bug

640
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,120
bounty hunting

641
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,919
uh that seems to be a pretty important

642
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,000
step right is that we're getting all the

643
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,880
possible targets so that they can be uh

644
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,360
assessed properly

645
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,200
but we also hear lots of people saying

646
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,039
how they're

647
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,279
you know putting the mass tool into

648
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,360
their continuous security and continuous

649
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
monitoring pipelines

650
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,120
so that they are always getting

651
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,600
up-to-date information on

652
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,039
what's actually exposed on the internet

653
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,840
but what can we do to

654
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,960
bring additional value or just make this

655
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,640
uh easier

656
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,799
for people in the future i guess is what

657
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,039
we're thinking at the moment

658
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,039
i think

659
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,960
you know people have shared with us that

660
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,039
this tool has become kind of

661
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,120
well the exact words i've heard some

662
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,840
people use is it's a bit of a beast

663
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,760
right because it does a lot

664
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,360
and there's a lot you could

665
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,799
find yourself learning if you're trying

666
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,360
to take full advantage of it

667
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,400
and i think for some users

668
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,159
it would just be easier if there was a

669
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,159
you know like a web ui

670
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,520
to

671
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,039
make this a bit more point-and-click

672
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,158
so this is on our um to-do list

673
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,960
while i'm not you know personally i'm

674
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,120
not much of a front-end developer uh we

675
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,640
have a lot of contributors on this

676
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,000
project and of course we're always

677
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,679
looking for more

678
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,360
but i think we can definitely

679
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,840
you know at least get a first stab at

680
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,080
this

681
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,279
in the near future

682
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,520
the part that i'm a little a little bit

683
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,080
closer to me or i definitely like to see

684
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,240
um

685
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,960
you know focus

686
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,760
on the within the project on this is

687
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,960
what are we doing with the data that

688
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,480
we're collecting so we have a lot of

689
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,279
this

690
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,279
powerful data we have

691
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,400
um

692
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
you know it's all

693
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,520
in a graph database where we have these

694
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,400
relationships uh between the assets and

695
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,520
what we're discovering you know all the

696
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,200
discoveries

697
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,799
we're already doing quite a bit with

698
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,799
this but it just seems like there's so

699
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,039
much potential to do more and make it

700
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,960
easy for users to

701
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,279
glean more useful information from what

702
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,600
we've collected

703
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,360
so that's kind of uh

704
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,120
what i've been thinking about more

705
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,039
lately and trying to get more

706
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,760
contributors focused on

707
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,559
but

708
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,400
the truth is we we have plenty of

709
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,240
contributors that are they've kind of

710
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,060
taken ownership of maintaining the

711
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,799
[Music]

712
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,640
data sources and making sure our

713
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,880
integrations are strong

714
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,840
uh

715
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,120
i've been spending a lot of my time

716
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,840
on this project maintaining

717
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,880
um

718
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
relationships with the service providers

719
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,559
to make sure that

720
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,320
you know if there's going to be upcoming

721
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,400
changes that we you know we're aware of

722
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,919
those uh

723
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,559
in advance so that you know

724
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,120
like i said earlier we

725
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,880
can

726
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,080
offer a certain amount of reliability

727
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,919
with this tool

728
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,360
and we don't have things changing out

729
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,080
from under us

730
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,880
so that's actually been

731
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,440
consuming quite a bit of my own time

732
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,039
that i have to put towards this project

733
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,520
but it's just going to have to keep

734
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,799
happening i mean it's

735
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,559
this is a high maintenance project but

736
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,240
so many people are using it every day

737
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,480
that it seems definitely worth

738
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,120
maintaining it now i think if i were

739
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,880
doing uh this slide

740
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,919
justice i think some people in owasp

741
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,679
would say i should have put a bullet in

742
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,640
here about future integrations with

743
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,799
other owasp projects there's been some

744
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,799
discussion

745
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,919
of uh

746
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,440
integrating with

747
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,080
other i'll call them

748
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
let's see tools that are useful to

749
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,880
offensive security professionals

750
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,159
that help in the assessment

751
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,960
you know with security assessment

752
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,480
i think amass

753
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,520
helps give those tools

754
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,880
scope

755
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,200
and makes it possible for them to know

756
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,520
what targets

757
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,039
are out there

758
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,320
so that they can then take it to the

759
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,640
next level and you know investigate

760
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,159
those targets and make sure that they

761
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,159
don't have vulnerabilities

762
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:28,960
so

763
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,640
i probably should have uh included that

764
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,559
because that's definitely been coming up

765
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,039
again and again in uh recent discussions

766
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,159
i just don't honestly have timelines on

767
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,679
when that's likely to happen but i'm

768
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,520
looking forward to

769
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,120
uh those integrations

770
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,840
all right with that

771
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,919
i guess i'll i'll bring it to questions

772
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,200
i think we have five minutes for

773
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
questions and

774
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,720
any questions that we don't have time

775
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,080
for

776
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,440
uh here

777
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,960
i've been

778
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,559
told that you can bring it to that

779
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,520
channel uh within our slack

780
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,000
and i'll be there to

781
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,640
help answer the questions
