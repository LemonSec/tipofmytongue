00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,320
oh yeah um thank you for attending my

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,679

and thank you for the introduction again

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,640
um so alive with the theme of this

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,800
20 anniversary event for ups uh

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,000
at uh

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,640
uh twoset i just mentioned my talk is

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,560
about

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
an ongoing resource and also a proposal

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
that on survey on the past but also look

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,600
ahead to the long-term solution for

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
security and privacy of the web

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,800
so

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,120
let's

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,760
review a little bit about the history of

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,559
the

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,719
um the web uh

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,640
so the the

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
you know that the website started about

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,039
30 years ago right when

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,520
it just started html

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,440
and then they have application with the

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,399
e-commerce and then social network right

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,280
and the current trends in the web is

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,040
ai service

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,360
ai driving services right you can see

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,680
from this diagram and by the way i

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,799
borrowed this from a medium an article

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,040
from fabric ventures

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,680
uh no but bleachers is not the other

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,759
stuff like bitcoin and the other thing

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,040
right so

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
this is not focused on

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,439
on my talk right so i just want to buy

36
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,000
out that the stay of the web and also i

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,759
want to point out here that we have

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,159
overwatch community here

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,640
like for the last 20 years right

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,720
so um

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,200
so let let's review about the formation

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,280
of the web a little bit um

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,240
i i assume that everyone from familiar

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
with the web but

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,439
um the

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,240
but just just just ensure that we are on

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,520
the same bay in this um so

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,680
the web even like how many uh evolution

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,560
or something uh happened in the future

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,119
uh the web technology right now is still

51
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,560
based on the http protocol right so

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,520
where the web browser will send uh the

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,280
request to the server and then the

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,599
server sends respond to the client so

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,040
not in the basics

56
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,560
and

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,520
nowadays the web like

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,920
contain a lot of auditing but the thing

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,879
that

60
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,720
the the basic of the web is they have a

61
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,920
test the blendtest with html uh

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,040
javascript uh right and and also some

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,480
css for

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,599
uh for the um uh

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,319
execution right execution in in in the

66
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,440
browser

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,319
so

68
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,400
uh nowaday if you can see from the

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,080
picture earlier web 3.0 have a lot of

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,160
code running in the browser is kind of

71
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,239
the ash computing

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,080
and and

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,959
here it started this you may know that

74
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,519
the javascript is now every in every

75
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,879
single

76
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,400
webpage right

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,239
and and that is the dominant uh

78
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,480
programming language for the web

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,599
right

80
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,159
so um

81
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,440
so let uh

82
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,640
um give you some example uh let me give

83
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,440
you some example about the typical

84
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,560
web-based or website web application

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,120
nowadays so normally

86
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,159
is

87
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,000
um it's not only just the the the the

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,239
that what what you see it's also have a

89
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,519
lot of internal and external code

90
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,440
running like behind the scene right and

91
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,970
normally it's also include a

92
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,360
[Music]

93
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,040
third party code

94
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,200
and

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,319
when like for example your web page or

96
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,360
your web

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
site include a code from somewhere else

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
normally you trust that code um and you

99
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,799
include that like the developer will

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,879
include that like i mean here i call

101
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,360
that by the host or the developer

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,480
um

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,080
so here i just show you an example that

104
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,159
we see like on the left hand side we see

105
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,400
at the user but on the right hand side

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,280
you see there is a tune that i use in my

107
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,239
browser they they display for like how

108
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,759
many um like external domain and the

109
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,560
code that included by you know uh in

110
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,440
this case ebay.com uh and uh there are

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,280
also other tune that they they they know

112
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,320
that

113
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,800
they track like they

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
they know like how many tractors that

115
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,400
truck uh you during this uh

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,720
visiting to to the web right

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,120
um and and these are by the way these

118
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,600
are like popular

119
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
the browser doing like uh you block

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,280
auto-gene or

121
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,520
rostering or ad block something like

122
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,800
that right

123
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,720
so

124
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,479
so this is the general um

125
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,120
web application and web in browser right

126
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,320
now

127
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,199
um

128
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,759
so my research is about like security

129
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,400
and

130
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,759
like you know the concern and the

131
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,840
privacy concern about the web right now

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,360
for the user so let's review about uh

133
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,639
the um oh by the way there is a uh

134
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,520
started this earlier that um like a lot

135
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,320
like most of the top ten thousand

136
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,199
website included snow web that is a

137
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,520
typical one that i just want to say

138
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,840
right so um

139
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,360
so so i want to review about some major

140
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,720
uh security mechanisms in the browser

141
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,960
uh for for a

142
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,600
javascript code that

143
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
because it's run in the browser so

144
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,280
javascript code

145
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,400
download

146
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,000
um from the remote server normally and

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,440
then it's run inside the browser right

148
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,440
on the on the fly

149
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,600
so the security of course must be

150
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,800
granted and in this case the

151
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,720
the execution will be in the sandbox

152
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,080
environment

153
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,240
of course the code cannot direct access

154
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,319
to your computer

155
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,120
and

156
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,360
they have some limitation about

157
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,840
about the access the computer otherwise

158
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,280
they can do whatever they want in the

159
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
computer right

160
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,639
that is one one mechanism the other

161
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,240
mechanism and

162
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,759
it's well known in the web it's called

163
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,360
same origin policy right so assume that

164
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
um

165
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,240
because the browser

166
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,960
open like too many websites like at the

167
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,039
same time and you know the user can

168
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,039
visit different side so there are some

169
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,880
confidentiality

170
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
inside that site

171
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,880
and then the browser only keep for that

172
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,800
website so for example you may know

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,720
about cookie right so quickly that sends

174
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,479
the information

175
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,199
and it's only

176
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,720
share among the origin horizon is stands

177
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,319
for uh

178
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,840
is is

179
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,120
is is formed by domain protocol and for

180
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,680
right so example here that if you

181
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,440
include or if you

182
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,639
are in this domain you cannot access the

183
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,720
data beyond the domain

184
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,759
right

185
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,639
so

186
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,919
um

187
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,039
that is like one major security

188
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,599
mechanism and

189
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,759
the other one later on was called

190
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,919
content security policy

191
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,560
this is the additional layer

192
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,000
to protect the attack for example

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,759
one of the most popular attack is

194
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,160
cross-site scripting attack that the

195
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
attacker can inject javascript code and

196
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,319
secure javascript right

197
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:32,720
um

198
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,840
[Music]

199
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,560
however uh there are some

200
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,520
uh

201
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,120
there are some limitations uh with these

202
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,000
uh

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,360
this mechanism right uh so

204
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,680
um

205
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,800
let uh i give you a scenario

206
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,080
where

207
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,160
let's say the

208
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,360
website like for example myside.com

209
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,199
include a code

210
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,080
from let's say add.com as i mentioned

211
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,319
so in this case you see that

212
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,240
when we include the code from external

213
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,639
domain or

214
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,520
remote domain right this code

215
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,360
is a different domain

216
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,160
however when it's in blue it's belong to

217
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,560
the same origin at the hosting bay like

218
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,280
in this case will be my mysite.com

219
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,080
right

220
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,479
so the issue here is that um

221
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,039
that and this is a like this is still

222
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,000
the limitation for this is that when

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,519
myself.com include the code from ad.com

224
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,279
the mysite.com

225
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,919
developer or i mean the this in this

226
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,679
case we can't provide her

227
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,040
own weight trust that dot com will not

228
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,200
ham or would not do

229
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,839
maliciously in that myside.com of course

230
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,640
right so it's uh this means it's may on

231
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,839
the the just voting right so the

232
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,519
provider will trust his partners that

233
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,000
the code will be included and then

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,240
uh of course in that case the provider

235
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,920
have to wireless

236
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,399
the this third party saying that okay

237
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,160
you were allowed to do this

238
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,240
but the issue here that

239
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,560
in the scenario the code is not

240
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,399
controlled by myself.com in this

241
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,040
scenario right so it's horse like

242
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,320
outside it's horse outside and then um

243
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,519
and then

244
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,720
in the

245
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,200
i mean in in reality the code can be

246
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
chained at any time right and and

247
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,959
seriously like there's a case that

248
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,160
the code

249
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
caused by outside can be compromised by

250
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,200
attacker not by side.com but at.com for

251
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,959
example right

252
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,720
so um so in reality that kind of attack

253
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,760
uh

254
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,440
like happened right so um let me let me

255
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,519
give you a uh

256
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,320
a real example that happened years ago

257
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,760
uh like on the website uh you may know

258
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,000
about its reuter.com right so uh so a

259
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,920
couple of years back uh user of the

260
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,480
roger.com experience

261
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,000
that uh

262
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,720
when they visit an article news

263
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,200
it's really that the user do and attack

264
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,959
the face like this

265
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,880
and and it's happening in the past

266
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,760
so the common sense in this scenario

267
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,640
clearly that reuter.com server who

268
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,160
attacked

269
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
right

270
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,519
at i mean

271
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,160
that is the the user of the writer they

272
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,600
said okay

273
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,680
something wrong happened on writer.com

274
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,560
right

275
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,040
but actually it's not like that actually

276
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,959
writer.com had not been attacked but

277
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,279
writer.com website

278
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,320
is attacked in this scenario by a code

279
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,839
injection via the compromise network

280
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,399
so the attacker injects

281
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,440
the code in the advertisement network

282
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,279
and in this case you you see the

283
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,680
scenario i i show earlier right this is

284
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,200
the kind of third-party javascript um

285
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,040
and and normally when we include like

286
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,720
that it started by by the the writer.com

287
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,480
in this case because this is a very

288
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,279
common you know the revenue system

289
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,480
right

290
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
so um

291
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,800
so at the user uh

292
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,520
what do we

293
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,839
[Music]

294
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,839
concern about right at the user so in

295
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,680
this case for example like what we

296
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,839
concerned about

297
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,279
so uh what we worry about this so

298
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,760
reuter.com example i showed you earlier

299
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,320
is example of the about security problem

300
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,399
but also similarity

301
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,399
of that is the threat of

302
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,839
privacy as well right

303
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,320
so my resource um

304
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,839
is to

305
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,920
you know consider the

306
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,279
like what the user will uh

307
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,920
worry about and what user want for this

308
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,440
and the most importantly i want to

309
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,760
protect this user from

310
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
you know cisco thread and also the

311
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,800
privacy liquid you may experience in the

312
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,880
example of the ebay.com that i mentioned

313
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,600
earlier like user have been tracked

314
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,440
right

315
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,000
and related to this question uh there's

316
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,079
a lot of study um

317
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,000
out there so for example

318
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,800
uh

319
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
one of the studies saying that a couple

320
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,440
of studies said that the citizen um

321
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,090
maybe normally just just the midtech to

322
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,360
[Music]

323
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,920
take care about their privacy right so

324
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,160
they don't know like whether the privacy

325
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,399
will be protected or not and um

326
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,079
also

327
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,399
we also have another study set up okay

328
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,200
uh

329
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,440
we are not only just uh

330
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,160
for example just block everything um

331
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
they they they just want to receive some

332
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,399
you know useful information for example

333
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,279
target asked right they they don't just

334
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,440
just block everything because um

335
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,760
that's useful to them and and and and

336
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,279
recently there's a

337
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,079
like

338
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,160
design about like

339
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,040
where

340
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,160
we uh at the user we can have advanced

341
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,440
metal

342
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,639
uh

343
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,000
to control some you know the uh the data

344
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,240
that that can be shared

345
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320
so um

346
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,680
so these are

347
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,959
the uh

348
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,519
kind of i said the dilemma for for the

349
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,279
web user right so

350
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,399
um

351
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,440
one hand uh you want to have a like the

352
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,839
protection but the other hand there will

353
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,440
be the you know

354
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,519
the way that they they want to

355
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,920
to to to receive the information for

356
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,279
example nowadays the ai driven uh in web

357
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,440
3.0 right

358
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,480
so

359
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,639
what are the solutions currently for

360
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,880
these kind of scenario right so let me

361
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,720
review uh some current approaches so

362
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,639
as i show you an example in the couple

363
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,000
of slide back

364
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,320
there's a soft term across for example

365
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,140
the user

366
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,360
[Music]

367
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,680
can install the browser extension like

368
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,279
blocker or maybe they have a in browser

369
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,519
uh blocking for example brave browser

370
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,040
now they

371
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,920
block

372
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,399
things like automatically right

373
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,240
however this has brought as you can see

374
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,600
that it's still

375
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,320
it's still like on or nothing like allow

376
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,720
or just disallow everything

377
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,199
and i mean this is about the

378
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,680
advertisement and the tracking thing

379
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,560
right

380
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,519
um

381
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,720
so

382
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,800
it's still not certified the dilemma

383
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,839
that we just discussed right

384
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,920
there are also more long-term

385
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,519
mechanism for example

386
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,440
you may hear about like do not track or

387
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,199
privacy by design

388
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,079
or

389
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,399
platform like it's gone uh be for b3p

390
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,320
uh and also recently a lot of laws uh

391
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,199
you know european law and u.s law that

392
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,279
they require the

393
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,560
uh

394
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,519
the data should be protected uh

395
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,079
for the user right however the um

396
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,279
the the

397
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,320
um

398
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,519
these mechanism

399
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,760
this just the you know the mechanism but

400
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,600
there's no way that um

401
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,800
to ensure that the mechanism can be uh

402
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,880
can be

403
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,360
applied in the reality and uh additional

404
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,880
to this uh

405
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
there's more open challenge for that

406
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,399
like for example

407
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,079
i mentioned to you about the same origin

408
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,519
policy right

409
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,320
the third particle can be malicious or

410
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
can be

411
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,839
compromised

412
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,639
so

413
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,959
um

414
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,800
and also

415
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,600
there's no control from the user and to

416
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,759
to control their data to to be safe not

417
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,800
to be safe

418
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,360
and most importantly there is no formal

419
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,279
formal insurance mechanism to warranty

420
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,560
about the

421
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,480
if the agreement or the rules are

422
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,079
enforced right

423
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,880
so that is uh these are the uh the

424
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,399
challenge

425
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
the motivation for my

426
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,040
my work on uh code origin

427
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,680
uh policy as well right so i will

428
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,560
discuss with you about the approach by

429
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,040
uh quickly so my approach is on code

430
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,360
origin policy

431
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,399
and

432
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,720
the approach is to play the reference

433
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,040
security reference monitor at runtime to

434
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,680
mediate the security and privacy grant

435
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,880
like behavior right and stay

436
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,600
the

437
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,680
the novelty here is state the origin of

438
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,800
the color of the api so in that case i

439
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,720
call that tom

440
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,440
that that data with the

441
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
code origin right

442
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,000
so in this export uh in my approach the

443
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,199
basic policy will be defined agreement

444
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,680
between the user and the provider

445
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,079
and and normally it's redeveloped by by

446
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,399
the provider so like the and the

447
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,720
developer so in this feature you can see

448
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,040
that the developer development app and

449
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,520
then they can include some javascript

450
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,799
report and then they can uh

451
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,520
give the code origin policy that i

452
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,599
provide customize that for this

453
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,919
application particularly

454
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:16,880
and then

455
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,679
it's included into the bay so in that

456
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,919
case we have a product that

457
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,280
we have the

458
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,319
uh the policy in check um the formal

459
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,799
policy is not just agreement right

460
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,440
and then where at runtime

461
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,240
this can be enforced by a reference

462
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,679
monitor right

463
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,559
so

464
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,160
in that case

465
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,960
the

466
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
the browser can

467
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,039
inform the return time monitor and the

468
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,440
the most importantly here is that

469
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,320
is it will be warranty with the formal

470
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,720
method later on um i will show you that

471
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,039
in the in the other slide but um the

472
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,280
user in this case the user can also edit

473
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,200
the policy uh

474
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,480
like according uh to to what they

475
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,320
uh they um they expect right

476
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,160
so um

477
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,320
so i give you like a little bit more uh

478
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,880
like it's not too deep the technical

479
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,760
detail but a little bit more about uh my

480
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,440
uh approach here

481
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,360
so the idea is that in the regular uh

482
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,400
execution right the api icon will be

483
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,480
executed in the javascript

484
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
environment and of course there will be

485
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,360
a stack to honda function right so our

486
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,200
approach is that we put

487
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,320
the

488
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,679
reference monitor and then we disconnect

489
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,799
this cone directly we will uh wrap the

490
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,080
cone to our monitor and then we have a

491
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,480
policy and we have a code origin policy

492
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,919
there right so at runtime we will

493
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,840
also check the policy and we check the

494
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,080
concept to know okay where the code

495
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,520
comes from

496
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,880
and and

497
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,400
um

498
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,640
and then we ask you to go to the economy

499
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
right so

500
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,200
i just give you some example of

501
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,760
the code origin policy that we have for

502
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,160
example we can define the policy that

503
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,400
different origin have different assets

504
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,240
different um

505
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,360
and different

506
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,160
uh

507
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,840
permission right

508
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,559
and

509
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,880
and more than that we can have a more

510
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,559
fighting policy for example we can

511
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,120
define that you know dynamic policy for

512
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,679
example the bowel policy limit the

513
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,640
number of assets wireless policy

514
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,120
uh history based policy and all of these

515
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,679
are like based on the code

516
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,280
of the origin it means that where the

517
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,919
code comes from right

518
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,440
so um

519
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,240
i give you uh just the illustration

520
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,520
about one

521
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,240
prototype implementation we did

522
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,440
so it is um

523
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,160
the tune is from my website we published

524
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,919
like

525
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,720
years ago that we implemented at the

526
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,360
browser extension and during the run

527
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,240
time

528
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,159
we calm the stack and then we get the

529
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,159
origin of that and then we apply the

530
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,440
policy

531
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,240
that

532
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,559
based on the origin for for the website

533
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,360
so a little bit more technical i

534
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,480
give you

535
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,440
um

536
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,000
the example of the policy how we enforce

537
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,440
this so for example the next policy is

538
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,240
we

539
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,919
monitor the

540
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,679
cookie assets

541
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,640
and then we um so cookie i said the

542
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,760
action right so we will see okay where

543
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,960
the cookie

544
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
where the origin come from

545
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,559
and then

546
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,760
we will

547
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,360
check the policy

548
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,760
if it's allowed not allowed based on the

549
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,880
um

550
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,240
the idea of

551
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,960
the code origin where the code come from

552
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,840
and also the policy for that code right

553
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,640
so some example we have earlier

554
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
is the you know just the basic

555
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,880
information flow we track the source we

556
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,640
and then we track the scene

557
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,799
uh if there is the information leaked

558
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,520
from you know scene and then we can

559
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,559
uh

560
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,280
enforce the policies and okay

561
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,679
we can do some automatically enforcement

562
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,240
on that and we prevent something that

563
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
the information liquid can happen at

564
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,360
runtime

565
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,400
in some cases we can ask the user

566
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,320
because we may not know whether it's

567
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,360
allowed or not right so so that is part

568
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,559
of the

569
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,320
god origin uh policy enforcement

570
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,799
and as i mentioned earlier the second

571
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,799
part of my approach is that the formal

572
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,840
insurance so

573
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,480
um so for the formal insurance um

574
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,280
and this is uh will be my long-term

575
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,360
research vision as well

576
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,440
um so in this uh

577
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,559
in this vision i anticipate that

578
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,960
and and my mechanism will allow the

579
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,159
code with the uh with the the web would

580
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,360
have a

581
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,440
good origin policy right

582
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
and then when the one that i showed you

583
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
earlier that i is executing with the

584
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,400
monitor but there's no

585
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,360
no formal insurance right so my my

586
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,960
research um

587
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,200
now is try to ensure that when we have a

588
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,919
good origin policy like this we also

589
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,039
have a tune to generate

590
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,240
the

591
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,440
formal

592
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,240
like

593
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,679
proof

594
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,559
that

595
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,720
within the certificate right so this

596
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,320
certificate will be together with the

597
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,120
with the the the code and also the

598
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,240
policy

599
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,520
and

600
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,360
at runtime it will be verify

601
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,520
the the if

602
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,159
the code already had the good origin

603
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,039
policy uh so that it's granted two

604
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,200
things right the first thing is it can

605
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,840
be monitored to ensure it's not valid

606
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,440
violate the policy the second thing is

607
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,240
that

608
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,000
ensure that

609
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,520
this code

610
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,760
have this kind of enforcement at one

611
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,200
time and so so at for now we explore a

612
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,000
couple of tune and um

613
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,919
like for example the

614
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,640
current tune in in informal methods but

615
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,200
um we didn't have a like the

616
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,760
final result yet but we are we're still

617
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,159
working on by okay how we generate this

618
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:28,960
uh

619
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
uh policy and

620
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,120
uh i mean the certificate and how we

621
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,679
verify this right

622
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,520
so um

623
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,640
right so

624
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,720
in the team up um

625
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,559
like

626
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,840
my research i just won like um um

627
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,200
i we do for this uh anniversary

628
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,000
event right so i just reviewed about

629
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,559
the related work my work got related to

630
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,640
do the good origin policy i just

631
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,159
mentioned with you i the way that i

632
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,840
have it the lightweight helper than in

633
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,960
javascript but by

634
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,799
more than 10 years back and i also

635
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,640
presented overwatch like 2010. um

636
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,279
not in the basic idea for for the

637
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,679
you know how to monitor the behavior of

638
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,360
the web and then we also uh have a

639
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,320
system that we apply the

640
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,760
different

641
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,679
policy for different oils in and

642
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,240
recently i moved to the code origin

643
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,640
policy that i just mentioned and also

644
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,760
also

645
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,120
provide the mechanism for the user to

646
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,720
modify the

647
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,679
the

648
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,679
policy at runtime as well

649
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,960
and

650
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,880
i just have a first prototype in called

651
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,400
origin policy implement in the browser

652
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,080
so in in the long term vision

653
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,919
i just mentioned to you the idea here

654
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,679
that

655
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,320
we can have like the

656
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,159
good origin policy uh with kind of the

657
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,960
formal privacy agreement is not just the

658
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,039
test but there's some formal way to

659
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,600
define that in the code origin policy at

660
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,440
the development phase and then we will

661
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,240
use the tune we developed a tune to

662
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,960
ensure that the certificate will be 10

663
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,039
generate and will be verified at the um

664
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,279
at the the uh

665
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,880
runtime right

666
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,520
so there's a lot of challenges here and

667
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,000
for example what type policy are used we

668
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,880
need to do the user study about this

669
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,760
another way is okay how we input the

670
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,640
regulation the laws into this policy

671
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,200
and the most challenging thing that we

672
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,039
are working on

673
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,600
by how to generate this and verify this

674
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,039
to ensure the

675
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,919
formal insurance right

676
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,240
okay so uh

677
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,120
yeah so that is um about

678
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,960
my uh

679
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,360
you know my talk um

680
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,919
just uh reveal back the

681
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,679
web history again so uh my hope is that

682
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,559
uh we have question mark here um that

683
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,200
the code origin policy will be the

684
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,159
the future solution to to to provide the

685
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,159
you know formal uh

686
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,400
insurance for for the security and

687
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,960
privacy for the web and for the web user

688
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,760
right um so just

689
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,480
three take away uh boys

690
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,720
uh

691
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,000
the current mechanism of the security is

692
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
not sufficient because they are allow

693
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,200
some attack and without privacy concern

694
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,440
so we provide the

695
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,159
approach from food origin policy and

696
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,200
have a

697
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,880
five-grain policy

698
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,480
enforcement

699
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,679
and then

700
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,400
this can empower the user to have a like

701
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,320
more control on the data

702
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
and we work towards do the formal

703
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,640
insurance to ensure that we can have a

704
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,279
formal proof that the policy enforcement

705
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,880
can provide the protection and

706
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,640
transparent without just working

707
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,600
so yeah thank you
