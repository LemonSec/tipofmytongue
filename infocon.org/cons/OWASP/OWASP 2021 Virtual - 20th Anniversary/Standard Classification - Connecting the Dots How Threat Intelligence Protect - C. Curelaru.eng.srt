00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,840
so uh

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,960
hi everyone

because it's it's uh

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,840
astonishing what the wasp did in the

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,199
last 20 years

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,880
and contributed a lot

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,880
to secure the world

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,840
and to get to get uh to the same place

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,719
uh

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,480
very very smart people

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,600
that uh have the same the same aim uh

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,600
today i'll talk a little bit about

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,440
sabotage intelligence how you can

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,760
consolidate

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,360
a company

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,719
with

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,440
with the cti

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,640
and

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
in in the context of uh

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,520
of

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,000
of course of the applications

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,719
uh but first of all who i am i'm a

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,719
doctor in colorado i'm a security

operations manager at the visma

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,680
um as a reason of competences i've

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,200
worked between

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,439
security operations security incident

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,119
response and management

33
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,439
uh product security uh dust and uh cti

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,960
of course

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,159
um

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,400
so

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,400
besides that i'm also the chapter leader

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,479
of vasti mishara

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,720
yeah where when i try to create a

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,880
community around it

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,290
uh and um

42
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,520
[Music]

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,600
the main uh the main

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,439
background that i have it's in the

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,479
networking and assistant main guy

46
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,960
after i joined the forces in the

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,560
security

48
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,119
so i'm also passionate about hiking

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,640
biking and

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,040
football

51
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,840
so cybertron intelligence what uh it is

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,000
and why uh should someone uh

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
uh

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,159
need it yeah inside the company and

55
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,240
especially for the applications

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
and after that in the second uh part of

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,239
the talk uh i'll give you a couple of

58
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,000
insights uh

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,920
on our vision or what we did to

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,840
protect applications and also the

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,959
company

62
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,800
uh and the companies that we have in

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
bisma because in this money in a

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,280
nutshell it's a conglomerate it's a

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,840
company of companies uh so we are

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,760
present in the more than

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,599
37 countries 37 offices

68
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,879
we have lots of uh companies more than

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,200
130

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,560
we also have lots of development teams

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,440
over

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,360
5k developers and lots of lines of code

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,640
and

74
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,280
on top of that we have around 30

75
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,680
existence per year so you can imagine

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,879
the challenge

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,000
uh

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,360
it's uh

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,440
it's challenging uh it's uh

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,959
something that

81
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,200
we are

82
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,040
quite enjoying because it's uh

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,720
it's fun in the same time

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,120
because in order to deliver good

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,480
products and

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
security into those products we

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,400
we deliver also

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,159
all the

89
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,080
uh areas like

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,840
uh training and awareness asset

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,560
management uh security risk management

92
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
uh code scanning

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,720
uh we are offering also software

94
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,879
composition analyzes

95
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,200
uh pen test we have a dedicated uh

96
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,760
pandas team that is doing

97
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,040
day by day

98
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,440
and it's validating the

99
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,879
applications

100
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,640
that

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,519
they do not have uh issues uh also we

102
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,400
have log management uh bug bounty areas

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,480
and uh responsible disclosure and of

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,720
course hybrid intelligence so lots of

105
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,239
things and the

106
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,720
the cherry on the kick it's the gamified

107
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,400
governance ui

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,680
web ui

109
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,799
which is a an application an index that

110
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,920
provides

111
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,159
a maturity of that application in terms

112
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,360
of security so it's it's quite uh

113
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,599
gamified approach to to security

114
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,680
so sample track intelligence what it is

115
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,358
and why we actually need it

116
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,360
those are two good questions

117
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,759
because

118
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,040
there are lots of buzzwords with uh the

119
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
cybercraft intel or at least with strat

120
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,120
intel

121
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,560
you can go

122
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,520
in lots of directions lots of uh

123
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,040
use cases

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,680
because uh we can see lots of uh

125
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,560
distinctions uh between types of uh

126
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,840
source intelligence between um types of

127
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,040
track intelligence and so on so what uh

128
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,560
what actually it's sabotage intelligence

129
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,360
uh first of all it's it's knowledge

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,600
uh if you get uh

131
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
raw data from different sources

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,960
uh and you analyze that data

133
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,800
providing a context

134
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,280
you will know exactly

135
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,400
how to prevent mitigate and you will

136
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,080
know exactly uh

137
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,680
who is attacking you

138
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
so what are their motivations what are

139
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,440
their uh tactics techniques and

140
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,240
procedures or the motors operandi uh and

141
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,320
also what indicators of compromise they

142
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,840
are using

143
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,759
and you will know as a security

144
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,199
professional or

145
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,919
as a developer to look for patterns or

146
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,479
for deviations and those deviations will

147
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,400
help you

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,600
figure out

149
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
if

150
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,360
there are attacks against your product

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,280
or not against your company

152
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,160
so uh with threat intelligence also uh

153
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,080
we can have uh

154
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,919
informed decisions from the strategic

155
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,120
point of view

156
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,520
especially in the context or in the real

157
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,880
of m a if you're buying a company you

158
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,120
definitely would like to know uh

159
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,520
what will what security landscape does

160
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,000
that company have uh

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,039
does it suffered any uh

162
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,800
breach in the past uh do they know

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,120
that breach are they aware that they

164
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,280
were hacked in the past

165
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,440
so with the cyberpunk intelligence you

166
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,319
can do that

167
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,080
also

168
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,960
one

169
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,720
another another approach is to have an

170
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,759
action oriented approach about existing

171
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,240
and emerging threats

172
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,160
so uh do you think that it's sherlock

173
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,360
holmes job

174
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,400
depends on

175
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,240
on the use cases and depends on

176
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,560
what you're after

177
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,960
it sounds like a hollywood right

178
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,319
tracked actors

179
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,960
usually say that i'm in you remember

180
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,240
like i say

181
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,960
when they said yes i mean

182
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,240
and

183
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,360
it was quite uh quite a noisy

184
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,240
week

185
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,319
that week so

186
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,720
yeah what is actually the reality uh the

187
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,919
reality is that uh we we can see

188
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,240
uh a motor supervision is always

189
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,440
changing

190
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,440
we can see that the cyber attacks are

191
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,800
constant

192
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,199
it's not a matter uh if you will be

193
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,199
hacked it's a matter that when you'll be

194
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,479
hacked

195
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,440
uh but uh if you'll be hacked you need

196
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,680
to consider to be transparent uh that's

197
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,160
what the companies need to do uh to put

198
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,720
everything under the table and uh be

199
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,479
transparent and collaborate with the

200
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,080
rest because that's uh one important key

201
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,120
in uh

202
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,840
in threat intelligence to collaborate

203
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,560
and share the findings that you have

204
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,720
because in this way we can protect and

205
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,879
uh that's also what of us did uh because

206
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,560
everyone wanted to contribute and to

207
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,520
collaborate uh in the in the community

208
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,319
uh one of the important uh uh pictures

209
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,759
that uh i've seen it's it's about

210
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,800
how cyber threatened intelligence can uh

211
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,560
map different sources so tech

212
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,240
intelligence is used usually uh

213
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,599
in in different ways uh

214
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,759
in different ways uh that

215
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,879
and uh

216
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,199
what are the drivers of success uh i

217
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,319
would say that uh

218
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,800
uh depends on each uh use case i believe

219
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,360
that cybertron intelligence uh as a way

220
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,879
to bring value

221
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
explain complex things help forecast the

222
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,039
next incident

223
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,200
that you'll have and even provide an

224
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
attacker's name to the management when

225
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,640
of course you're asked uh that's why

226
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,880
subject intelligence could help you uh

227
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,560
with that so uh the life cycle uh of the

228
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,040
of the cti so how does uh the cyborg

229
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,760
track intelligence uh yeah produce raw

230
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,080
data as i said is not the same as

231
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,040
intelligence so sabotage intelligence is

232
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,920
the finished product that comes out of

233
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,120
six

234
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
part of

235
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,880
data collection processing and analyzes

236
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,360
this process is

237
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,640
a cycle

238
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
uh because uh

239
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,880
new questions and gaps in knowledge are

240
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,240
identified

241
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,560
uh during the course of developing

242
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,200
intelligence leading to new collection

243
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,640
uh

244
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,920
requirements being set so an effective

245
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,480
and effective uh intelligence program is

246
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,080
uh iterative

247
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,959
uh becoming more refined over time so

248
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,040
feedback i would say that it's uh it's

249
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,560
the key

250
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,800
uh types of threat intelligence as

251
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,200
demonstrated

252
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,120
uh as demonstrated

253
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,160
uh

254
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,320
by threat intelligence lifecycle uh the

255
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,839
final product will look different

256
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,880
depending on the intel initial uh

257
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
intelligence requirements uh sources of

258
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,240
information and uh intended audience uh

259
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,040
it

260
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,160
can uh

261
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,240
be helpful to break down the threat

262
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,560
intelligence into a few categories like

263
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,000
uh

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,320
like this strategic tactical and

265
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,600
operational

266
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,240
of course we can go further with other

267
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,200
categories types uh but we'll not get

268
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600
into the details because we we have a

269
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,200
time limit today uh but if you're a

270
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
little sherlock holmes you can

271
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,920
find more about the types

272
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,839
and the distinctions between

273
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,000
types of craft intelligence

274
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,880
um so this is another this is i would

275
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,120
say an oversimplification of the types

276
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,839
of the cti in reality the implementation

277
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,680
of these types may vary per organization

278
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,519
so why why we need it um

279
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,680
i think that all of you remember the

280
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
dependency of confusion we had quite a

281
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,480
good

282
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,360
time

283
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,760
at that moment

284
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,480
so of course

285
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,839
nation states

286
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,440
organized crime

287
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,360
activists are

288
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,519
are there but

289
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,160
that was on the the solar winds uh

290
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,480
underpants confusion it was uh

291
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,760
a feeling that okay it's just maybe

292
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,640
another write-up of bug bounty stuff

293
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,000
but uh

294
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,560
still remember uh that evening it was

295
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
around the

296
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,760
11 p.m my time when i first read it and

297
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,839
of course shared the information

298
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,040
internally

299
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,440
on the slack channel and

300
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,000
on various places

301
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,839
and

302
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,000
next uh

303
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,959
i didn't realize at that moment how uh

304
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,600
important it was but next uh

305
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,040
next day in the morning one of my

306
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,079
colleagues that is

307
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,600
is managing the back bounty program

308
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,560
took care of it and

309
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,120
started the alarm and in just a couple

310
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,200
of hours we developed

311
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,519
a tool that

312
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,760
checked if the components were

313
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,000
vulnerable or not so uh yeah

314
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,240
threat intelligence it's a good con it's

315
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,560
it's a good uh

316
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,480
it's it's a strength to have it and to

317
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,040
share that information uh through the

318
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,959
process should strike intelligence um

319
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,920
another case uh that

320
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,399
it's it makes a reasoning why i need it

321
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,120
so

322
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,000
visma a couple of years ago was uh was

323
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,680
hacked

324
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,279
there is a really good

325
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,440
walkthrough report from recovery future

326
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,240
uh detailing exactly what the

327
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,160
apd-10 did how they did it so it's uh

328
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
it's a good

329
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,519
uh it's a good

330
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,839
walkthrough with lots of iocs and lots

331
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,000
of technical but also

332
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,839
high-level stuff that you will want to

333
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,800
find

334
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
uh so

335
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
if you want to to learn more how to

336
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,000
protect uh from nation states and yeah

337
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,480
just have uh have have read

338
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,079
and uh

339
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,839
of course uh another why it's uh the

340
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,959
uh

341
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,160
perpetu mobile like ransom uh

342
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,120
gangs

343
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,480
uh and that the fact that the cyber

344
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,680
crime

345
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,720
will

346
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,800
develop

347
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,320
year by year

348
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,560
because in

349
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,480
i've seen a report that in

350
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,560
just a couple of years

351
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,440
they will overpass the drug uh

352
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,639
the drug uh crime so

353
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,800
we need to to be prepared and to

354
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,839
strength uh our security so a couple of

355
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,720
insights what we actually did uh

356
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,519
internally uh through the cti

357
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,680
uh first of all before uh

358
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,959
having uh

359
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,399
cti uh in place or uh having

360
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,720
everything properly we developed what we

361
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,839
think one of the most advanced security

362
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,519
programs because

363
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,839
for security

364
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,440
we do everything from source code

365
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,160
analyzes to bug bounty to writing police

366
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,720
reports uh

367
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,120
and of course catching criminals

368
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,079
and for all of this we need actionable

369
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,560
intelligence so

370
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,160
also we are very careful about the

371
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,839
privacy and of course transparency uh is

372
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,000
a key like i've already told you about

373
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,880
how these models hacked in 2018

374
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,160
so

375
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,880
we transparently told uh the story to

376
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,160
the world and reuters reported it

377
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,040
so we developed also internally a

378
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,279
program for the cti

379
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,880
i will more con i'll be more

380
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,360
concentrated on the monitoring part the

381
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,120
operational part

382
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,560
because there are the

383
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,760
different uh

384
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,360
areas uh monitoring and operational uh

385
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,760
the strategical and tactical one on the

386
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,000
strategical one i want to mention uh

387
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,360
shortly the

388
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,920
uh reports that we are doing

389
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,079
by on demand

390
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,199
and with that also for the

391
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,480
m a's

392
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,880
in case that we want to buy a company we

393
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,040
are doing uh cyber traffic intelligence

394
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,560
report uh against that company uh and we

395
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,959
are scrapping everything to see uh if

396
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,440
the the company was hacked uh

397
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,399
if

398
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,399
they had some

399
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,800
credentials compromised and so on

400
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,639
uh but i'll concentrate more on about

401
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,240
the operational part

402
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,600
where we are concentrated on uh

403
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,440
payment fraud so there we have

404
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,760
a monitoring uh where we have monitoring

405
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,160
four sources like uh

406
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
criminal communities base sites and

407
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,800
other forums for relevant uh

408
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,839
payment car numbers bank identifiers or

409
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,839
either

410
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,199
specific references

411
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,880
to financial institutions or to us

412
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,639
and also we are concentrating on

413
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,079
compromised data like

414
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,759
because criminals regularly

415
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,920
upload massive caches of

416
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,560
usernames passwords to base sites or to

417
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,079
dark dark web

418
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,560
places marketplaces

419
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,680
and

420
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,440
make them available for sale on

421
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,759
underground places and we are monitoring

422
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,079
these sources with direct intelligence

423
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,040
and

424
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,000
uh

425
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,959
watch out for any leak uh

426
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,600
credential corporate data or either

427
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,040
proprietary uh code also we are going

428
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,880
into the type of squatting because we

429
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,360
want to get real-time alerts

430
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,440
on the newly registered

431
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,639
fishing

432
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,720
and type of squatting domains to prevent

433
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,040
the cyber criminals from

434
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,440
impersonating and defrauding

435
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,360
unsuspecting users

436
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,680
so uh what actually we did

437
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,440
we

438
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,600
developed the cti as a core

439
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,880
we did a surveillance or

440
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
that of your application because we

441
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,560
wanted to know exactly what application

442
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,199
it's using uh for the technology stack

443
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,320
for the

444
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,040
uh technology partners in case that uh

445
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,800
you are using a third party or you have

446
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,880
a partner that is having a

447
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,839
zero day

448
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,599
exploit do you want to know if

449
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,520
a partner has

450
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,839
zero day definitely yes so we threat

451
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,520
intelligence we need to be really fast

452
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,760
in these cases also uh in case that

453
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,559
someone is bragging on social media

454
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,079
about

455
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,119
having an exploit or

456
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,520
it's one thing

457
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,640
to

458
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,520
yeah to get your company

459
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,200
name a reputation

460
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,039
to not so good places then

461
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,640
we we are monitoring

462
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,480
that so what uh what actually we did we

463
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,760
get uh

464
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,280
deeper into the application so we

465
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,960
started the uh

466
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,280
an enumeration something like that uh i

467
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,000
would call it because yeah what your

468
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,280
application contains is the main

469
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
question so your technology stack needs

470
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
to be correlated with the entire uh

471
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,799
environment

472
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,679
uh

473
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,280
and

474
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,240
to start connect the dots basically

475
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,200
because

476
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,559
you can see here like we are

477
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,160
concentrating on service infrastructure

478
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,799
our resources all staging environment

479
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,520
all

480
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,280
environment staging production and

481
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,480
acceptance

482
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,080
public and internal

483
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,600
domains also and uh

484
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
yeah you can have here a short snippet

485
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,760
of the onboarding process

486
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,679
this is basically

487
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,280
a couple of areas that we are

488
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,440
concentrating and we are having queries

489
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,280
against it

490
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,039
and we are offering this as a service

491
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,960
inside the company because as i said we

492
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,080
are uh

493
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,360
uh

494
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,720
a company of companies and uh we are

495
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,039
serving lots of companies inside the

496
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,200
visma and all of this all these

497
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
companies could

498
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,240
on board to our services

499
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,400
it's voluntary but

500
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,360
if they

501
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,240
enumerate uh also the social media

502
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,000
technology stack infrastructure uh good

503
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,960
enough

504
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,400
we will be able to

505
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,360
uh scrap enough information uh so the

506
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,400
logic behind it uh we've set queries uh

507
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,559
either into our own tools uh or uh

508
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,200
or on a platform uh we had a partnership

509
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,400
uh

510
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,160
with recovery future

511
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,320
so basically we are

512
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,360
uh into our our onusing tools uh for

513
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,600
monitoring especially for the type of

514
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,520
squatting we are

515
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,480
monitoring

516
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,679
the potential domains that

517
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,440
will have some payloads

518
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,600
from fishing kits there so we are

519
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,919
monitoring with different uh own

520
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,440
tools but also we are monitoring with a

521
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,919
more structured platform uh like

522
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,640
recovery future so there we have queries

523
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,280
and based on all those queries we set

524
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,360
alerts so we configure the loads based

525
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,520
on the queries and all this goes to the

526
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,600
middle here which is obsgeni and after

527
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,960
that everything uh comes to the slack

528
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,160
where the first uh the first triage of

529
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,360
alerts it's

530
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,720
already happening

531
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,080
so a couple of snippets what actually

532
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,240
uh we had um you can see here um

533
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,400
proof that uh someone uh

534
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,720
posted uh something about uh visma uh

535
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,880
and about one of our uh

536
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,679
application but it was just a false

537
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,559
positive in all the situations

538
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,840
it was false positive

539
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,480
one of the big challenges here is

540
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,799
with the false positives because

541
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,799
if you are going too broad you will get

542
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,039
lots of false positives

543
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,520
so you'll need to uh to narrow down to

544
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,679
the use cases of what you actually need

545
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,280
and uh to start orchestrate what will be

546
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,320
valuable uh because these are uh real

547
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
proof that

548
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,400
uh we were after a couple of alerts to

549
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,480
try to those alerts and were false

550
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,840
positives

551
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,360
uh but

552
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,000
all those alerts uh so after you

553
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
let's say after

554
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
your software development team uh

555
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,880
provides you exactly

556
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,679
let's say the tname records redis cache

557
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,640
azure

558
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,360
sql servers databases or even cloud apps

559
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,159
and

560
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,919
all those stuff basically you watch and

561
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,480
listen um because you have the alerts

562
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
configured and try to put everything

563
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,720
into the context uh

564
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,400
to put the finding into the context so

565
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,760
um

566
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
you can see here that

567
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,120
we have

568
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,799
preferences

569
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,440
for example the the link on the git it's

570
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,720
a false positive because we are on the

571
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,580
back bounty program and we have their uh

572
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,880
[Music]

573
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,200
false positives that were supposed to

574
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
uh too tragic

575
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,159
uh but of course we had also quite nasty

576
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,120
stuff like uh on a pace bin we had uh

577
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,000
some

578
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,320
private infrastructure mentioning uh

579
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,280
also dark web mentions

580
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,760
uh most of the times uh this i would say

581
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,520
that this may sound bad but considering

582
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,280
that visma probably manages more than

583
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,360
one million accounts

584
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,440
uh the probability that

585
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,240
one of them will be infected by malware

586
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,280
every day

587
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,320
it's uh

588
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,400
it's pretty high so we are monitoring

589
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,640
the applications and there are usually

590
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,720
three main scenarios that needs to be uh

591
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,760
to be identified either if it's a user

592
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,400
uh in a visma er

593
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,240
if this is my employee uh this is bad

594
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,360
and needs to be acted upon uh or uh it's

595
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,240
a user of the customer uh of the

596
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,880
application this covers bad but it's not

597
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,640
vismos fault or responsibility if it's

598
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,679
providing

599
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,679
mfa or 2fa or any kind of

600
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,840
motivating authentication

601
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,559
and

602
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,559
the third situation is that the user

603
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,120
reads a previous customer of

604
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,400
the company

605
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,320
usually it's uh a user uh

606
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,360
the the user is the customer of the team

607
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,400
of the

608
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,280
software development product uh and it's

609
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,120
not strictly uh

610
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,799
in this case you you've seen that

611
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,799
it's it was

612
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,880
not something that we were able to do we

613
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,760
are aware so we are aware who's uh

614
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,480
packing what so just to

615
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,799
give a little bit also about what needs

616
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,120
to be shared so for example for the

617
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,080
uh

618
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,600
type of squatting that needs to be acted

619
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,200
upon and shared also with the

620
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,039
development teams

621
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,520
to know what they can expect

622
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,760
uh also with dependency confusion uh

623
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,039
that one it's a good example uh

624
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,919
how you can spread the word and act upon

625
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,000
it through the threat intelligence some

626
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,159
rules uh so

627
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,279
uh cti uh concepts and ideas are quite

628
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,200
complex so trying to find the simplicity

629
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,480
uh

630
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,840
at the far end of complexity it's uh

631
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,400
it's key

632
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,279
and

633
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,279
there are a couple of areas here

634
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,960
foundation business value requirements

635
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,360
critical thinking uh concepts

636
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,520
distinctions and resources i will not

637
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,600
dig into all of this i was planning

638
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,799
because uh

639
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,400
we are quite a

640
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,559
little bit over time

641
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,360
but

642
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,840
the foundations basically

643
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,039
with

644
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,200
the cti we know that it's it's a

645
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,679
collection uh

646
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,159
and analyzes of information about cyber

647
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,559
uh threats and adversaries so

648
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,960
driving the creation uh

649
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,400
of threat models

650
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,440
that provides uh the ability to make uh

651
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,320
the knowledgeable decisions uh is key

652
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,159
also business value cti should help uh

653
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,600
business uh and should help uh reduce

654
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,720
the effectiveness of existing emerging

655
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,919
and

656
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,480
predicted cyber threats

657
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,799
against the product and the company and

658
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,840
the requirements also should be

659
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,559
objectively family and actionable that's

660
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,919
one of the most important thing to be

661
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,840
actionable also critical thinking is

662
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
highly important for uh trade

663
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,900
intelligence

664
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,320
[Music]

665
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,480
and in terms of resources there are

666
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,840
quite a lot

667
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,880
um and to summarize um so we have um we

668
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,480
we have seen track intelligence is

669
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,279
surrounded by myths and by buzzwords but

670
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,360
it's important to find uh our path

671
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,640
between uh this law this wrong ideas a

672
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,880
track intelligence provider delivers

673
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
intelligence that you can consume by

674
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,679
different profiles uh with different uh

675
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,080
expectations these expectations are

676
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,520
supposed to

677
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,480
uh

678
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,200
solve various use cases uh the last but

679
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,559
not the least yes

680
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,880
track intelligence can uh be a driver

681
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,760
for

682
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,000
cyber security some security return of

683
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,400
investment if the structure cost is

684
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,320
measured uh as part of the equation so

685
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,159
uh the learning

686
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,279
path is quite fun because i would see

687
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,480
this as an opportunity uh also in the

688
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,279
application world because uh cti is

689
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,679
lacking at this moment uh a methodology

690
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,159
it's uh more like dust in the early

691
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,440
beginning

692
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,600
uh and i think that it's that's a proper

693
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,440
comparison

694
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,600
and

695
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,840
[Music]

696
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,520
in different companies uh the

697
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,799
intelligence is uh probably it's

698
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,840
shared but uh hardly used and from ten

699
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,480
times is also too too biased

700
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,679
um and also distribution is difficult uh

701
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,600
but it's it's one of the most promising

702
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,559
concepts and um

703
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,720
although cybertron intelligence is

704
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,679
fairly new it isn't uh all different

705
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,360
from the traditional intelligence

706
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,559
analysis

707
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,679
uh so we shouldn't forget the lessons uh

708
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,159
learned from the intelligence community

709
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,240
as they have a lot to teach us

710
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,279
and we don't need to reinvent the wheel

711
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,360
so uh thank you very much and if you

712
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,320
have questions uh i'm available on the

713
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,720
slack after

714
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,400
after the

715
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,400
talk
