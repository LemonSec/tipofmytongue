[Music]

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,160
good okay so this talk is about agile

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,400
threat modeling with open source tools

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,240
hopefully letting become threat

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,119
modelling part of devsecops let's see

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,279
so i was already introduced so i'll skip

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,680
that slide and jump right in

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,920
so you can ask yourself that's not meant

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
to be a poll but you can ask yourself

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
the question of whether you are doing

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,920
thread modeling in your projects or not

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
and eventually not

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,239
all projects you think of might be doing

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,000
it in a in a way that would be

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,920
sufficient

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,320
at least when it comes to frequent

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,320
releases or even agile sprints so if a

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,079
project is conducting threat modeling

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,079
workshops which is good

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,760
most of the times this is in the

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,360
beginning in the initial phase of the

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,840
project and not being repeated or

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,399
incrementally updated during the

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,199
follow-up releases and spreads

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,920
so that was something i tried to tackle

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,879
and

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,240
how did we tackle the testing problem in

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,320
terms of security tests for example in

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,119
devops by just automating things as best

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,280
as possible so some people call it

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,119
devsecops but it could also be just

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,920
called devops so that security should be

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,520
obvious in that

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,439
and that has

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,159
succeeded due to some kind of automation

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,119
magic so all of these tests we nowadays

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,280
use in pipelines are more or less

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,840
automated scanning codes scanning

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,159
dependencies and things

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,360
so the idea was to tackle the same thing

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,439
now this problem of integrating threat

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,159
modeling into devsecops in the same

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,960
style by automating things as best as

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,799
possible and let eventually thread

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,640
models also be something like code

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
what are the benefits of code

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,360
it's editable in any ide

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
even vi if you want

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
checked into the source tree so that's

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
basically living along with a project if

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,600
you want to check that in into that

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
projects folder

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,239
you can div it revert it it's branchable

54
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,720
mergeable just as well code which is

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,160
actually would be

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,760
and therefore it's collaboration capable

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,000
and testable verifiable

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
reproducible in terms of what it creates

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,760
as a result so these are some some major

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,319
benefits and also it clearly states the

61
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,920
most recent update in the revision

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,959
history so if the project received lots

63
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,280
of merge requests and grew and grew over

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,840
time but the threat model not so that

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,840
basically is a sign of eventually

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,879
something's

67
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,200
left over there

68
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,000
and developers hopefully love code and

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,080
they know the application best usually

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,360
they should

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
there might be some more benefits but

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,080
what about the drawbacks of code

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
having a thread model as code

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,120
it's code someone has to write it

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,879
differently

76
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,480
some people might find code hard to read

77
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
me being a developer i'm not going along

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,480
with that argument but i totally

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,879
understand that that's not something

80
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,200
everyone finds pretty easy to read

81
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
totally understandable

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
and it starts with the details that's a

83
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,599
major drawback when it comes to modeling

84
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,360
it starts with the details not the

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,920
abstractions so it's not easy to spot

86
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
the big picture just by looking at the

87
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,760
details first

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,159
that's definitely a list of drawbacks

89
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,000
might be some more just

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,599
some examples

91
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,879
so how now can threat modeling be part

92
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,599
of

93
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,519
def segments

94
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,280
environments

95
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,599
and having something like threat models

96
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,360
as code

97
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,879
the idea was to have some kind of simple

98
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,200
solution that combines those

99
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,519
major benefits but have

100
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,439
as few as as necessary of the drawbacks

101
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,400
and that means well better don't let it

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,439
be coding in terms of real source code

103
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,439
but something that's processable like

104
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,959
code and more easy to read and to write

105
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,959
for human and the easiest markup

106
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,799
language that a human hopefully can

107
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,040
easily write and read would be yummle

108
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,840
many times we're using that in devops

109
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
environments workflows and stuff like

110
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,639
that so it's already understood by all

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,120
ides and it's pretty simple and easy to

112
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,960
read and write and pretty simple and

113
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,040
easy to consume from a program's point

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,880
of view

115
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,639
and then the idea was to describe in

116
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,280
that yaml file the classic elements of

117
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,759
your thread model your architecture

118
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,720
the data assets your processing

119
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,360
is it financial data reporting data

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,600
health data personal identifiable

121
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,759
information whatever kind of data assets

122
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,840
you have

123
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,400
the technical components so basically

124
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,720
those boxes one would draw on a white

125
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,479
bottle on a flip chart

126
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,720
if it was a classic threat modeling

127
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,880
session so your technical components

128
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,360
your services your processes

129
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,080
your data stores

130
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,800
and the communication links so that

131
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,360
the lines connecting all those elements

132
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,320
so where the data is actually flowing

133
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,199
and finally the truss boundaries so to

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,479
have some kind of boxes separating one

135
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,800
set of components against another set of

136
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
components and separating that from

137
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,880
other ones so the classic trust

138
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,199
boundaries like network trust boundary

139
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,600
or cloud security groups or network

140
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,720
isolation policies or stuff like that

141
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,479
then the idea was to use some kind of

142
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,479
open source tool to analyze that as a

143
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,479
graph of connected components with data

144
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,800
flowing between them analyze that model

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,120
file

146
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,560
searched for that

147
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,639
but didn't find anything

148
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,560
that i was

149
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
saying that was uh

150
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
matching these kinds of um requirements

151
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,080
for me and so i created one that creates

152
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,800
model graphs out of the model file so we

153
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,240
still need to have some visual

154
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,759
representation

155
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
that is allowing to

156
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,560
spot as a human that we misplace some

157
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,319
component in the wrong box in the wrong

158
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,639
corner or we draw a wrong connection

159
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,280
between a few components so we missed

160
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,720
some other connections that should be

161
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,039
there so we still need that visual graph

162
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,560
the diagram definitely but we're not

163
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,479
starting with the diaphragm

164
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,880
so they can be generated

165
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,960
the threats the risks the best basically

166
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,680
is the outcome of a threat analysis that

167
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
needs to be created definitely and

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,600
hardening recommendations how to

169
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,160
mitigate those kinds of risks and

170
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,280
threats

171
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,000
in the architecture so

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,319
giving potential development teams

173
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,720
those kinds of tips and hints where to

174
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
look for how to mitigate the identified

175
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,880
risks

176
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,319
and that's more for the bigger

177
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,400
corporations also very important all

178
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,080
those kinds of documentation

179
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,240
requirements and reports that need to be

180
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,080
created that can be created from the

181
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,000
detailed model file hopefully as well

182
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,680
and that's what i created it's basically

183
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,479
an open source project uh fragile that's

184
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,560
an agile threat modeling toolkit if you

185
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,919
name it that way

186
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,240
it's living on github and docker hub

187
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,199
it's mit license so very permissive open

188
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,560
source license

189
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,639
and it's exactly doing that so you

190
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,440
create a thread model as a yaml file and

191
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,240
then it generates all those nice outputs

192
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,440
and does a rule-based risk analysis and

193
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,039
you can even add custom risks that's

194
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,960
also important because you should

195
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,560
definitely from time to time conduct

196
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,240
those workshops they are

197
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,319
not superfluous no they are definitely

198
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,080
very important and very good but you

199
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,120
cannot do that it on every sprint so

200
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,039
this can be seen as some baseline threat

201
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,080
modeling

202
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,560
with a rule rule-based detection and

203
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,800
from time to time in major releases you

204
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,960
can have those bigger

205
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,919
workshops to actually get also to those

206
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,000
threads that no two will ever identify

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,520
like business threads but they can be

208
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,120
added to the model manually as well

209
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,440
well it's technology aware modeling so

210
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,560
you model with some kind of detail in

211
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,360
terms of technology types being used or

212
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,680
protocols being used so that there is

213
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,039
rules and there are over 40ish in that

214
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,120
can analyze the graph

215
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
very precisely leading to less false

216
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,919
positives

217
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,160
and of course it has a rule a plug-in

218
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,080
interface that you can plug in your own

219
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,800
custom risk rules yeah to extend that

220
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,400
and a few more values are being

221
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,440
calculated what this means raa and dbp

222
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,039
just a few minutes later going into that

223
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,039
thresher also has some kind of model

224
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,360
macro concept that means that you can

225
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,599
automate certain changes to the model of

226
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,000
certain enhancements or adjustments in a

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,959
wizard style question and answer

228
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,839
giving you some way to automatically

229
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,720
enhance existing model files depending

230
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
on some questions that you're asked and

231
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,519
answer them so that can be used like

232
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,080
adding a build pipeline to a threat

233
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,839
model that's one of the existing model

234
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,640
macros that basically asks you questions

235
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,480
about how your software gets built and

236
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,160
deployed and then it automatically

237
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,040
extends the model to include these

238
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,600
elements in these data flows

239
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
as said trencher is released as open

240
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,920
source software mit license and runs

241
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,160
totally offline of course so that's

242
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,360
definitely something easy to use

243
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,800
here you see it it's a docker container

244
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,600
everything included and it's a command

245
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,440
line interface so it's basically just a

246
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,279
simple cli

247
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,839
to work on that model file and generate

248
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:36,959
the output

249
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,360
or you can also start it as a rest

250
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,839
server a web server with a rest api so

251
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,920
if you want to have it running remotely

252
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,080
somewhere on your premise then you can

253
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
also run it as a server if you like

254
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,120
and the first steps when you're working

255
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,640
with fragile is to

256
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,800
well either take the filled example

257
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,399
model to play with that or just the

258
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,480
minimal stop model which is a very

259
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,959
simple model containing just the minimum

260
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,120
input that you can then use as the

261
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,600
foundation for adding more data assets

262
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,760
technical assets communication links and

263
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,640
trust boundaries

264
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
here we see an example data asset

265
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,920
modeled in yaml in the thread model file

266
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,839
so it's here some customer contracts

267
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,160
whatever it's taken from the example

268
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,120
it's

269
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,760
that each data asset has an id an

270
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,320
identifier assigned and a little bit of

271
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,200
description for the documentation

272
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,240
and the lower three lines

273
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,040
confidentiality integrity and

274
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,440
availability that's basically where you

275
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,920
rate your data asset in terms of these

276
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,880
protection goals

277
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,920
and then you model the technical assets

278
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,519
the components you would draw on a

279
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,640
whiteboard

280
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,560
here's some example also from the

281
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,600
example file a web server with an id

282
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,640
obviously to reference that later on a

283
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,959
selection of type that's from classic

284
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,200
threat modeling is it a process a data

285
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,320
store or an external entity

286
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,160
a little bit of more questions to be

287
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,839
answered and also some information about

288
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,320
the encryption of that thing or also the

289
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,560
cia confidentiality integrity and

290
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,800
availability ratings and a little bit

291
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,360
more that you can supply as a little bit

292
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,440
more detail

293
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,000
and most importantly you reference on

294
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,680
that data asset

295
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,360
sorry on the technical asset you

296
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,240
reference what data assets are being

297
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,880
processed or stored on that kind of

298
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,760
thing

299
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,519
so if it's a data store it would be more

300
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,079
on the stored assets side i would

301
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,040
suppose

302
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,160
but also

303
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,880
a web server processes sensitive data

304
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,959
eventually so that you can reference

305
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,640
that way

306
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
and then the outgoing communication

307
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,079
links basically drawing the lines

308
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,800
between the components

309
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,040
here under a technical asset you're just

310
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,160
referencing a an erp system for that

311
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,040
example here and you specify a protocol

312
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
here you've got a large list of

313
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,560
protocols you can choose from and that

314
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,360
basically means thresholds automatically

315
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,680
if it's an encrypted protocol of course

316
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
taking this as an encrypted protocol

317
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,760
otherwise it's unencrypted

318
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,279
and also you can supply what kind of

319
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,839
authentication and authorization is

320
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,079
being used if it's an authenticated and

321
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,000
authorized

322
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,040
checked

323
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,680
communication link a little bit of more

324
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,760
things you can optionally answer and

325
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,079
also here again most importantly you

326
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,040
reference the data assets that get sent

327
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,720
and received by that communication link

328
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,880
and last but not least the trust

329
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,360
boundaries those boxes that you

330
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,839
basically use to group and isolate

331
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,920
certain components from other parts of

332
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,600
your architecture

333
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,920
there are different types of

334
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,600
trust boundaries that you can choose

335
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
from network security group network vlan

336
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,279
or cloud security group things or

337
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,600
isolation policies and containerized

338
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,079
environments and stuff like that

339
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,880
so here you give it just a name and also

340
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,839
you just reference the technical assets

341
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,000
that are being

342
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,399
placed in that kind of trust boundary

343
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,720
and you can also nest them to have some

344
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,800
kind of nested trust boundaries like

345
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,920
cloud network and certain um

346
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,519
cloud security groups in that

347
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,800
at the end what's a fragile run

348
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,639
it's just reading that yaml file

349
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,279
processing it executing all the built-in

350
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,519
risk rules including the custom develop

351
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,839
once if you have any and create some

352
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,920
nice output

353
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,240
here that's the example model uh coming

354
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,920
from the fragile

355
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,639
docker container and here you see it's

356
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,199
auto layout generating some kind of

357
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,800
visual representation of your

358
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,079
architecture

359
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,000
so the shapes and the colors they

360
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,040
resemble uh certain things especially

361
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,600
the the lines and the border colors

362
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,760
where sensitive data is flowing or

363
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
stored so that you can easily spot in

364
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,000
the picture where the hot zones are that

365
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,320
you need to protect more than others

366
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,160
other irs of your

367
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
environment

368
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
and some pdf and excel reports are

369
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,720
generated the pdf report with a risk

370
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,279
result the risk analysis result is a

371
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,959
little bit long it's very both because

372
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,760
it has three redundant

373
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,120
angles to view the same content so first

374
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,680
it's a view of the risks by

375
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,519
vulnerability category that have been

376
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,720
identified

377
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,880
the other one is representing more or

378
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,639
less the same data

379
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,560
but by technical assets so it's a

380
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,399
different kind of grouping

381
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,279
and the third one is for the data

382
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,519
assets to present

383
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,920
the risks associated to those data

384
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,600
assets

385
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,680
some kind of impact analysis including

386
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
manually edit risks if you added any of

387
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,480
that

388
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,360
and you've got a before and after view

389
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,760
so you can also maintain the risk

390
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,920
mitigation state inside threaja in the

391
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,120
yaml file

392
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
so each risk gets an unique identifier

393
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,040
that you can then use in the model file

394
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,839
to assign a state of whether that risk

395
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,560
has been accepted if you want to just

396
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,360
carry that or if it's in progress of

397
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,519
being resolved or has already been

398
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,079
mitigated or something like that so you

399
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,600
can assign a state and you see the

400
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
diagram then by

401
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,560
identified risk criticality and

402
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,399
the bar chart then basically in terms of

403
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,720
the colors gives you an impression of

404
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,440
how many percentage of those identified

405
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,120
risks are still unchecked that's not

406
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,839
good obviously here in the example mode

407
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,040
good and then you get the impact

408
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,639
analysis of the remaining risks

409
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,959
those that you want to or need to keep

410
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,480
because you cannot or do not want to

411
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,120
mitigate them so the remaining risks

412
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,720
basically are those that need to be

413
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,639
accepted by someone later on if you're

414
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,839
into the classic stride modeling of

415
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,160
analyzing threats on an architecture

416
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,560
here you have a grouping of the same

417
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,199
identified risks to their respective

418
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,360
stride categories and you can click on

419
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,160
each of these titles to jump directly to

420
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,320
that risk chapter so the pdf is quite

421
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,279
good to navigate it's fully linked and

422
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,880
same is here for the assignment by

423
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,279
functions so what kind of

424
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,160
group

425
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,680
should usually

426
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,639
take care of that mitigation step or

427
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,720
mitigation steps so is it either

428
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,240
something to be addressed or checked

429
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
with the business side on architecture

430
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,959
level development or eventually also on

431
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,119
the operations

432
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,320
nice one relative attack attractiveness

433
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,040
this one is also generated that's a call

434
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,199
calculator actually that's a value

435
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,199
that's a number ranging from zero to a

436
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,440
hundred percent that's a plugable

437
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,759
algorithm inside treasure and the

438
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,880
default one is basically assessing each

439
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,399
of the modeled components uh to see what

440
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,519
kind of data that is stored or processed

441
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,199
it's more interesting for an attacker if

442
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,519
it's stored data of course

443
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,919
on or by that component and how this

444
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,240
data of these data assets are rated in

445
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,480
terms of confidentiality integrity and

446
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,679
availability

447
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,520
and the higher the rating and the more

448
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,400
interesting data there is the higher the

449
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,039
uh the number for that component and

450
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,720
then in the second run in the

451
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,439
calculation uh even those components

452
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,359
sitting close to

453
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,119
an interesting component in terms of

454
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,360
having interesting data to be stolen

455
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,799
eventually

456
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,200
but itself the other one the neighbor

457
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,440
component not having any interesting

458
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
sensitive data like just being a simple

459
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,080
monitoring whatever that has some kind

460
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,559
of connection to the interesting system

461
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,440
then even the by itself not being very

462
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
interesting from a taker's point of view

463
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,640
monitoring thing gets a

464
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,440
nice promotion in terms of this value

465
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,200
relative attack attractiveness because

466
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,679
it sits quite close to very interesting

467
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,559
component and might be a pathway that an

468
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,039
attacker can get a foothold into that

469
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,840
target uh component actually so that's

470
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,600
like lateral movement in a back-end

471
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
system something like that so those

472
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,760
close to interesting systems that are

473
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
also in terms of connections that are

474
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,640
also higher rated in that algorithm so

475
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,559
you see in bigger architecture that's a

476
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,520
very simple example here you see given

477
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,000
that ria value where you should put

478
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,120
usually your most direct prioritization

479
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,200
on hardening those systems and

480
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
eventually isolating them

481
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,440
on

482
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,760
and also some other values calculated

483
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,919
that basically resembles the blast

484
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,320
impact of a risk if it actually

485
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,000
manifests

486
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,080
so that means

487
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,039
the the data view here in the report

488
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,039
lists the data assets that you have

489
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,559
modeled and they are all having some

490
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,480
data loss probability or data breach

491
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,799
probability assigned

492
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,320
that's actually um a a value that is

493
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,520
taking into account of where those data

494
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,880
asset is stored or processed where in

495
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,440
terms of on what components and what are

496
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,840
the the associated risks of that

497
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,880
component due to the threat model rules

498
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,760
and if such a component has a high risk

499
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,960
of

500
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,160
being

501
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,200
attackable in one way and this is not

502
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,120
mitigated then basically the the risk of

503
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,960
having a data breach with that data

504
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,720
asset being part of that

505
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,559
also is elevate so here in that

506
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,120
result you see basically if you're very

507
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,960
interested in keeping certain data

508
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
assets are secure hopefully you should

509
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,880
keep all of them secure but some

510
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,320
eventually more

511
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,799
then you see a listing of what risks you

512
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,440
should check and mitigate first to

513
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,679
reduce the data breach probability for

514
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,760
that data asset so that's basically the

515
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,600
same view and the same data but from a

516
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,520
different angle you're coming from the

517
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
data assets point of view what you need

518
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,360
to do to mitigate risks there

519
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,799
of course the risk mitigation

520
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,720
recommendations are also in the report

521
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,760
so

522
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,840
giving the developers so whoever

523
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,360
consumes that

524
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,280
security analysts

525
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
information about what the impact of

526
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,120
that risk would be how it's detected and

527
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,760
what the false positives could be so

528
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,520
that you have got a very nice

529
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,960
description of what you should check of

530
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,880
whether if that's the case then it might

531
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,960
be a false positive

532
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,440
and also the mitigation steps that's

533
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,960
most importantly for the development

534
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,080
team so architecture to have a clear

535
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,559
listing of what should be done to reduce

536
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,400
that risk from uh

537
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,120
manifesting and i'm referencing lots of

538
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,520
very excellent oh wasp stuff like owasp

539
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,320
asvs chapters and the brilliant cheat

540
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,240
sheets that's very excellent so that

541
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,480
developers have direct input that they

542
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,200
can consume

543
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
and then the risk instances are listed

544
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,280
where those risks are identified you

545
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,360
even see some rating depending on the

546
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,039
sensitivity of the data that's sitting

547
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,039
there whether it's medium elevated or

548
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,840
high severity and the state so here in

549
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,440
this example many of them are in

550
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,679
unchecked states still but some are in

551
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,600
accepted or mitigated states so this is

552
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,559
also updated in the report once you fill

553
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,600
the mitigation state into the model file

554
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
if you're into that that's okay the pdfs

555
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,400
but

556
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,919
more or less when you're using it many

557
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,039
times then you get to you you get used

558
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,440
to using that and knowing what's inside

559
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,200
that then you usually work with the

560
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,679
excel reports that you can filter and

561
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,960
easily

562
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,200
screen and glance over the identified

563
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,960
risks and threats and get to the

564
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,360
mitigation state as well so same data

565
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,039
easier to consume

566
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,200
that's what i use many times because

567
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,919
making that part of def ops or devsecops

568
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,159
means to automate things so

569
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,559
also the results are presented as json

570
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,760
that can be processed obviously

571
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,000
we have a set of constantly growing risk

572
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,559
rules so it's currently 40 something and

573
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,200
so here an example risk rule by the way

574
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,280
fragiles wouldn't go

575
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,679
simple go code here so you see the text

576
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,440
and you see that being

577
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,760
is being used for the documentation

578
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,320
and also you see the um the document

579
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,200
generation you see the rules are

580
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,919
basically uh blooping and

581
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,919
walking over that graph and checking

582
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,000
certain aspects to create and identify

583
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,039
these risks with as few false positives

584
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,120
as possible

585
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,679
editing support is also available so if

586
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,799
you fear editing a big yamo file it's

587
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,280
easy because ides have very nice

588
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,919
navigation for that and there's a schema

589
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,080
available that you can import yaml

590
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,919
schema from fragile that basically gives

591
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,600
you linting here you see on the left

592
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
side a typo web server

593
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,840
so it says that's not in the enum of

594
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,000
allow technologies here so that's a

595
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,400
wrong value and you can just

596
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,720
type begin typing and then the auto

597
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,880
completion box pops up and it it's

598
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,360
basically quite easy to code that or to

599
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,520
create that

600
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,480
this tracking status also taken care of

601
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,360
so you have a set each risk has a unique

602
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,080
identifier a speaking one the untrusted

603
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,799
detailization erp system or

604
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,320
ldap injection at something asterisk and

605
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,480
so you can have in these groups i can

606
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,120
even use wildcards to

607
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
assign a certain state to a group of

608
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,600
risks i would not recommend that better

609
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,400
being on the one-on-one level here but

610
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,799
if you want to group certain risks and

611
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,200
give them all the same state at once you

612
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,559
can do this as well and you can

613
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,799
reference some external things like a

614
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,039
justification tax ticket idea link

615
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,120
whatever you want to put into the report

616
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
and the status that's important of

617
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,279
either being unchecked in discussion

618
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,840
accepted in progress mitigated or false

619
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,720
positive

620
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,120
what about bigger models yep

621
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,039
another example one and that's just a

622
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,880
very small compared to the biggest ones

623
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,080
that i have seen

624
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,000
customer sides but that's a different

625
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,440
story here and that's an example model

626
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,159
again so even use one example file here

627
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:04,880
that

628
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
creates something that still fits on

629
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,679
that slide

630
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,080
and even here the auto layout is

631
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,000
automatically creating that in a very

632
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,679
nice way so it's even some nice

633
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,240
documentation built bottom up

634
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,640
a rest server is existing as set so you

635
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
can even have that running as a rest

636
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,400
service instead of the command line

637
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,880
interface if you want to do that and we

638
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,039
have model macros that can automate in

639
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,720
an interactive wizard style certain

640
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,360
things like adding build pipelines or

641
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,600
adding vault or identity provider or

642
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,559
whatever to the model

643
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,520
if you're using github there's a for ci

644
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,320
cd there's a an example online in the

645
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,279
repo which is a github integration with

646
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,559
a github workflow so here's uh an

647
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,559
example there's an official thread drill

648
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,960
action for github that you can use so

649
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,679
every time a fragile model gets pushed

650
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,559
to the repo then the fragile action is

651
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,559
actually executing and running on that

652
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,559
model it generates the results the

653
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,400
reports and you can even if you want to

654
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,919
do that auto update the um

655
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,440
the repository

656
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,360
page if you want to do that

657
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,240
or other way anyway process the results

658
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,159
good well

659
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,480
hopefully the possible effects of that

660
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,159
uh kind of um open source tool to uh

661
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,039
model threats and and your architecture

662
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,520
in an agile fashion so it's basically

663
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,760
that some corporations might eventually

664
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,919
come up with custom coded risk rules

665
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,000
that can analyze the model graph so if

666
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
you have custom policies you'd like to

667
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,159
be checked and vetted against your

668
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,799
architectures your projects that's a way

669
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,640
of doing that like certain components

670
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,400
need to be in certain areas or something

671
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
like that

672
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,720
and you can get a uniform documentation

673
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,960
hopefully well being built up

674
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,320
of your landscape

675
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,400
bottom up that means by the development

676
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,799
teams where in the ide basically they

677
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,960
know the applications they're creating

678
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,679
best so it's where the truth lies

679
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,080
you can instantly regenerate all of that

680
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,640
so either if a data classification

681
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
changes or you shift some component into

682
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,520
the cloud you can regenerate the result

683
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,760
or you can do it corporate wide if

684
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,159
you're in a regulated domain where you

685
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,240
for example have a new policy that you

686
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,480
need to implement in terms of security

687
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
by some due date then you can have a

688
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,039
custom risk rule eventually for that and

689
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,120
you can then basically regenerate all

690
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,240
the models

691
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,000
for your projects and you then you would

692
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,640
see which of these uh eventually catch

693
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,880
some to do's until that due date

694
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,360
as said that's the thing i'm in cicd

695
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,440
pipeline so to automate these things so

696
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,320
that can easily be put into clcd

697
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,200
pipelines to have some kind of trend

698
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,919
analysis or some warnings when some

699
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,000
rollout might happen

700
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,240
with unchecked high risk still being

701
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,559
there so no one has checked these high

702
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,960
risks that's not good to go live then so

703
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,080
eventually this means threat modding is

704
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,080
part of devsecops hopefully that's the

705
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,320
case

706
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,640
so security eventually can also be less

707
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,840
bottleneck

708
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,279
for threat model signus so focusing more

709
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,720
on the business risks and those kinds of

710
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,960
technical risks that no

711
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,279
tool could ever identify but having the

712
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,880
baseline

713
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,120
checks and risk analysis happening in an

714
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,799
automated way so that would be nice

715
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,120
good well what are the upcoming features

716
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,520
more documentation samples screencasts

717
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
there's a video already online a little

718
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,760
bit more should be coming uh web-based

719
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,679
model editor that would be cool if you

720
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,200
take a look in the code you see that the

721
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
rest api has even

722
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,279
the foundation for that even more than

723
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,679
what's documented in the open api

724
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,600
specifications so that's the foundation

725
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,559
of something that can evolve easily into

726
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,960
some web-based model editor

727
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,120
also linking that's a feature that i've

728
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,399
been

729
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,320
missing scene that

730
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,640
users of fragile are demanding that in a

731
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,679
very very high amount so to have some

732
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,000
kind of way to split models into sub

733
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,720
models and link or include them so the

734
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,039
idea is here to have in the next version

735
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,360
then layered graphs so basically you've

736
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,640
got a a visual representation where the

737
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,960
surrounding context systems out of scope

738
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,120
are just black boxes okay with the

739
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,960
connections going in and if that's

740
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,640
another model that's existing somewhere

741
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,480
else and it's properly linked then you

742
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,919
can have a second

743
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,000
layer being rendered where you drill

744
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,480
down into these systems as well and see

745
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,799
their details so that would be nice

746
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,159
cloud crawlers also some nice idea to

747
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,200
use them as a model marker to get the

748
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,720
input from your cloud environment and

749
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,880
then you can select and choose what

750
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,399
components you would like to pull into

751
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,679
your model

752
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,520
gitlab integration you've seen already

753
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,240
github has been finalized gitlab well

754
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,720
i've seen a ticket online that they're

755
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,480
considering uh to

756
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,240
think of fragile being eventually part

757
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,880
of the cicd thing there as well in a

758
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
similar way that would be nice

759
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,760
and

760
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,240
eventually also could use some input

761
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,919
from cloud formation or terraform to

762
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,399
seed the initial model

763
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,399
good also bug tracker integration that's

764
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,640
very important jira defect dojo and

765
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,120
anything else would be nice to have some

766
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,039
kind of

767
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,279
consistent way of handling the output

768
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,840
the tasks for development teams or

769
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,840
whoever of the team should check those

770
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,880
output

771
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,279
and eventually integration withdraw io i

772
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,799
would i would say eventually as a

773
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,360
possibly as an initial sketch

774
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,440
to create that thing and seat it into

775
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,679
the model file that needs to be worked

776
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,679
on we will see how this will be a thing

777
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,000
good also your ids and feature requests

778
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,399
are very welcome so feel free to follow

779
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,559
them on the github repo you've got the

780
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,039
website on fragile io or you can have

781
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,200
the playground on run fragile io where

782
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,039
you can basically see the docker

783
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,880
container that you can just download

784
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,799
running there as well so you can play

785
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,840
with that

786
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,799
we do have a chat guitar community chat

787
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,279
and the source code as set sitting on

788
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,679
github mit license very permissive open

789
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,320
source license and the container ready

790
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,279
to run also sits on docker

791
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,360
nice so for my side thank you very much

792
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,760
thank you for your time and

793
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,559
well then time for some good and nice q

794
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,639
a on the slack show see you there
