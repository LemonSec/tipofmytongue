1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,030
[Music]

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,920
so hopefully in this talk i can convince

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,840
you to go for

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,800
automation uh t he bad pun dad joke um

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,160
yeah i want to tell you the some of the

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,439
lessons i've learned about trying to

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,760
automate security make things go faster

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,199
so you can look awesome and you don't

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,720
have to tell your boss right this is

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,640
just like look awesome and get a raise i

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,199
think that's all a good thing

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,519
so who am i i'm uh i like to call myself

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,239
a reformed programmer i started out life

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,399
writing code as a full-time job and then

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,160
got the security bug and never looked

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,640
back uh i've had 13 plus years in the

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,040
west community like martin was saying

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,640
the leader of several projects i was on

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,719
the board i've i've been on an employee

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,160
for owasp i've done a whole bunch of

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,120
things

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,320
i have 20 plus years of using free libra

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,640
and open source software as well as uh

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,760
linux

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,680
as you notice the gopher on the intro

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,160
slide i'm a go fanboy that's what i like

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,800
to write my programs in these days and i

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,119
do have a second degree black belt and

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,920
edon in tongsudo miguel which is a

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,360
korean

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,400
um

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,880
version of karate

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,040
so the money shot right everybody loves

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,280
the money shot and this was me doing my

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,200
board break for my second degree black

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,880
belt

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,720
what was that two years ago three years

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,479
ago two years ago i think i don't know

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,320
this whole covet thing is completely

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,560
ruined my sense of time

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,640
uh but everybody loves the money shot

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,240
right

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,240
no one really talks about the anti-money

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,400
shot and and i'm going to be real honest

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,680
with you there's going to be some work

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,280
here like it will take some work to do

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,880
automation you're not gonna push an easy

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
button and just have it

49
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,360
but

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,360
you do get the money shot if you put in

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,600
the work so it is worth the effort right

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,119
so there's gonna be

53
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,520
a little bit a little bit of uh effort

54
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,119
right to get this done but there will

55
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,079
definitely be a payoff as well

56
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,240
so let's briefly talk about traditional

57
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,360
appsec and i kind of in this deck i i do

58
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,200
devops devsecops appsx security i mix it

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,840
all up it's all kind of the same to me

60
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,679
so if you if you see the terms shifting

61
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,000
around that's really what that is i try

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
to keep it loose because my background

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,680
is obviously very heavily in appsec but

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,280
this applies across all the different

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,760
security disciplines

66
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,040
so there you go

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,640
what to me it feels like when i'm

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,160
running what i would call traditional

69
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,400
apsec tooling right it's like jousting

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,720
with snails it is painful it's slow and

71
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,680
it's usually not particularly effective

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,160
right run this thing it's in a server

73
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,319
off by itself i got to get the results i

74
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,640
got to take it out as a pdf i gotta

75
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,959
email that somebody it's just awful like

76
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,599
i i i don't like that um

77
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
and i quite honestly think that

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
traditional apsec

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,360
was died and buried many years ago

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,200
we hardly got to know it and i'm kind of

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,120
glad to see it go because i don't think

82
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,480
we were serving

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,879
our constituency very well

84
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,280
and in fact to be really honest

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,959
i think we weren't doing very well by

86
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,360
the developers either and or any kind of

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,959
infrastructure team right where you run

88
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,040
a security tool you generate a pdf and

89
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,640
you throw it over the wall right this is

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,200
the same problem that devops was saying

91
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
they wanted a fix of developers throwing

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,599
code over the wall well we threw pdfs

93
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,519
over the wall at the developers and it

94
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,080
didn't make things better right so yes

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
like management still likes to have pdf

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,239
reports but that's not really the way to

97
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,879
care and feed your developers

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,640
the other thing is what do people think

99
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,040
when they talk to security they think no

100
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,720
right i'm going to talk to security the

101
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,319
answer is going to be no

102
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,799
and it really can't be no there's that

103
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,840
is

104
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,879
no way

105
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,799
to make things right right it's not a

106
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,480
good idea

107
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,040
instead think about it the purpose of an

108
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,920
apsec program or any security program is

109
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,640
to evaluate the security of whatever

110
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,080
that domain is right it could be the

111
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,840
suite of applications for the business

112
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,159
it might be your cloud infrastructure

113
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,200
maybe it's a it's a a whole bunch of

114
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,959
desktop computers right it's your it's

115
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,120
your normal corporate land so to speak

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,200
whatever it is that's really the goal of

117
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,720
a security program

118
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,519
you can give informed information back

119
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,040
to the business to guide them in the

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,959
right direction right you shouldn't be

121
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,440
just the no person

122
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,240
so

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
what i like to ask and i'd ask is if we

124
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
were in a physical environment it's like

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,160
raise your hand if you have fueled the

126
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
full view of your application landscape

127
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,280
and i think this would be the

128
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,680
traditional security answer of no

129
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
most people don't i've actually worked

130
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,440
in worked with an ad a bunch of

131
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,680
different companies and so far i have

132
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,040
found one

133
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,040
in 20-ish years of doing this work where

134
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,560
they actually had a good solid list of

135
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
all of their applications everyone else

136
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
it's like we have no idea we have maybe

137
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,160
a thousand we have two thousand we have

138
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,400
no idea

139
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
so there's one more thing you need to do

140
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,919
in security to do right by your

141
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,639
constituency and that is provide a clear

142
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,280
and direct path for teams to follow and

143
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
if you're automating security and making

144
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,440
it quick and easy you can actually

145
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,880
provide the right feedback loops to keep

146
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,440
the uh the whatever area your the other

147
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,759
developers in the case of appsec right

148
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,520
on that correct path right you can

149
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,840
notify them when they deviate quickly so

150
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,520
they don't get way off the path before

151
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,320
they have to do a course correction

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,039
so

153
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,400
let's talk about security automation

154
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,479
what are the key things to be aware of

155
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,280
well

156
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,639
i don't have time to talk about them as

157
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,080
much as i'd like to

158
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,560
but deming is fantastic

159
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,600
um

160
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,520
and he said one of my favorite quotes of

161
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,000
his is spending time optimizing anything

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,160
other than the critical resource is an

163
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,479
illusion the idea being is if you're

164
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,400
optimizing something that isn't the

165
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,680
bottleneck

166
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,360
you're just making new bottlenecks in

167
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
new places you're not actually fixing

168
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,039
the problem

169
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,600
and my supposition is that people

170
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
particularly in the security field are

171
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
your critical resource i have yet to be

172
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,280
in a security team where they had too

173
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,400
many people

174
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,199
and not enough work right you the ratio

175
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,360
of an apsec person to a dev team is

176
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,759
usually one to a hundred ish

177
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,080
um even traditional security is a

178
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,720
terrible uh ratio of them to the assets

179
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,400
they need to protect

180
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
right so

181
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,360
people are going to be your critical

182
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,840
resource

183
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,639
this is why automating things is vitally

184
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,800
important right you have only a limited

185
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,199
capacity of sort of people brain time to

186
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,880
get things done

187
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
um and if you don't if you can automate

188
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,720
the things that are the brainless parts

189
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,000
of their job

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,840
you can make sure that at least for most

191
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,919
of the time your employees are doing

192
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,360
good human being

193
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,960
you've been thinking sort of things

194
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,759
right and uh just did a talk on this a

195
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,240
little bit ago in a different uh

196
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,280
uh

197
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,720
topic or topic whatever it was session

198
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
uh in this 20th anniversary with my one

199
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,759
of my co-leaders but defect dojo is kind

200
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,840
of the heart of that automation

201
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
effort right it allows you a single

202
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,199
source of truth right all of this effort

203
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,639
you're doing you can combine in one

204
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,199
simple place which is also a fundamental

205
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,360
uh thing that needs to happen so quick

206
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,680
aside what's defect dojo

207
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,199
it's an open source security

208
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,599
orchestration platform for vulnerability

209
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,199
management it'll take

210
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,919
over a hundred plus tools security tools

211
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,400
in just the output of those tools

212
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,199
normalize and dedupe those consolidating

213
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,000
them into one view of all of your

214
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,080
security findings

215
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
from there you can push them to jira

216
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,560
there's notifications to slack

217
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,479
it gives you a place to list an

218
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,960
inventory of applications and also

219
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,280
endpoints in dojo speak which is your

220
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,599
computer assets

221
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,599
and then you can maintain those lists

222
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,280
you can understand what technology what

223
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,479
regulations are tied to which particular

224
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,120
application or infrastructure

225
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,400
so i said security personnel are your

226
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,560
critical resource this is why you need

227
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,639
to optimize their work right if you can

228
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,039
automate the non-human brain things

229
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,560
because let's be honest when i'm doing

230
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
the drudgery stuff i'm actually thinking

231
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,160
about like what i have to do this

232
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,080
afternoon or oh shoot the tires are

233
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,840
really low on my car i got to stop for

234
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,000
air i'm thinking about something else

235
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,919
right so let's automate that drudgery

236
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,879
stuff

237
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,639
and not have the human brain have to

238
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,160
cycle on that right this is going to

239
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,400
drive up consistency a lot you'll find

240
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
that a lot of these automation tasks are

241
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
those drudgery things that if you

242
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,159
automate them they're done consistently

243
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,839
and quickly and they're just off your

244
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,519
plate

245
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,120
it will definitely increase the tracking

246
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,279
of work status this is particularly if

247
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,880
you're using something like defect dojo

248
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,200
to manage how those assessments of

249
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,920
security are happening and track them

250
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,000
if you normalize things and sort of make

251
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,680
concrete paths for them to flow on

252
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
you're also going to greatly increase

253
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,279
the flow through the system

254
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,040
you will increase visibility and metrics

255
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,720
because you have one place where all of

256
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,959
this security work is happening so it's

257
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,720
very easy to report we've done so many

258
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,399
assessments or we the last time we

259
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,240
assessed this product was on march the

260
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,200
4th

261
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,399
right you can do all those kind of

262
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,640
things in one nice place and

263
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
reduces friction to the dev teams if

264
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,760
you're doing things like speaking their

265
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,240
language and pushing results into jira

266
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,720
right now so like i just said talk to

267
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,399
your constituency in the language they

268
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,839
speak right so if you're talking to

269
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,720
developers put findings in jira right

270
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,320
you need to

271
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,399
give results to people in a way that

272
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,160
they want to intake them not in a way

273
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,959
that works for you

274
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,760
um i wish i had more time i could do 30

275
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,680
minutes on each one of these books so

276
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,600
instead i'm gonna do the old professor

277
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,519
thing and this is an exercise left for

278
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,880
the student

279
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,279
right but if you haven't read

280
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,600
any of these books just pick one and

281
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,440
read it and i'd honestly say you should

282
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,200
read all three all of these books are

283
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,640
fantastic

284
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,320
the phoenix project it's a fictional

285
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,680
account of a company and some of the

286
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,279
problems they had and how they sold them

287
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,320
using devops the devops handbook is much

288
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,399
more of an instructional guide

289
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,480
to how to do devops and then product to

290
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,600
project project to product

291
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,279
is a great book on how to take these

292
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,600
concepts from devops and turn them into

293
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,279
real world products because at the end

294
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,959
of the day if we're working for a

295
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,440
company a company needs and wants to

296
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,640
make money

297
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,560
and so being able to do it in a way

298
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,160
that's productive for the overall goal

299
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,000
of the company is obviously going to win

300
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,079
you some friends and positively

301
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,800
influence people

302
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,440
so let's talk about apps like pipelines

303
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,480
like

304
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,079
um because

305
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,920
years ago aaron weaver and i came up

306
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,000
with this idea of like hey cicd is

307
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,680
really cool and it's been fantastic for

308
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,000
developers why can't security do

309
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,519
something like that so i don't want to

310
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,440
let devs have all the good ideas i want

311
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,279
to steal the ones that work for me and

312
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,360
cicd and the idea around that of having

313
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,200
a pipeline

314
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,120
was one that i think is fantastic for

315
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,880
application security and security in

316
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,959
general

317
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,959
so how do you think make things fast but

318
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,480
customized right because the whole

319
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,680
reason your company has a dev team

320
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,279
is they have something special for them

321
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,720
if they could just go buy it off the

322
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,120
shelf as a canned piece of software they

323
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,200
would but they can't right so they need

324
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,279
to make it so how do you make something

325
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,920
custom but also fast

326
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,279
and i think uh like your pick your your

327
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,760
favorite vendor burrito place has solved

328
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,360
this problem right

329
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
i can go down there and i want to get a

330
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,959
burrito with chicken but double cheese

331
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,480
and no uh

332
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
sour cream whatever right i could do

333
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,040
that the next person they've narrowed

334
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
down the choices to a handful of

335
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,680
well-known choices in a path that all

336
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,360
things follow if i get a second burrito

337
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,640
i start at the front of the line and i

338
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,920
walk down if i get a third burrito i

339
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,120
start at the frontal line and i walk

340
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,519
down it all works the same right so if

341
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,000
you can make your security operations

342
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
function with a bunch of well-defined

343
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,399
steps and choices

344
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,399
you can greatly speed up things

345
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,240
and still allowing it to be customized

346
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,720
so what do we get with this uh apsec

347
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,639
pipeline thing like i mentioned earlier

348
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,480
you get much better visibility into work

349
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,639
in progress because

350
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,040
just like in that burrito line there are

351
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,880
stages right there's the pick your meat

352
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,519
pick your beans pick your sides wrap up

353
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,839
the burrito and hand it and off you go

354
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,079
right if you have those same kind of

355
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,839
equivalents for your security program

356
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,360
and understanding your assessments you

357
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,440
know what the state of all of them is it

358
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,360
isn't like i started testing on monday

359
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,120
in two weeks i'll be done

360
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
you can actually know exactly where

361
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,760
you're at oh i've done the two sas uh

362
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,440
two i've run the two sas tools but i

363
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,560
haven't run the dash yet and i still

364
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,320
need to do a manual pen test i know

365
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,839
exactly where i am with that right

366
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and as you're doing this and

367
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,959
particularly one of the things that

368
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,040
defect dojo allows you to do is break

369
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,120
out individual tools underneath one

370
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,200
assessment is you can understand and

371
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,160
track

372
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,240
where the time is actually taking where

373
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,920
are those bottlenecks that you need to

374
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,760
go optimize right as you're

375
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,040
understanding that wow that's really

376
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,880
weird we can do a sas assessment in a

377
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,519
week but a dashed assessment takes two

378
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,279
why is that right i want to look at

379
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,040
those dashed ones they're taking longer

380
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,720
why are they taking longer those kind of

381
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,639
questions can be answered

382
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,279
and as you've made your security work

383
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,680
these well-defined stages and steps and

384
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,800
choices

385
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,240
right it's going to

386
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,120
shockingly increase consistency because

387
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,480
you're forced to choose i'm going to get

388
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,920
black beans or i'm going to get refried

389
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,440
beans or i'm going to get charro beans

390
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,880
right those are my three choices it's

391
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,200
going to be a b or c i don't have a lot

392
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,920
of

393
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,320
other choices right which is fine

394
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,079
that's all you need to do right oh

395
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,320
you're a middle middle risk app you only

396
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
get dashed we don't do sass right maybe

397
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,000
that's your policy whatever it is the

398
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
specifics are much more important for

399
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,160
your business and in general but

400
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,240
that's the idea of increasing um

401
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,920
consistency

402
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,360
another interesting thing that grew out

403
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,720
of this when i did my first steps like

404
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,120
pipeline that i i would have bet against

405
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,880
was the fact that

406
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,000
we got

407
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,600
way better understanding of the cost of

408
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,639
switching

409
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,720
uh particularly at rackspace when i

410
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,639
worked there there was a lot of like omg

411
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,320
drop all your tools and go solve this

412
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,639
problem

413
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,040
well if i understand what everyone's

414
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,800
doing and what state that work is in i

415
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,560
can have a very good conversation with

416
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,800
management of okay that's fine but if i

417
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
take sally off that engagement that

418
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,639
yesterday you told me was crucial

419
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,560
that work will stop and it's like oh no

420
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,920
sally needs to keep working on that

421
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,600
engagement right you can have those

422
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,959
conversations instead of having to

423
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,079
remember

424
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,560
or like ask the team on slack what's

425
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,120
going on you can just answer

426
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,920
and the the the i found the pipeline to

427
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,519
be flexible enough to take everyone from

428
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,320
a a fresh green intern down to a

429
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,680
seasoned tester

430
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,519
and just hand out the the work a la

431
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,920
carte based on what their skill set is

432
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,760
so this is a very flexible sort of way

433
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,920
to do things

434
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,680
so let's talk about the first generation

435
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,240
of appsec pipeline and the real core

436
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,800
idea here is to look at your team's

437
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,880
purpose and those processes with agent

438
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,480
this is a quote stolen somewhat out of

439
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,600
the phoenix project

440
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,279
but really

441
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,120
you want to look at your

442
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,800
team and say hey there's there's these

443
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,040
fundamental steps that happen

444
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,800
when you're doing security work i have

445
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,560
intake right requests are going to come

446
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,959
in for you to assess something right you

447
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,880
need to triage that work which is the

448
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,959
next step i need to understand what i'm

449
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,040
being asked to do what's the right level

450
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,199
of testing what tools make sense for

451
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,880
this level of testing or the risk

452
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,959
inherent in this particular app or

453
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,199
infrastructure right i'm going to go run

454
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,800
a bunch of tests that's the next phase

455
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,320
the testing phase

456
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,079
and then i'm going to shovel those

457
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,920
results into a single vulnerability

458
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,959
repository hopefully not excel

459
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,680
hopefully something like defect dojo

460
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,360
and then you're going to deliver right

461
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,040
we're going to push those results out to

462
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
something like a grc tool you're going

463
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,279
to run to a default you're going to push

464
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,120
individual findings out to developers

465
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,440
via jira or whatever defect tracker they

466
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,399
use

467
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,920
you can use the rest api of something

468
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,440
like defect dojo

469
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,360
to do metrics right and do reporting

470
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,440
here's a real world example of the the

471
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,040
first one i ever really built myself and

472
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,959
aaron did this at a large education

473
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,759
company uh the bag of holding was an

474
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,079
internally developed application

475
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,279
it was open source but honestly we

476
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,880
wouldn't do that again and we didn't do

477
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,639
that again when we did newer versions of

478
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,320
those we moved all that functionality

479
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,120
into defect dojo so really defect dojo

480
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,079
can now handle intake as well as

481
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,560
being a vulnerability repository

482
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,000
but the idea is here is you're moving

483
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,680
left to right all the tools go through

484
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,079
this when you're triaging we're deciding

485
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,240
okay you're a very important tool you're

486
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,199
going to get varicode burp suite zap

487
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,480
um

488
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,800
white hat and qualis right you're you're

489
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,240
a low-risk tool we're only going to

490
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,279
throw maybe check marks and qualis at

491
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,279
you right you can make these decisions

492
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,360
you can base the the amount of testing

493
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,959
you do on the risk flow all that to

494
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,320
defect dojo

495
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,519
and once you have everything going to

496
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,120
dojo then you only have to solve that

497
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,199
how do i get it to x

498
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,880
constituency party uh problem once right

499
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,480
i don't need to worry about

500
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,160
how to uh push out results to jira to

501
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,959
to

502
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,880
the developers for every tool i only

503
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,799
have to do that one time for dojo which

504
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,760
is a big efficiency boost

505
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,319
the whole point of this gen 1 pipeline

506
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,559
is getting your house in order right

507
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,160
it's really hard for you to tell other

508
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,760
teams how to do stuff better if you

509
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,599
can't even do it better yourself is how

510
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,919
i like to view things right so make sure

511
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,080
that your internal systems that you use

512
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,840
to get testing done

513
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,600
work and are functional before you start

514
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,960
reaching out and trying to do things

515
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,880
with other teams

516
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,919
but

517
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,919
when we get to the gen 2 pipelines this

518
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,520
is where you look outside your team's

519
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,640
purpose

520
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,720
right and see which there are places you

521
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,760
can hook in to now start to have little

522
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,120
feelers in different parts of the

523
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,720
business that are outside of your sort

524
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
of normal testing flow

525
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,480
obviously great place to do this is if

526
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,080
you have some devops or pipelines

527
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,039
running

528
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,960
in the development side of the house why

529
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,039
not stub a little test in there does it

530
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,640
have to be breaking maybe it just runs

531
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,280
and reports back to defect dojo right

532
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,039
what happened in that last pipeline run

533
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,480
but now you have visibility in what's

534
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,919
going on in those pipeline runs right

535
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,679
depending on how you do dev work maybe

536
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,360
this is running in a death branch and

537
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
you can get early warning of issues that

538
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,039
are getting added into dev branches

539
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,720
before they get merged to master right

540
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,799
you have some interesting visibility

541
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,880
chances and opportunities with this kind

542
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,039
of a pipeline

543
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,240
and then let's talk about the third

544
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,600
generation of pipelines this is where

545
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,520
you scale your teams

546
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,280
um and try to dramatically increase

547
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,000
speed and visibility because you've got

548
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,160
your house in order you're now starting

549
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,440
to reach out to other teams and

550
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,280
integrate with them now you want to go

551
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,600
fast

552
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,360
um when you get with the 3rd gen

553
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,600
pipeline it's a great way to conduct

554
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,120
automated testing

555
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
it's run by the appsec team kind of for

556
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,520
the appsec team but honestly those those

557
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,960
feedback results are going to happen

558
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,559
through the normal path if you're using

559
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,640
something like defect dojo right out to

560
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,000
jira or whatever kind of place that

561
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,360
developers keep those findings

562
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,799
and it's a great way to scale your

563
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,000
coverage right

564
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,760
and the big difference is a lot of sort

565
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
of security purists will say well you

566
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,799
can't do really rigorous testing with

567
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,640
full automation and i would say

568
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,360
absolutely 100 totally agree with you

569
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,039
no no complaint what you will get is

570
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,400
breadth you will get a baseline across

571
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,320
if you run the same tools across all of

572
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,760
your repos that have source code you

573
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,360
will have a baseline and understand

574
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,640
which ones are really good and which

575
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
ones are much more scary

576
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,960
what it won't do because i also like

577
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,120
giving you the other side the good and

578
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,440
the bad it's not going to fix all your

579
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
problems automation won't make your code

580
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
better it'll just let you know it's not

581
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,720
good at a faster speed right

582
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,120
i would not make these tests blocking

583
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,679
and gates that never wins you friends or

584
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,200
influences people positively

585
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,440
particularly with dev teams and i like

586
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,799
to think of it as if you think about

587
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,880
pipelines pipelines create artifacts

588
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,720
right so cicd

589
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,919
if you're doing it right is going to

590
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,080
give you a deployed app at the end and

591
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,760
apps like pipeline is going to give you

592
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,840
findings and then you have to do the

593
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,520
same kind of work with any other finding

594
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,039
of getting it to the team making sure

595
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,559
it's addressed re-testing etc

596
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,840
so

597
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,320
first get the cake then do the icing and

598
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,000
gen 3 uh pipelines are really my idea of

599
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,440
the icing you've got to have those other

600
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,120
pieces in place before you can really go

601
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,840
there to be quite honest

602
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,520
so here's an example of a gen 3 pipeline

603
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,600
this is really more event based now

604
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,200
right so you have an event happen now

605
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,039
that event could be it's time for the

606
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,000
quarterly pci test or it could be

607
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,919
code just got checked into a repo

608
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,000
doesn't really matter but it's an event

609
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,799
so an event happens an abstract pipeline

610
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,960
reacts to that event to launch a bunch

611
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,000
of containerized dockerified tooling

612
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,440
right this is one of the places where

613
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,120
containers and docker

614
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,200
and kubernetes for that matter gives you

615
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,360
a lot of flexibility right so now i can

616
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,159
launch

617
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,520
on the fly

618
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,440
one or more tools pointing at a whole

619
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
bunch of different targets that could be

620
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
source code repos that could be apps

621
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,679
running in pre-prod it could be a bunch

622
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,000
of things right all those tools are

623
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,039
going to run

624
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,120
it will take those results push them

625
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,640
back to the apps like pipeline which

626
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,559
will then forward them on to defect dojo

627
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,240
where they get stored and normalized and

628
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,039
deduped right now if i want to run three

629
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,880
very similar tools against the same

630
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,280
target it kind of doesn't matter i get

631
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,600
better coverage and i let defect dojo

632
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,240
take the heavy lifting of merging and

633
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,720
understanding what's really actionable

634
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,320
out of those three different tool runs

635
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,840
even though they cover the same kind of

636
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,240
space

637
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,080
so why should you build an apsec

638
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,480
pipeline

639
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,159
well here's another real world example

640
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,440
just to give you another idea of what

641
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,960
you can do with this with this where we

642
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,600
have the developer checking in code

643
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,000
the into stash

644
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,159
right that stash is going to send a web

645
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,159
hook an event right to an apps like

646
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,000
pipeline docker is going to launch a

647
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,520
bunch of containers

648
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,400
those

649
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,720
results will go into defect dojo we'll

650
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,640
give a summary to the slack channel for

651
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,559
that dev team and then push those

652
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,960
results out to jira

653
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,400
now with this exact layout um

654
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,480
a friend of mine who was doing this was

655
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,880
able to look at 15 repos

656
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,760
over four months they had 5 100 runs of

657
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,240
that pipeline and 25 000 container

658
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,480
executions and those numbers are awesome

659
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,320
and they're very impressive but what it

660
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
really tells you is they made testing an

661
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,960
easy button right it's not this

662
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,520
onerous process of

663
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,320
days or got help few weeks to get things

664
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,400
done it's quite honestly an event

665
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,960
happens i run a bunch of tests i now can

666
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,720
get some feedback on what happened in

667
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,200
that event

668
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,480
and if you remember this guy that we

669
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,720
talked about just briefly a little bit

670
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
ago

671
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
this first sort of appsec pipeline that

672
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,760
we created what did that buy us

673
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,240
well in 2014

674
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,880
uh the this is a apsec team

675
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,440
did 44 assessments

676
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,240
we started building the pipeline in 20

677
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,280
in the in the early parts of 2015

678
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,080
by the end of 2015 for reasons that

679
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
aren't really important we lost 3.5

680
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,440
people

681
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,360
three orgs and whatnot

682
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,720
but we bumped up 44 to 224

683
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,760
and then two years later in 2016 we took

684
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,440
44 to 414

685
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,760
and lost two more people

686
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,960
right so we almost 10xed

687
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,039
the number of finding the number of

688
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,280
assessments our team could do while

689
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,760
losing people and most of this was due

690
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,120
to automation

691
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,720
so yeah that's an 8

692
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,880
840

693
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,000
increase

694
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,840
almost

695
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,799
10x

696
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,640
so in one final little bit there's this

697
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,440
really interesting uh

698
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,360
uh talk there uh

699
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,279
i guess was a blog post

700
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,039
maybe it was a youtube video i honestly

701
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,960
can't remember but it was called the

702
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
iceberg of ignorance and it was speaking

703
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,840
to how problems get hidden

704
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,600
the the further away from the front

705
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,120
lines you get right staff are going to

706
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,720
see 100 of the problems they're in the

707
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,480
front lines they're interacting with the

708
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,039
customers or your software or whatever

709
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,840
it is they see all the problems the team

710
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,360
leads are going to catch a good chunk of

711
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,000
them 74ish percent of the problems team

712
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
managers maybe 9

713
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,760
and the executives are going to see

714
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,039
about four

715
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,440
so how do you get

716
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,400
that bottom two thirds or more of that

717
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,159
iceberg

718
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,240
up to the level to where management can

719
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,919
see it

720
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,279
well you do that with security

721
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,799
automation right

722
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,440
it helps you push that visibility north

723
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,440
and the way you do that is if you have a

724
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,840
security baseline and i can say i'm

725
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,000
scanning all of my repos

726
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
and of all of the repos

727
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,080
10 of them are green

728
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,159
and six of them are red

729
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,960
that's that is if there was ever

730
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,000
something designed for executives

731
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,600
that's the kind of results you can do

732
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,679
when you baseline right how many meter

733
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,440
baseline how many don't meet our

734
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,080
baseline those are very simple easy to

735
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,400
consume metrics that make sense to the

736
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,760
executives who quite honestly have

737
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,000
bigger problems to to fill than knowing

738
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,159
that this library is out of date by one

739
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,600
version they don't

740
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,120
necessarily need to worry about it at

741
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,440
that level but they need to know that of

742
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,600
their suite of applications 20 of them

743
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
don't even meet the baseline right

744
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,679
that's how you get resources allocated

745
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,799
to fix those problems

746
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,039
and uh quote from my one of my favorite

747
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,640
movies brazil

748
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,720
listen kid we're all in this together

749
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,520
right

750
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,360
if you can have that attitude with the

751
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,440
teams in which you interact with

752
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,039
you will find that you will get a ton

753
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,880
more security work done than being the

754
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,080
no people

755
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,400
um and with automation and

756
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,080
writing that automation not only to make

757
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,799
your life better but to make the results

758
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,279
easier to uh consume for the

759
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,760
constituency whether that's your red

760
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,720
green on the baseline for executives or

761
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
here's something dropped automatically

762
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,960
into your backlog in jira right that's

763
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,799
how you win friends and influences and

764
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,240
have people believe that you're really

765
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,039
all that together

766
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,120
um and that's it

767
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,919
uh

768
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,120
happiness

769
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,880
we're all in it together another great

770
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,360
uh uh poster that was in that movie

771
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
brazil

772
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,440
um i will be jumping into the slack

773
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,440
channel to answer any questions people

774
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,440
have
