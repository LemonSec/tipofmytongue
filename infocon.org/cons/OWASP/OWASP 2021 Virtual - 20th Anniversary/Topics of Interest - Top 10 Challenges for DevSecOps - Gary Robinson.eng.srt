thank you for

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,559
inviting us to talk we're looking

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,960
forward to this uh session um my name is

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,200
guy robinson yes as mentioned 20 years

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,400
experience in software and cyber

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,760
security being a pen tester developer

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,279
i've done a lot of work with the wasp

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,439
and really appreciated our time with the

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,439
wasp i've rolled off being on the board

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,680
now at the end of last year and but

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,279
we've been involved in the code review

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,199
guide and we've been a contributor to

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,880
asvs we've done the uh 2017 no wasp

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,680
conference in belfast in apsec europe so

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,200
it's been a lot of fun working with the

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,040
wasp over the years

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,800
and what we're going to do here

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,480
is we're going to take it easy we're

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,280
going to discuss a number of

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,039
challenges in around the world of

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,160
devsecops or shift left or secure by

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,399
design or security as a service whatever

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,879
it is you want to call it and because

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,640
there's lots of organizations that are

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,039
moving towards that sort of area of uh

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,640
looking into things so if i just managed

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,640
to click my screen forward

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,360
so what the heck is this talk about so a

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,040
lot of people are moving left they're

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,640
moving into um devsecops it is hard it's

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,080
can be slow

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,920
and it can suffer from a lot of false

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,080
starts and what we've seen was

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,520
you know we talked to lots of uh

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,439
hundreds of clients and conversations

37
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,560
and conferences etc and you see the cm

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,520
patterns the same things come up uh time

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,000
and time again as companies have moved

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
from their traditional or agile nature

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,600
of working into more of a cicd your

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,320
devsecops you're wrapping security tools

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
into your software development

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,200
organizations

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,960
and we sort of saw that a lot of people

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,119
were not talking about these challenges

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,040
you know they weren't uh sharing them

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,560
and a lot of companies were thinking

49
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,560
gosh are we the only ones who are having

50
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,119
a hard time getting started here or a

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,799
lot of people were thinking well how do

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,320
i get started what's the things i need

53
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
to think about when i'm doing a shift

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,759
left

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,560
approach especially from the culture um

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,640
from the technical point of view

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,200
so in honor of a wasp we have put

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,440
together our no wasp top 10 list

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,680
sorry top 10 list of challenges for

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,520
devsecops we've seen people run into

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,000
your time and time again now we've got

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,599
30 minutes here

63
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,040
oops

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,239
thank you very much i've just been told

65
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,560
i'm not sharing my screen

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,599
first

67
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,640
hurdle field for myself

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,800
thank you for learning and so hopefully

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,040
that's my screen sharing now

70
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,000
um

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,040
so what we're going to do is we're going

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,560
to talk about these 10 now we don't have

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,120
time to go into detail each of these

74
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
types of challenges could be a two or

75
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,480
three hour conversation over a few pints

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,920
so we're going to skim

77
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,760
to cover the top of them they are really

78
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,319
to drive conversations they are to make

79
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,319
you think about are we covering this

80
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,480
sort of angle are we seeing that type of

81
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,840
pattern that sort of challenge in our

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,480
own organization and other ways we can

83
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,160
move around that there there are a

84
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,319
number of blogs we and other

85
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,840
organizations that will have on this

86
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,319
sort of area so do your research look it

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,760
up and see if there's other ways and

88
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
other solutions out there whenever you

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,200
want to try and get some of those things

90
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,080
solved but we've got around about two

91
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
minutes each for the

92
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,640
uh each of the ten uh challenges we'll

93
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,239
go into that there and we'll see if we

94
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,200
get some

95
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,360
information passed on so just to be able

96
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,239
to click my screen again

97
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,560
challenge number one is starting in the

98
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,799
right way planning your approach

99
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,200
we see lots of organizations that

100
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,000
um have the thought process that well if

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,239
i'm going to shift left let's get

102
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,400
started let's just take a tool or take

103
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,440
something

104
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,640
wrap it into our process or our ci cd

105
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,879
and hook the api up and then

106
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,640
that's job done you know we've started

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,599
with made progress and that is a way to

108
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,720
get a

109
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,879
um tool wrapped in but it's not a depth

110
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,959
like upstairs shift left approach we see

111
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,400
lots of people running into issues with

112
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
that and we'll cover a lot of that in

113
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,840
this talk but

114
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,360
one of the first things to think about

115
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,360
is what is the aim

116
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,959
why are you doing this here we've seen

117
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,120
organizations almost do the automation

118
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,879
for automation's sake

119
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,760
without with losing track of the really

120
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,360
you know devsecops is all about the

121
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,799
efficiency it's all about automation

122
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,400
it's all about taking away tasks

123
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,160
but at the end of the day it's a

124
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,918
risk-driven approach it's something

125
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,880
that's trying to find new issues in your

126
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,560
pipelines in your

127
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,199
code or libraries etc as it's going

128
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,040
through before it goes to release that

129
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,600
is one of the main aims we see people

130
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,360
have whenever they try to break down

131
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
deficit cops and shift left into a

132
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,440
single thing what are you trying to do

133
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,280
and it's worth just thinking about that

134
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,360
and making sure it's almost at the top

135
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
of your design or your programs

136
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,080
that this is all about finding new

137
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,479
issues and dealing with them effectively

138
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,240
and quickly it's not about taking your

139
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
15 favorite tools and wrapping them in

140
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,080
it's not about having a cool ui or a

141
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
backlog it's about you know the end

142
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,280
result which is are we finding issues

143
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,240
you know

144
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,960
think about your your devsecops approach

145
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,720
from a wider point of view you might

146
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,759
start with one or two tools eventually

147
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,880
you're going to drag into plenty of

148
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,520
other tools so as you get more and more

149
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,720
tools be them commercial or sometimes

150
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,280
open source sometimes custom things

151
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
custom scripts you put together

152
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,160
think about the people consuming that

153
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,960
they don't want 25 different screens or

154
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,039
outputs to look at make it easy for

155
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,800
everybody to work together

156
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
you know it's all about saving times

157
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,639
and tasks and as we say at the bottom

158
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,320
here um i don't know if this translates

159
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,000
outside the uk and it's a definite

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,720
saying we have here but well and dogs

161
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
not on devsecops but a devsecops program

162
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,919
is for life think about the longevity

163
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,600
think about what that's going to look

164
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,759
like in one year in two years and five

165
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,800
years time what does that need to

166
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,400
bring into your considerations when

167
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,639
you're starting your dev cycles process

168
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,080
because you don't want something that

169
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,520
you've created and start using in the

170
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,000
next four to six months to suddenly be a

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
blocker to change to be that more mature

172
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,800
devsecops process you're going to use in

173
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,199
the future

174
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,479
challenge number two

175
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,360
is

176
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,160
fit security into your ci cd if you can

177
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,919
obviously there might be some projects

178
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,639
maybe not using cicd yet you might have

179
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,400
different projects different teams using

180
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,039
ci cd in different ways but if you think

181
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,360
about your devsec option you shift left

182
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,919
fitting into the cicd processes

183
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,240
and fitting into the spirit

184
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,360
of the cicd processes that will help you

185
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
move forward a lot quicker you know it's

186
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,280
not just about taking an api of some

187
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,000
tool hooking that into after the build

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,160
phase and then send us done because

189
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,319
we've talked to a lot of organizations

190
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,120
who

191
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
have done exactly that

192
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,240
but the result is that they have some

193
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,479
cool tools often the right-hand side

194
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,199
here which collect lots of security

195
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,479
issues and find lots of things as it's

196
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,160
going through the pipeline

197
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,560
because it's not wrapped into the spirit

198
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,639
of cicd which means passing the

199
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,880
information back allowing the cicd

200
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,479
system to make some decisions based on

201
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,919
those outputs of 1 2 10 15 different

202
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,199
tools

203
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,039
you then end up with this nice

204
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,800
system you're paying for

205
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
that's collecting lots of issues but

206
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,800
nobody's looking at it it's not fading

207
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
automatically back into your overall

208
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,880
processes maybe somebody's going to

209
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,680
check

210
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
every couple of weeks or once a month or

211
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,000
whatever what the issues are there but

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,080
that's not really shifting left that's

213
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,639
you may as well run the test uh you know

214
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,840
once a month then there's no point in

215
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,680
wrapping it into your automation

216
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,759
no embrace your automation think about

217
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,639
the automation around your automated

218
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,800
tools because a lot of times when things

219
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,039
are going to fall down it's because of

220
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,440
those manual steps in and around the

221
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,199
automated tools so

222
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,960
is there an is there a manual task is

223
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,440
there something somebody needs to do

224
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,919
to kick off some of the tools

225
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,440
does somebody need to run around with a

226
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,599
spreadsheet after they've run and

227
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,720
collect all the different results

228
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,800
together and try and do some triage and

229
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
is there a way to understand across

230
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,120
20 30 different tools that maybe have 10

231
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,840
to 100 different seg to whatever that is

232
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,680
is there a way to quickly understand in

233
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,000
this release here's the brand new change

234
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,599
here's the issues that were fixed and

235
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,120
here's the issues that have just been

236
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
appearing because again that's what you

237
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,879
want to understand you don't want to say

238
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,800
right we've still got 400 issues that we

239
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,280
knew about over the last few months you

240
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,479
know the question you really want to

241
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,879
understand is what's brand new as we're

242
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,120
running through this pipeline

243
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,000
and be expecting to be agile with your

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,799
devsecops as i say you'll start it off

245
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,719
with a couple of tools

246
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,479
you'll realize those tools have given us

247
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,039
certain bits of coverage and asvs has

248
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,320
been mentioned a few times here the

249
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,800
eowasp application security verification

250
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,399
standard which is a really good

251
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,519
technical list of 300 odd controls that

252
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,360
you would want to be matching your

253
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,279
security against and if you take a

254
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,720
couple of tools and say right well we're

255
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,760
covering

256
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,560
10 20 30 of those controls you'll start

257
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,959
layering on other tools that will then

258
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,120
make you have more controls but that's

259
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,880
bringing it into your automation so be

260
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,279
expecting whatever you're designing in

261
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,680
terms of depth cyclops shift left that

262
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,160
the tools are going to increase and the

263
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,680
tools are not the knob they're not the

264
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,480
nebulous of your devsig ops process your

265
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,000
process has to be standard has to be

266
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,080
consistent has to be repeatable

267
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,480
regardless of what tools come in on top

268
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
of that so have that way of thinking

269
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,519
about how it's going to fit into ci cd

270
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,120
and be aware of your friends if if we're

271
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,279
talking here to security people

272
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,480
and there's obviously developers

273
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,160
involved in the operations teams who run

274
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
the cicd

275
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,920
the cicd team are not going to implement

276
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,399
thousands of lines of code inside their

277
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,800
circle ci or sure devops or github

278
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,600
actions whatever to facilitate security

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,360
that is just not going to happen that's

280
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,680
going to be unmanageable and eventually

281
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,320
ends up being a sort of devsec up shift

282
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,600
left platform being engineered inside

283
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,839
something like python or by scripts or

284
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,959
whatever it is inside your ci cd systems

285
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,360
that's unmanageable and it becomes very

286
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,040
hard to maintain going forward and

287
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
actually ends up slowing everything down

288
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,399
and that's if

289
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,800
and that's if you're able to get to see

290
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
the devops team to actually create it in

291
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,720
the first place because of all the

292
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,079
different pressures they have of

293
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,600
developer philosophy and digital

294
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,839
transformation and all this uh agile

295
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,959
devops you know security is usually not

296
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,360
unfortunately at the front of the queue

297
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
when it comes to trying to do changes

298
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,079
inside cicd so be aware of what you can

299
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,120
do outside of code implemented inside

300
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,040
the ci cd to make it a lot easier for

301
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,959
that to be to be working

302
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,320
because also if you've got different

303
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
projects different teams and different

304
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,120
forms of cicd we've seen people who have

305
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,200
got four or five different uh

306
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,079
implementations or vendors of cicd you

307
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,519
don't want to be doing that different

308
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,160
ways each time for each team

309
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,839
as you say here down to the bottom

310
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,000
automate automated automate i'll be at

311
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,839
100 the process and then automate the

312
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,560
rest there is always

313
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,040
more thinking to be done of what tasks

314
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,880
can be automated because

315
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,360
if you know the automation

316
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,320
is beautiful because a it takes away

317
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
those manual tasks typically from the

318
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,880
security team i know we are all in an

319
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,399
industry which is trying to move

320
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,959
security more into development but

321
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,360
taking those manual tasks again kicking

322
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,519
off tools bringing together results

323
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,680
triaging maybe even communicating or

324
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,959
having a system a record of these

325
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,279
different results etc trying to move all

326
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,720
that into development just doesn't

327
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
really match up that well so the more

328
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,640
automation you can provide that delivers

329
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,560
the functionality and the

330
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,920
benefits you want

331
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,600
that's all better so we always see

332
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,720
people just

333
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,480
chipping away at the the various tasks

334
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,440
you know they ought to be at something

335
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,760
then they realize okay somebody has to

336
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
get involved here somebody's you know

337
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,040
checking the results or somebody's

338
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,560
having to move across a couple of issues

339
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,839
here work towards increasing over time

340
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,440
that automation as much as you can

341
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,880
reduce the issues don't increase that's

342
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,480
always one for the for the development

343
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,839
teams you know

344
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,920
you never find a developer who will be

345
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,880
happy that suddenly whenever four or

346
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,639
five or ten tools are hooked into their

347
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,800
cicd system that they're getting

348
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,720
hundreds of issues pushed back to them

349
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
and being told to do something

350
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,480
especially as we have seen with some

351
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,079
reference architectures or some systems

352
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,040
that do

353
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,120
implement devsecops platforms to bring

354
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,639
these tools together

355
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,560
sometimes they're designed in such a way

356
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,360
that

357
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,680
it will feel the build in the existence

358
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,000
of any security issue

359
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
now for a lot of people here involved in

360
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,240
security i don't know i've ever seen any

361
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,160
project that has absolutely zero

362
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,920
security vulnerabilities there's always

363
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,079
a backlog different priorities and

364
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,680
different maybe uh ways of working them

365
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,519
down but there's always going to be

366
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,639
issues

367
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,320
so if you get to a point of thinking

368
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,240
well we're going to design a system that

369
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,320
will stop the cicd build on the

370
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,480
existence of an issue rather than the

371
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,800
priority whatever it's just not going to

372
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
fly it needs to be something has a way

373
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,200
of understanding how those issues are

374
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,959
going to be prioritized

375
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,560
and if you can have a way as you

376
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,399
mentioned before

377
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,200
of

378
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,360
dealing with the concept of a security

379
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,120
backlog just like you'd have a normal

380
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,839
bug backlog or whatever and jira etc but

381
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,480
if you understand beforehand we had

382
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,000
a couple hundred issues we've got 200

383
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,920
issues in our security backlog we're

384
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,760
going to run these security tools again

385
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,279
through the cicd system and at the end

386
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,240
we've got 202 issues now what you want

387
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
to do is focus on those two issues

388
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
that's the main nub of what you are

389
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
doing with the staffs like gob system we

390
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,839
already have the 200 issues understood

391
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,440
hopefully they've been triaged hopefully

392
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,880
they've been understood hopefully

393
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,639
they'll probably replicate it in jira or

394
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,320
something like that it's the two new

395
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,160
issues you want to be able to focus in

396
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,240
on and you want to have it direct in

397
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,639
your ide or in your screen or in your

398
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,519
scicd output having to troll through

399
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,199
lots of different tools or outputs to be

400
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,560
able to find out what are the two new

401
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,880
ones this isn't going to happen in a

402
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,800
fast-paced uh devops environment

403
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,560
and do everything you can you know we

404
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,000
live in the world with the security

405
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,920
tools that do produce false positives

406
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,240
the duplicitous duplicates or even just

407
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,920
nonsense issues you know issues that are

408
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,560
technically real but we just don't care

409
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,839
about you know the sort of headers

410
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,600
issues or something that we maybe have a

411
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,079
control somewhere else so again back to

412
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,920
that automation theme

413
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,480
anything you can do to automate away the

414
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,000
handling of those false positives

415
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,560
duplicates and nonsense issues will help

416
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,240
the whole culture

417
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,760
whenever those information is going back

418
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,680
to the development teams because they

419
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,920
have less times of having to worry gosh

420
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,600
here's another 15 issues they're

421
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,040
probably all nonsense i'm going to try

422
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,959
and ignore those they get more uh

423
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,560
confidence that if something's being

424
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,719
raised it's actually a real issue

425
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,000
so keep it on time here

426
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
be aware that you're probably going to

427
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,399
end up handling plenty of tools

428
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,639
you know there's lots of different

429
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,399
tool types that are out there so let's

430
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,240
think of we've got our static analysis

431
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,399
test software composition analysis which

432
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,199
i didn't add into this slide dynamic i

433
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,199
asked rasp container cloud

434
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,360
infrastructure and things that are going

435
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,839
to check for passwords in your code lots

436
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,160
of different types of security tools

437
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
and you will not

438
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,560
start typically with all of those being

439
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
included but you will get to a point

440
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
where you'll you'll layer them up

441
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,839
because what typically will happen is

442
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,600
you'll put in a certain number of tools

443
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,959
depends on your appetite that might be

444
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,279
one two three or maybe five or ten tools

445
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,480
at the start

446
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,160
and they will be able to find issues and

447
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,759
they'll work well and they're going to

448
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,880
be protecting you before release by

449
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,639
finding certain issues that are

450
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,399
you know could be a real risk to the

451
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,720
company but other issues will sit

452
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,160
through other types of controls that

453
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
maybe aren't covered by those security

454
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,880
checks

455
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,120
and what you'll find is

456
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,440
um in your pen tests or your other types

457
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,880
of security checks later on or maybe

458
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,160
something that's reported for your bug

459
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,720
bounty etc you'll see that you don't

460
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,240
have a coverage for that type of

461
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,399
security technical control

462
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,759
and you'll think right well we need to

463
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,199
add in another tool or something that's

464
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,759
custom etc and so you will see that go

465
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,680
over time so you've got to think from

466
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,240
the start if we're designing a security

467
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,120
a devsecop security program both from

468
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
the technical point of view the platform

469
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,399
have been able to spin up these tools

470
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,240
and run them but also from the culture

471
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,360
point of view

472
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,680
expect as i said going forward that this

473
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,199
is going to have a lot of tools in it

474
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,880
and how do you scale that and how does

475
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,639
that make sense

476
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,759
because also then there's different

477
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,320
types of tools you know we all use the

478
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,160
famous types of commercial tools the

479
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,759
ones that have nice ideas and the

480
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,519
ability to create false positives and

481
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,839
ability to have nice pdf reports and

482
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,560
have apis etc but you're also going to

483
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,040
have custom tools there and open source

484
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,639
tools you know things that maybe run

485
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,639
from the command line things that maybe

486
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,399
don't have a backlog of issues so you

487
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,120
can't easily check what was an issue two

488
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,040
months ago or two days ago

489
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,360
so expect different types of tools it's

490
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,040
not going to be a depth like up system

491
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,760
that just talks to nice clean apis of

492
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,000
five or ten commercial tools and you're

493
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,599
going to think well they've got ides

494
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,520
sorry they've got interfaces and they

495
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,880
can record false positives so that's

496
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,199
where we're going to handle it it always

497
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,760
extends into like things like oh what's

498
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,839
up into things like oh what's dependency

499
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,160
check um other kali linux tools and that

500
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,919
sort of thing where there may be a bit

501
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,079
more command line or they're a bit more

502
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,319
set up to be run by a security tester

503
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,640
rather than automated in a development

504
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,320
pipeline and think about how you're

505
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,240
going to work with that

506
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,919
and also remember

507
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,840
what we see in the larger organizations

508
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,400
and always is an area people move into

509
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,720
is the need for the development of

510
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
custom security scripts or custom

511
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,240
security tests you know any

512
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,760
off-the-shelf tool i don't care if

513
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,120
you're the biggest commercial tool or if

514
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,320
you're a really

515
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,240
ingenious open source tool there are

516
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
certain types of checks that just don't

517
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,640
make sense to be put into any

518
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,480
off-the-shelf tool there are things like

519
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,000
your business logic checks that are very

520
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,240
specific to the application and how the

521
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,440
screens move

522
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,039
usually checks like things like you know

523
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,240
what's the passport uh password controls

524
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,400
authorization checks you know can the

525
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
british people see the american accounts

526
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,679
those sort of things there's always

527
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,919
those sort of checks and consider how

528
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,360
you're going to take some

529
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,080
somebody's 20 line or 30 line python

530
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,799
script and wrap that into your devsecops

531
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,640
process because that's sure not going to

532
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,720
have things like an api or somewhere

533
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
that could record the false positives or

534
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,520
system of record and that type of thing

535
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,320
remember that all tools work differently

536
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,240
there's no standardization in height

537
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,000
tools or output

538
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
systems as static tools versus dynamic

539
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,679
tools versus container it all works

540
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,440
differently so be understanding that

541
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,600
you're going to have to do some logic

542
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,480
handling to map the outputs from various

543
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,440
tools

544
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,919
into some description you want of what a

545
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,919
security issue is and how you want to

546
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,320
communicate that around

547
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,240
most teams also need different toolkits

548
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,400
you know somebody working in python will

549
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,320
need bandit and sonarqube and all sort

550
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,720
of stuff somebody working in c sharp you

551
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,559
know what works one different we'll be

552
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,320
aware then that your process should be

553
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,640
consistent but the tools will modify

554
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,799
over that

555
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,080
automate triage as much as you can um

556
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,039
probably do the first triage yourself

557
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,960
but then anything you can do

558
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,400
anything you can do to remove false

559
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,360
positives duplicates or nonsense or bs

560
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,480
issues that's really what you want to do

561
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,640
and if you win at that then everybody

562
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,240
else is thinking right we're handling

563
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,000
real issues they'll have more time for

564
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,480
the process but it'll also be you know

565
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,280
have more time sorry not describe that

566
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,559
they'll have they'll be spending less

567
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,440
time

568
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,280
triaging nonsense issues if you can find

569
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,039
a way to automate that that's a really

570
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,640
important thing if you can do that that

571
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,919
helps the whole culture as well

572
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,760
challenge seven

573
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,799
map your devsecops and shift left to how

574
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,799
development teams actually work so

575
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,520
security teams and a penetration test

576
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,840
and a security test will have a slightly

577
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,679
different mindset than a typical

578
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,480
development organization will go through

579
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,600
you know

580
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,039
and you've got to think and talk with

581
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,880
development teams and really work out in

582
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,159
design how you're going to make that

583
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,080
work and one of the examples is things

584
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,799
like

585
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,520
code repos and containers on a certain

586
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,960
project

587
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,200
can and often do change

588
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,679
so the scenario where you've got your

589
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,760
commercial tool you go to the team you

590
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,360
say right we've got to onboard you

591
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,200
what's the project name what's the repo

592
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,960
name or what's the container you're

593
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,280
using okay we're going to map that to

594
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,120
this project in our spreadsheet whatever

595
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,320
that's going to be and project a has

596
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,320
reaper way and container a now

597
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,080
after that initial setup after going

598
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
through the uis and getting that done

599
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
at some point later on you're going to

600
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,679
be changing the container you're going

601
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,360
to go to the cicd system and say no

602
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,520
we're using this image this tag now or

603
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,600
maybe we're using a different branch on

604
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,280
a repo etc

605
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,360
but that typically won't be updated in

606
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,400
the security tool or the 15 i use your

607
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
interfaces of the security tools

608
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
so how do you get the process to work

609
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,400
better that way and usually that's

610
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,080
through the apis

611
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,960
you're using with ci cd so that the cicd

612
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,600
system if they change the image and tag

613
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,360
they're using that that means well

614
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
that's what you're checking now against

615
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,760
jfrog or prisma or claire whatever that

616
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,799
is rather than thinking oh well i've got

617
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,320
you know i'm checking image the old

618
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,120
image

619
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,799
suddenly you're reporting issues against

620
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,159
a different image than they're using and

621
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,320
it's all a waste of time so be mindful

622
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,480
of how development teams are actually

623
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,960
working in their ci cd and how they're

624
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,320
changing their information repos and

625
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
containers because that makes sure the

626
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,400
security is real you know we've had

627
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
scenarios where people are reporting

628
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,400
back issues that aren't even existing in

629
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,240
a certain project because it's a an old

630
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,280
repo or an old container

631
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,240
prioritize properly and this is a bit

632
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,440
more of a contentious slide but

633
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,679
more of what we see

634
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,520
organizations you know this is a lot

635
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,320
driven by regulations and standards they

636
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
are more and more around the world you

637
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,360
know from you know new york crr 50 to

638
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,600
baffin and germany to nearly every other

639
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,400
standard nest etc are talking about risk

640
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,240
they're not talking about a particular

641
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,000
vulnerability they want to understand

642
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,320
the risk and that maps both to internal

643
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,000
stakeholders if you work in a large

644
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,440
organization that's worried about what

645
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,320
vulnerabilities to find also to clients

646
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,000
if you sell your software onto them they

647
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
want to know the risk of this issue you

648
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,440
know they don't want to know so much of

649
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,240
the cvss score high medium low they want

650
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,080
to know what's the risk of this to us

651
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,000
now if you take something like an sql

652
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,080
injection it's going to be reported as

653
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,159
high probably by every tool that would

654
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,760
be able to report that

655
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,440
but if you have an sql injection in a

656
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,400
project that's low risk internal no

657
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,480
sensitive information you've got a who

658
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,080
cares attitude you know that's not

659
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,360
something that's going to stop our

660
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,200
business from running

661
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,039
but if you take the same security

662
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,520
vulnerability as sql injection and you

663
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,200
put it in a

664
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,440
external environment millions of records

665
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,039
including like passports and financial

666
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,720
information and healthcare information

667
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,000
then you got something more like the

668
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,480
talk talk hack you know same technical

669
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,679
vulnerability probably same vs cpss etc

670
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,000
high but very different impacts so

671
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,760
people are more interested these days in

672
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,440
risk than they are in the technical

673
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,120
vulnerability technical vulnerability

674
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,520
cpss can be used to help create and

675
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,919
understand that risk but just putting in

676
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,600
high mediums lows

677
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,880
is not a way that's going to be still

678
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,159
used in five or ten years

679
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,799
metrics insights and improvements take

680
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,120
advantage of the fact that we are

681
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,799
automating that we've got lots of

682
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,400
different projects working on different

683
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,600
tools

684
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
uh releasing at different times but

685
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,919
you've got so much good data there to be

686
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,760
able to see patterns to be able to say

687
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,840
ah we keep on running into problems with

688
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,919
this type of control or our pen test is

689
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,120
on returning that this is a

690
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,640
vulnerability we can start wrapping this

691
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,880
in there's lots of insights you can have

692
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,039
there and if you can manage to capture

693
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,240
that

694
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,760
your audit people but also your

695
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,000
stakeholders will love the fact that the

696
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,080
devsecops are shift left

697
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,799
infrastructure or processes or actually

698
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,480
add a lot more insights because that's

699
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,720
then how you can start better protecting

700
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,919
you know what training courses do we

701
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,520
need to do do we need to go to secure

702
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,720
code warrior and have everybody

703
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,400
understand the authorization modules

704
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,240
whatever that may be that's a real way

705
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,480
to help focus on your security going

706
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,799
forward

707
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,679
and the last one is communication both

708
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,919
for the security teams and for the

709
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,600
development teams you know we're in a

710
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,440
situation here where what we're aiming

711
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,240
for

712
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,320
is that the developers will receive

713
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,279
security vulnerabilities a lot quicker

714
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,000
inside their csd processes

715
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,720
that will happen more often as well

716
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,640
and what you then start seeing is the

717
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,120
security team start getting bombarded

718
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,640
with questions so what does this

719
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,960
vulnerability mean what do we need to do

720
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
is telling me i need a certificate where

721
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,640
do we get the certificates from all

722
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,400
these sort of things and suddenly the

723
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,080
security teams are actually having their

724
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,480
time maxed out answering questions

725
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,320
whereas they aim with us here was to

726
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,480
save them time and not having to run the

727
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,960
security functionality so anything you

728
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,520
can do be that even simply having a page

729
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,279
that describes certain vulnerability

730
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,919
fixes how to add certificates in apache

731
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,400
or how to how we deal with sql injection

732
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,480
etc and having those ways of quickly

733
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,320
communicating those things will help

734
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,039
both security not be maxed out but also

735
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,039
means development don't get these random

736
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,640
issues in their build and suddenly have

737
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,559
to wait two of the days to get an answer

738
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,480
again you're breaking the whole

739
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,720
efficiency here of devs that gobs for us

740
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,240
so i've put a questions mark here

741
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,000
because that's uh we we're going to go

742
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,279
over to the slack channel now and we're

743
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,720
going to answer any questions anybody

744
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,520
has

745
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,919
that has been a quick run through ups a

746
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,240
lot of the devsecops challenges we have

747
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,159
seen in the industry there's a lot of

748
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,360
people i think there's a lot of

749
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,640
opportunity to talk about it to make

750
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,400
sure everybody feels in the same way and

751
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,840
they're not falling behind you know

752
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,120
understand other people are experiencing

753
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,799
the same problems if you have any

754
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,200
questions let us know otherwise use this

755
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,120
information go around do the research

756
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,960
for yourself look up the blogs and if

757
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
you have any questions please email me

758
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,919
and we can help you out
