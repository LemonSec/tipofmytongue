1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,880
i have a little

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,440
hobby of experimenting things and that's

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,960
where i come from i try to

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,759
research different aspects of security

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,759
with respect to how do you build how do

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,240
you really build a secure system

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,359
and what i'm

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,760
trying to share with you is how do you

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,960
really bring

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,199
security elements

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,720
when you're building a

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,760
system so my presentation would be about

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,359
that part

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,399
okay

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,320
a little bit more about me

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,399
i'm a vegetarian

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,280
and

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,960
i was brought up this way and i'm trying

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,280
to stay this way

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,160
i like tea i know most americans

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,920
including my own children they love

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,879
coffee

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,559
but i'm a little different i

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,879
i like tea

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,760
and like i said i'm a quality champion i

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,600
like to bring changes

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
as they fit into the system

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,559
and try to improve

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,360
the overall processes we build software

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,640
with

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,960
and like i said before i would like to

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
share my thoughts with others

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,040
hopefully there are some learnings into

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,680
those thoughts okay

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,439
let me go

36
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,799
over with the objectives i have here

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,960
i want to just briefly represent this

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,360
fact that you don't have really really

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,240
solid bridge patterns i appreciate

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,439
top

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,439
overs top 10 and they were they're a

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,079
great outline but you never know how you

43
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,079
can be bridged

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,880
okay

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
then we're going to look at how do you

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,520
bring security into your software

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,320
development life cycle most of our

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
developing our products

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,119
our applications using agile development

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,200
so i want to show you how do you really

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,680
want to how would you bring security

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,880
into that environment okay

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,680
and

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,240
how do you do or conduct a multi-stage

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,000
testing including pen testing

56
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,280
and

57
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,878
when you have done all that what are the

58
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,120
rewards what do you really get to be

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,520
proud of okay

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,239
i hadn't mentioned this

61
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,040
the

62
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
the security breaches are increasing all

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,319
the time this data is a little bit old

64
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,920
but there's a fact here that we are

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,800
constantly under threat

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,040
with some new tools or some very new

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,560
ways of

68
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
of

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,879
of of hiking

70
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,280
and they are the hacking is in all all

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,560
areas of our life banking for example

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,640
big time

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,000
healthcare also big time it has lots of

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,239
ppi so we really

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,599
have seen

76
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,000
a lot of hacking in that area

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
we have vulnerable systems

78
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,080
ransomware ransomware

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
it goes from individuals to the

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,040
governments

81
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,640
where people

82
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,200
pay or for the nation

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,920
level where people companies pay big big

84
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,000
amount of money

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
to deal with the

86
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,800
wonderful

87
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,840
ones that once they have been

88
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,720
hijacked and government itself

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,440
is an area where

90
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,159
beaches are taking place

91
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,080
what this light tells you is

92
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,040
there are

93
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,760
multiple areas where

94
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,440
vulnerabilities are

95
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,120
being exploited

96
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
okay

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
now

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,319
i explained that to you no breach

99
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,159
pattern there a little bit more evidence

100
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,560
of that i'm going to give you a few

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,280
cases where breach took place for

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,720
different reasons if you look at

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,400
facebook facebook

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,159
breach happen

105
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,480
by stolen user access tokens

106
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,239
i don't think i won't have the time to

107
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,319
go into every one of those

108
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,560
details about you anyone in those if you

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,080
look at uh

110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,480
european bank european bank

111
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,280
was

112
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,439
breached through a malware injection by

113
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,239
a third party

114
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,680
for a third party application

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,399
parameter tempering first american home

116
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,560
buyers protection corporation was

117
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,639
breached by parameter tampering

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,759
and then

119
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,759
disney was breached by credential

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,759
stuffing where

121
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,720
data was already stolen and then

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
hackers went again with their data and

123
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
they had disney place

124
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,759
right away

125
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,759
okay

126
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,400
the other fact here is they beat last

127
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,600
for a long time 266 days there is a

128

reference at the bottom 197

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,639
days before zero day and then it takes

130
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,240
69 days to

131
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,400
contain

132
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,280
contain on the bridge okay so it's

133
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,680
expensive you lose money

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,000
you lose customer log loyalty and you

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,080
may have litigations to come through

136
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,290

[Music]

138
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,639
if you look at the cost of fixing a

139
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,520
a vulnerability

140
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,800
from

141
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,280
looking at how this rises between design

142
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,320
and deployment you're spending 100 times

143
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,639
more money

144
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,720
to fix the vulnerability once the

145
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,880
product has been released so we really

146
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,000
need to

147
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,960
be aware of this fact

148
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,479
when we

149
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,000
think about

150
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
how much effort should we put into

151
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,940
design and development

what have been doing

154
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,720
most of the companies i think

155
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,600
and i have heard are doing penetration

156
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,800
testing

157
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,320
great

158
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,400
there are some things about penetration

testing

160
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,479
it's it's an art of finding known

161
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,960
vulnerabilities that's why i asked aaron

162
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,560
a question

163
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,479
if he would consider

164
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,319
penetration testing as an

165
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,120
experimentation which i think is the

166
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,980
right thing to say

especially networks

and the tools we have today

172
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,440
they're not very effective they have

173
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,520
limited effectiveness

174
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,319
finally it's way later in the life cycle

175
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,039
really at the end of the

176
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,960
when the product is is all built that's

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,240
when we do

178
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,880
penetration testing it's just too late

179
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
to fix things turn things around and fix

180
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,840
things up okay

181
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,840
to me it sounds like

182
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,680
early go with systems checking yeah yeah

183
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
we're just looking at some some symptoms

184
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,960
there

185
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,919
okay

186
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,280
what's better

187
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,440
bring in security elements into your

188
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,599
life cycle as you

189
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,599
design the product

190
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,240
and code the product how do we do that

191
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
let's look at that

192
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,000
now first why should we do that first of

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
all i just told you about

194
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,759
how long does it take

195
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,479
to contain a bridge 266 days on an

196
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,479
average okay

197
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,960
the cost of fixing something

198
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,280
once things have been

199
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,318
breached okay

200
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,800
developers repeat mistakes

201
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
some of you may not will not hopefully

202
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,319
not okay

203
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,039
we have open source dependencies

204
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,039
the code you're you're putting together

205
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,880
depends on so many other

206
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,319
other software pcs like your platform

207
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,160
there are open source

208
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
applications you may be using

209
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,919
and there

210
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,160
our source depends dependencies you may

211
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,360
give a piece of your application or part

212
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,879
of your application to be developed by

213
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,879
someone else and they're going to use

214
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,960
different techniques methods which you

215
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,639
may or may not know

216
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,319
and there's a dependency there too

217
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,440
so now let me show you how

218
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
let me show you or let me

219
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,039
explain how my ideas fit into

220
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,919
into your agile development okay

221
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,360
first of all

222
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,759
you include your security stories in

223
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,759
your backlog and i'll show you how to do

224
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,000
that

225
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,479
so if you look at the

226
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,840
cycle of

227
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,879
of a story in agile development you're

228
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,519
going to have a

229
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,399
acceptance criteria for a security story

230
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,679
you have a story you'll have an

231
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,159
acceptance criteria for this story and

232
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
then you will define some security

233
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,039
controls

234
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,080
okay

235
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
that is the initial phase when you are

236
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,040
really

237
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,560
when you have a story and you are trying

238
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,600
to deal with it in an abnormal story you

239
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
wish you should look at if there is any

240
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
security risk there or what should be

241
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,399
the control at that point

242
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,240
when we go to

243
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,600
defining stories

244
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,320
let's take a story set the shopping cart

245
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,120
total to zero this is a hacker here

246
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,959
and

247
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,240
and then the

248
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,480
the customer is trying to provide the

249
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,160
information about the credit card okay

250
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,640
and the customer is thinking that my

251
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,830
information should not be stolen

252
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,240
[Music]

253
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,800
then as a developer you are trying to

254
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,560
develop a securities

255
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,240
product

256
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,040
no one should be able to force privilege

257
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
escalation for example

258
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,560
and a security engineer you are trying

259
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,880
to make sure the overall operation of

260
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
the application is secure

261
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,760
so what i have just explained here is

262
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,399
different personas different

263
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,680
different

264
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,839
actors involved

265
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,519
when it comes to

266
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,200
taking your security in an agile

267
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,560
development

268
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,200
and they all would have a role to play

269
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,279
they would all have use cases to deal

270
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,360
with

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,720
okay

272
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,399
security engineer would think

273
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,959
website should be up and running during

274
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,760
business hours

275
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
so let's just look at customary customer

276
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
story development and we will take a

277
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,680
very simple story

278
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,079
as a user my personal information is

279
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,279
protected and not exposed to others okay

280
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,160
and what i'm also saying is

281
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
at the entry the information should be

282
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,720
protected in transition the information

283
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,120
should be protected and when it is

284
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
stationary

285
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,760
it should be protected at that point you

286
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,160
should the integrity and only authorized

287
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,519
people should be able to see it when

288
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,839
the information is

289
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,680
stationary okay so let's look at the

290
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,360
acceptance criteria

291
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
so now we have three different layers

292
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,800
here first layer is client

293
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,279
which is trying to enter the information

294
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,320
and then we move the data down to the

295
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,160
web server and finally to the database

296
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,200
okay so i'm just taking with

297
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,959
the customer level customer would like

298
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,959
to see

299
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,360
the data entry is hidden

300
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,240
when they're entering the data

301
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,279
and

302
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,279
for that

303
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,519
we will have a security control in

304
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,760
transition when the data is moving on

305
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,560
the

306
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,839
on the wire

307
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,880
we need to

308
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,120
maintain the confidentiality

309
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,519
and then when you are on the server side

310
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,680
data should be accurate integrity should

311
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,480
be maintained and only authorized user

312
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,760
can see the data it's not just the

313
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,320
user but also the processes can see the

314
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,200
data

315
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,720
so if i look at

316
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,200
further down how do i build

317
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
security controls for these things which

318
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,760
are my checks and balances for security

319
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
i would

320
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
say on the portal

321
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,279
the data should not the critical data

322
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,920
should not be displayed

323
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,760
for example and we are implementing that

324
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,079
already for example the password should

325
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:04,880
not

326
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,279
should be should be should not be in

327
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,440
text form okay

328
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
when i go to the next

329
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,240
level where i'm transiting the data

330
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,120
i should transit the data

331
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,399
through a

332
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,720
secure socket layer and the data should

333
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
be encrypted those are my security

334
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,839
controls to maintain data config

335
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,800
confidentiality now

336
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,320
we may come up with

337
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,839
with more than that this is just a

338
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,519
simple example here

339
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,320
so now if you go to the database side

340
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,040
excuse me

341
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,800
we want to validate the business logic

342
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,720
before we store the data

343
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,800
we want to encrypt the data it may be

344
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,600
same as encryption that we have

345
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,360
used for

346
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,959
transmitting the data

347
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,040
and then follow the least level of

348
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,639
privilege so i have what i have now is

349
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,560
is an exceptions criteria for this story

350
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,040
and i also have security controls at

351
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,240
this point

352
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,720
i feel like i know what i'm going to

353
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,000
test against

354
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,200
okay

355
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,480
so now let's put it all into a

356
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,880
a life cycle

357
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,200
we're going to talk about

358
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,560
the modeling

359
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,399
and the thread modeling

360
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,240
some of you i'm sure most of you have

361
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,160
seen this destroyed

362
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,880
model of thread modeling

363
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,760
so let's not go deep into that but i

364
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
just took

365
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,160
a few stories here few stories that i

366
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,399
would have mind my agile development

367
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,560
and i very simple

368
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,440
with very simple technique where

369
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,320
i'm trying to see if there is a

370
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,560
a threat or not or what's the level of

371
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,680
threat i just put a yes or no so browse

372
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,199
to site i said spoofing

373
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,880
thread is not there

374
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,120
but i think that in life service can

375
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,600
happen so with this simple scheme i came

376
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,560
up with or you can come up with any any

377
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,360
any quantify or any quality or a

378
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,279
quantifiable result where you can say

379
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,000
you can you can scale your thread

380
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,680
based upon the stories so in this

381
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
particular case

382
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,160
i i login happens to have the high

383
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,839
thread so i want to make sure that i

384
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,240
take care of that story

385
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,880
which is going to the system

386
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,120
do their web application seriously

387
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,040
now how do i

388
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,639
there are other things you can do you

389
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,800
can use

390
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,959
design and con and

391
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,720
encoding principles as well and there

392
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,959
are a few written few i have displayed

393
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,600
here defense in depth is one

394
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,440
now feel secure and talked about it

395
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,160
least privileges where you would by

396
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,240
default assign list privileges to any

397
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,560
user

398
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,320
make sure you are protecting your

399
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,160
weakest link weakest code and then

400
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,560
also a way of being aware of

401
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,079
other components like you have any

402
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,079
internal component you're using or a

403
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,160
third-party component or any open source

404
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,440
open source software you're using

405
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,199
so there's a different design encoding

406
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,560
principles

407
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,880
now let's go to the

408
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,079
the testing strategy along longest dlc

409
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,920
okay

410
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,160
there are code is based upon the kodi

411
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,800
state you have

412
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,399
raw code

413
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,720
and you have executable code

414
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,040
for raw code you can do

415
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,320
your

416
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,279
sasd design and coding

417
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,360
design review code review

418
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,320
and then

419
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,040
you can see what the risks there are

420
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,000
okay

421
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,720
for executable site

422
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,240
you can

423
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,320
do a quick assessment using scanners dst

424
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,639
you need to have formal security

425
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,320
requirement testing

426
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,120
that could be automated because this is

427
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,759
the secure

428
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,440
this is the the

429
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,720
these are the

430
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,480
the red team people who will make sure

431
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,519
your

432
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,079
your stories are are good and then

433
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,320
finally penetration testing because you

434
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,519
do want to test like a hacker okay

435
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,560
so there is your sasd on

436
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,240
when the kodi state is raw and there is

437
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,920
your

438
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,199
tst

439
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,560
when you are trying to do a

440
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,199
i'm trying to do validation of your

441
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,320
executable code okay

442
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,199
uh

443
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,120
code reviews are simple

444
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,199
they

445
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,440
they look at the develop environment you

446
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,240
see if your

447
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,560
design and algorithm is good and you're

448
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
coding you're following coding standards

449
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,759
the problem with

450
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,680
with code reviews is that it's time

451
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,880
consuming and you need an expert

452
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,319
to do the code reviews

453
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,120
also

454
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,280
you have your quality engineers should

455
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,359
also be

456
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,520
thoroughly capable of doing code reviews

457
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,959
okay

458
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,039
then if you look at sasd where you're

459
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,160
trying to

460
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,280
to

461
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,829
do design reviews

462
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,839
[Music]

463
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,679
the things like you the things you want

464
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,600
to see is either any buffer

465
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,360
overflow is there a possibility of

466
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,160
injection flaws

467
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,320
you can have something integrated into

468
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,120
your ci cd

469
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,200
tools like zab would work for something

470
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,720
like this

471
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,760
there is

472
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,640
you may have some false outcome and then

473
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,080
you may have

474
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,000
you definitely have a tool cost

475
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,960
unless you're using a

476
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,039
a an open source

477
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,200
tool or you will have some maintenance

478
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,039
cost there so

479
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,880
then we go into dasd

480
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,480
which is using the scanner again

481
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,960
and then formal qa where you are really

482
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,760
formally testing every single security

483
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,240
story for example

484
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,160
is the password following the

485
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,039
requirement i am trying to

486
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:19,760
to

487
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
put into my application

488
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,360
which is like

489
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,200
when your number of characters special

490
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,679
characters these will be tested in

491
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,039
formal qa

492
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,280
okay

493
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,520
your scanner will get you common

494
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,200
vulnerabilities

495
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
you have to have

496
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,880
the testing

497
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,559
of

498
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,160
thermal testing against

499
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,080
acceptance criteria once again

500
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,919
it's a regular process you will have

501
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,800
tools and you'll have to maintain those

502
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,039
[Music]

503
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,879
finally we have penetration testing

504
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
and here we are testing for targeted

505
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,520
vulnerabilities whatever is not working

506
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,880
properly

507
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,840
or how can somebody else

508
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,280
how will somebody else will hack the

509
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,880
system how will a hacker hack this

510
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,960
system okay

511
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,360
the other thing which also

512
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,799
should be taken care of is system

513
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,039
hardening where

514
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,919
we are making sure that the overall

515
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,080
system environment is configured to what

516
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,280
we need

517
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,400
and any default settings are

518
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,760
not there

519
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,600
in the system

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,520
any applications

521
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,799
that should not be used

522
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,559
or components of the system that needs

523
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,760
to not be used

524
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,080
they are not turned on so that's system

525
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,440
hardening

526
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,679
okay

527
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,160
so if you want to change these things in

528
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,039
a life cycle you will do code reviews

529
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,200
go sast

530
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
from there

531
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,760
code review you will find some

532
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,039
issues and those issues should be

533
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,039
then taken over to

534
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,000
your formal testing in dst and then once

535
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
you have that you go to your penetration

536
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
testing

537
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,840
where you'll be testing like a hacker

538
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,240
now how do we really put them all

539
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,919
together

540
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,480
into this life cycle here

541
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
so first of all

542
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,000
you will have your security controls

543
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,640
like i have given you an example of

544
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,880
and then you will be able to see

545
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,960
what kind of risk we are we are carrying

546
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,559
here

547
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,720
on the system okay

548
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,640
then you will do your code reviews your

549
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,960
sast

550
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,039
this all is happening in one iteration

551
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,799
then you will do a dast

552
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,280
finally you will be doing your security

553
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,760
story testing i give an example of that

554
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,400
and this is how

555
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,080
you will embed

556
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,720
different security activities into your

557
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,919
life cycle

558
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,799
let me highlight one more thing here if

559
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,520
we

560
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,679
in an agile development we go from

561
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,679
iteration to iteration

562
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,080
so let's see you are in situation number

563
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,120
three

564
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,000
and there are stories

565
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,080
which according to stride

566
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,360
have a

567
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,400
higher

568
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,640
higher threat okay

569
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,960
then

570
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,960
and then you go to next situation then

571
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,679
you find out that this is story let's

572
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,679
say for example there was a story in

573
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,520
this current in the in the

574
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,360
this iteration

575
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,720
which had a a number of let's say 4 and

576
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,320
then you go to the next iteration you

577
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,919
find another story

578
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,080
where you have

579
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,960
the threat value of 5

580
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
then you want to make sure that

581
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,360
you give priority to the story which

582
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,799
threat value of 5

583
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,080
compared to

584
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,320
the previous iteration story which was

585
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,720
threat value of 4. that's how you will

586
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
really maintain

587
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
the optimal

588
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,760
maintain the

589
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,520
the

590
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,880
maintain the the low threat level

591
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,679
by addressing the high

592
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,799
threat story first

593
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,360
i mentioned pen testing that happens

594
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,720
right before

595
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,799
once illustration is is complete now you

596
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,799
are trying to

597
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,480
to build the system

598
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,919
and

599
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,840
take that those stories into your entire

600
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,360
system now then you will do pen testing

601
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,240
there okay

602
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,559
the balancing act of validation i gave

603
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,799
you the example of how the story should

604
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,280
should work

605
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,320
how

606
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,080
you should take the stories with higher

607
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,400
threat impact

608
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,320
consider those first before you go to

609
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,840
the other story which has lower threat

610
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,440
impact okay

611
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,120
and this is exactly what's saying

612
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,360
compare stride scores of existing

613
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,280
stories with the size course of

614
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,360
untested stories

615
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,559
for

616
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,320
from previous situation

617
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,120
this is the balancing

618
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,260
concept here

619
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,720
[Music]

620
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,640
and when you test the stories you tell

621
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,480
the stories in in that order okay

622
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,200
and

623
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,240
towards

624
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,159
when you are

625
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,760
towards the

626
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,240
iteration

627
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,039
end of the iteration then you see

628
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,360
how do we have risky mitigation what we

629
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,240
just we should we should how what

630
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,480
how do we mitigate the risk which may

631
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
have we may have from the stories that

632
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
are left over this is more important

633
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,679
towards the

634
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,080
end of the system okay

635
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,080
because that's when you can look at the

636
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,919
overall picture and then you can prepare

637
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,799
yourself for that

638
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,799
benefits

639
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,200
you are always trying to push

640
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,240
the security towards developers and

641
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,840
early life in the life cycle

642
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,600
and every story undergoes a security

643
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,000
risk assessment okay

644
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,039
and we do that by establishing

645
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,720
security controls

646
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,640
and that gives an idea

647
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,919
what kind of

648
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,640
including stride what kind of risk we

649
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,159
have for this particular for this

650
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,960
particular story okay

651
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,880
and then

652
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,600
like i explained to you hijack's stories

653
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
are are paid you as attention they are

654
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,559
addressed first before the other low

655
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,440
risk stories

656
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,520
and we do testing

657
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,240
early we do testing often and we do

658
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,799
testing throughout the life cycle using

659
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:47,760
both

660
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,440
sasd tools and dst tools and then

661
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,919
pen test confirms

662
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,320
security against external threats these

663
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,679
are the benefits

664
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,440
the the biggest thing i can say at this

665
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,080
point is you are bringing

666
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,880
security elements very early you're

667
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,760
being logical about it you your testing

668
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,559
is based upon security controls

669
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,039
and what the threat is

670
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,960
okay

671
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,960
once you have

672
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,080
the threat level estimated then you can

673
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,200
try to

674
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,559
mitigate you can try to build some

675
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,159
mitigate mitigate

676
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,080
mitigation plans

677
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,799
and prepare for the release this is kind

678
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,159
of

679
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,000
some to some extent this kind of chaos

680
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,799
engineering at this point

681
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,039
okay i'm going to give you a couple of

682
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,880
sayings here a couple of statements

683
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,799
people have made this is uh

684
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,670
sorry

685
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,400
[Music]

686
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,880
liz rice she's a technology evangelist

687
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,840
and what she's saying is if you can push

688
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,240
security as far as you can towards

689
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,880
developers it's a good thing because you

690
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,039
can catch problems earlier

691
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,760
dependency graph can shift security very

692
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,720
far left and that's what

693
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,600
we are trying to hit here

694
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,440
gemanico who is also participating in
