[Music]

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,200
we'll jump right into well thank you

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,519
everyone um and thanks for the owasp

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,719
committee for

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,440
uh allowing myself and ethan to present

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,039
this friday afternoon we're super

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,119
excited and my co-worker alex is going

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,279
to be joining on the presentation as

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,640
well

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,080
so i'm going to go ahead and get right

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,400
into it so data theorem we

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,560
focus on api security web security

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,520
cloud uh security and mobile

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,760
um but a couple years ago uh i've been

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,719
uh a pen tester and before a pen tester

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,040
uh in the 90s i did some other things

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,280
that didn't really have a cool title but

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,120
i've been in the hacking scene for quite

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,320
some time

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,879
and about two years ago uh i noticed

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,239
some attacks happening on apis that were

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,399
i thought coincidental

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,239
and it turned out it wasn't it was some

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,920
pretty cool techniques that are still

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,640
happening today uh so that is the topic

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,080
of my talk is not only how to hack your

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,600
apis in 15 minutes or less how hackers

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,080
right now are doing it in 15 minutes or

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,320
less so this is more like a case study

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,840
of what i identified from some

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,920
reconnaissance and some of my friends

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,320
still in the industry uh with uh unknown

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,520
titles uh so hopefully it um and then

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,520
i'm gonna just dive right in

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,960
so

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,200
so one thing i want to talk about the

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,320
main

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,560
importance of this slide is 15 minutes

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,799
or less the hacker community and i'm not

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,720
talking about the research community or

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,320
even the professional community like

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,560
data theorem but the hacker community is

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
quite efficient they have a lot of

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,880
things to do uh whether it's hanging out

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,360
with friends uh trying to get their

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
driver's license or even that bag of

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,000
cheetos uh they're very efficient crew

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,560
and so 15 minutes for a target unless

49
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,240
you want to take down that target or

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,560
unless it's a nation state 15 minutes

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,399
it's about the maximum of time you're

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,799
going to have a hacker going after you

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,360
uh for like a drive-by attack uh and

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,439
then and that's what my first thing is

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,758
hackers hack right that's what they're

56
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,160
here for that's what they want to do uh

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,080
they do it for fame sometimes it's for

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,000
chaos sometimes they entertain

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,680
themselves and their friends and

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,480
sometimes for money now later uh when

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,720
you know in the past decade it's become

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,599
monetizable but in the 90s no one was

63
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,200
really making money off of hacking

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
organized crime was always there but

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
it's gotten even more efficient um but

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
this is something that you know hackers

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,440
are here to hack

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,480
um

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,599
but uh but it's different from

70
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,480
research um research is very different

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,400
from hacking uh security research that

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,160
is uh so one person on our board uh who

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,480
doesn't need an introduction dan bonnay

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,280
he's a professor here at stanford um

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,280
he's a true researcher he has taught me

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,480
so much

77
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,400
about the information security community

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,200
army

79
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,879
information security

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,080
market

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,319
and his students over at stanford his

82
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,720
phd students they're great research they

83
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,120
produce great things but it's research

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,800
of security it's not hacking and so

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
because i grew up in this world uh in

86
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,640
the 90s

87
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,440
the researchers are what i call

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,920
the diet coke of evil like uh many

89
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,640
researchers would never ever uh break a

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,159
law would they would never maybe even

91
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,239
hack itself which is uh which is

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,599
actually pretty easy with test

93
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,200
environments and the cloud these days

94
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,640
you don't really have to choose a target

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
to learn there's so many other places to

96
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,760
learn but it is not an evil thing to do

97
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,840
in security research um you're not

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,159
breaking any laws but when i was much

99
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,159
younger in the 90s

100
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,000
we didn't have that luxury uh it was a

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,080
hacking community there were no test

102
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,400
environments and so my friends because i

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,080
kind of call out post 2015 security is

104
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,799
really strongly and more technically

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
research based but sometimes i'm known

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,519
to be a grumpy old man saying hey if

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,319
you've never hacked anything um it's a

108
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,920
different mindset of hacking uh it's

109
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,400
about efficiency it's about

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,959
data and it's about you know getting in

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,959
and getting out it's not for the

112
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,120
intellectual stimulation it's not for

113
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,639
the researchers they're very different

114
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,519
reasons um and this is what i identified

115
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,520
with this api hack that that we'll be

116
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,199
talking about today

117
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,840
all right so before i talk about that

118
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,919
let me talk to you about some of

119
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,240
dr dan bonay's research and other

120
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,720
research from the academic community so

121
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
this i thought was pretty clever and

122
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,400
kind of distinguishes a hacker from a

123
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,759
researcher here is a great paper uh from

124
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,160
some universities of how

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,080
machine learning can be defeated

126
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,240
essentially so you and i and everyone

127
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,759
probably watching this is probably

128
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,360
seeing a stop sign it's pretty

129
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,600
international maybe the language changes

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,120
across the globe

131
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,919
but the the stop sign is pretty

132
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,280
at least here in the united states

133
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,880
pretty known to all of us we all would

134
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,039
say this is a stop sign believe it or

135
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,680
not these stickers on the stop sign make

136
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,199
certain um machine learning algorithms

137
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,600
not recognize this anymore as a stop

138
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,080
sign so this no longer

139
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,639
looks like a stop sign to some machine

140
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,400
learning algorithms and the great

141
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,800
students of these universities basically

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
did this intellectual research to

143
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
basically prove machine learning can be

144
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,919
defeated yes machine learning can be

145
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,160
defeated with four stickers on the stop

146
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,800
sign very impressive very impressive so

147
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,400
as someone like me

148
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,080
when i was much younger or maybe even

149
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,960
today

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,440
what i would do is probably not take

151
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,520
months of research from

152
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,120
very intelligent students from great

153
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,160
universities wow what i'm going to do

154
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,280
to defeat machine learning is i'm going

155
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,600
to take a stop sign and i'm gonna go sit

156
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,919
on 101. um and if you're here in

157
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,319
california near silicon valley 101 is

158
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,520
our major highway here um and i will

159
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,280
just stand um

160
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,800
in

161
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
you know the middle of the highway with

162
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,680
a stop sign and you can see a tesla here

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,000
i'm not picking on tesla um it could be

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,440
any smart automobile that recognizes uh

165
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,000
the uh the promise of self-driving cars

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
which i love and i will happily do one

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,880
day but self-driving cars will see stop

168
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,800
signs and they will stop

169
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,039
so what happens if they see a stop sign

170
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,800
on a highway

171
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,639
will they know that

172
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,360
a immature adult like myself is holding

173
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,840
the stop sign and just ignore it which

174
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,680
is the safe thing to do or are they

175
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,080
going to continue and listen um to the

176
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,880
stop sign and stop on 101.

177
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,479
um and so you might be saying or

178
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,080
something maybe on someone on tesla

179
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
saying wait listen listen we figured

180
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,800
this out we know we're on one on one we

181
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
know we're on sick we're going 65 miles

182
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,599
per hour we know there's no way there's

183
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,000
a stop sign here because we know this

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,319
highway this will not be possible and i

185
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,840
don't know if that's true maybe someone

186
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,599
in the audience does in the slack

187
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,199
channel afterwards i would love to hear

188
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,720
about more uh but let's say you know

189
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,440
let's say that's true right let's uh but

190
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,800
we'll look at this construction worker

191
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,639
this construction worker is on a small

192
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,319
highway somewhere probably in the

193
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,800
midwest here in the united states um and

194
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
they're doing some construction work uh

195
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,919
it might be emergency

196
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,360
instruction work so

197
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,160
what's the difference of me on 101

198
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,240
with a stop sign and this construction

199
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,680
worker on the stop sign right um do this

200
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,479
you know this is this is like real time

201
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,800
emergency road work and this

202
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,240
construction worker is obviously

203
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,759
stopping cars right so so this is my

204
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,520
my my answer to like the 15 minutes when

205
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,759
you're a hacker you're not trying to

206
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,800
defeat tls that's like multiple months

207
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,879
of research if not years you're trying

208
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,360
to hack and get data um

209
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,280
so so the the the point i'm gonna make

210
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,520
next will really come full circle with

211
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,639
api security because of the recent data

212
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,639
breaches we've seen in the last three

213
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,759
years with apis um it's not

214
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,080
sophisticated it's hackers running wild

215
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,160
on api security and here's what they're

216
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,120
doing

217
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
um so don't listen to me don't listen to

218
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
data theorem look at the news look at

219
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,080
the data so uh two years ago there's

220
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,639
this app called 63 red safe it's a

221
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
mobile app and essentially

222
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,680
it was in the news

223
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,159
because an api that the mobile client

224
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,159
was connecting to

225
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,719
had no authentication required uh so

226
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,360
this happened in march 12th of 2019 my

227
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,839
company data theorem we found out about

228
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,159
it because it involves mobile and api so

229
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,680
we're like oh interesting now we

230
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,320
obviously look for that con constantly

231
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,279
since uh 2016 but it was cool to see

232
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,920
that the awareness of api security was

233
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,279
getting out there as it pertains to

234
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,360
mobile or not mobile but here's the

235
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,839
interesting part

236
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,000
later that year the exact same thing

237
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,160
happened with the exact same researcher

238
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,360
here's an app in australia with an api

239
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,920
search operation the other one was a a

240
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
different operation this is a search

241
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,800
operation also in a mobile app and the

242
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,600
attacker was able to get that first name

243
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,279
last name email data birth facebook id

244
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,160
and phone numbers all through an open

245
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,880
api out there on the internet right

246
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
september 19th or september 9th

247
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
september 27th three weeks later same

248
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
attack different app same attack

249
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
different app this is heyo this is an

250
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,880
elastic search database embedded in the

251
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,920
mobile app also identified by a hacker

252
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,200
also publicized here in the news

253
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,080
december 23rd of the same year again

254
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,680
same attack api uh api response

255
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,120
operation embedded in a mobile app um

256
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,760
and also compromised first name zip code

257
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,120
basically location information um just a

258
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,440
couple months later so at this point

259
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,120
it's not a coincidence to me at this

260
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,680
point i know someone either a group of

261
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,079
hackers uh or researchers what they call

262
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,440
themselves now are figuring stuff out um

263
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,880
they're they're putting things together

264
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,279
either as a group itself or as a copycat

265
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,760
attack but there's too many attacks on

266
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,959
the api targeting mobile clients and

267
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,600
successful all at the same time right no

268
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,160
one's that lucky all the time um so it

269
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,839
goes on to the next year our favorite

270
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,360
year 2020 the year of covid um and uh

271
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,760
june of 2020 it could go on and on but

272
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,880
here's something just two weeks ago uh

273
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,720
mom this is also in the news on

274
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,360
september 17th so this uh this paper um

275
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,000
this article came out saying api's

276
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,720
lacking authentication controls can

277
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,360
allow anyone including threat actors to

278
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,920
potentially hit sensitive information

279
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
and two-thirds if you read the title

280
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,519
called this article two-thirds of um

281
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,160
misconfigured api i'm sorry two-thirds

282
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,640
of cloud breaches which is why we're

283
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,720
also a cloud company not as api

284
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,120
two-thirds of cloud breaches are because

285
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,959
of misconfigured apis

286
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,560
and i'm going to show you how that's

287
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,720
successful that's the whole point of our

288
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,040
talk today is that is something we've

289
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,600
been known knowing about 2016. this

290
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,079
hacker group in 2019 knew about it two

291
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,839
years ago and now the rest of us are

292
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,480
catching up um obviously this article

293
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
and one thing if you're into api

294
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,320
security you're probably something aware

295
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,640
of the bola attack bro broken object uh

296
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,399
something authentication it's a great

297
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,120
attack i love it very sophisticated

298
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,320
very research oriented right um and

299
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,760
that's why i'm not going to talk about

300
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,680
it today because it's not the cause of

301
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,600
data breaches data breaches are

302
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,480
happening much ha much easier uh than

303
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,800
bola and ebola is great i love it but

304
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,880
it's a researcher exploit um apis uh are

305
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,720
being breached in a much easier way and

306
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,639
you can see from this article uh

307
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,240
two-thirds of cloud data breaches are

308
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,480
because of the api so i cannot agree

309
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,760
with uh that more okay so how how did

310
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,000
this happen all right so this is uh this

311
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,160
is the cool stuff right so

312
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,279
um this is what i rece uh that i figured

313
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,600
out back in 2019 was happening so this

314
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,839
is what uh that you can do yourself and

315
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,240
we're going to provide some tools to

316
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,639
allow you to do it yourself as well so

317
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,160
um what we're going to do is we're going

318
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,480
to go to the app store um there's a lot

319
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,760
of ways to do this but i'm going to talk

320
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,920
about how to do this how the hackers did

321
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,240
it in 2019 we're going to go to the app

322
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,920
store we're going to download any app we

323
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,720
want

324
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
i'm choosing amazon because it's a

325
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,639
random name that i remembered this

326
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,480
morning there's nothing wrong with

327
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,079
amazon there's nothing wrong with the

328
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,720
app this is just just an app on the app

329
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,240
store so the first thing we're going to

330
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,399
do is take an app from the app store and

331
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,000
we've got to decrypt it

332
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,760
that's step number one

333
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,000
and here's a screenshot of us decrypting

334
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,160
it and i'm going to now share um

335
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,560
a video of us doing that so you can see

336
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,160
it in real time so i'm gonna switch back

337
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,320
and forth uh for your uh pleasure um so

338
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,040
so this is us decrypting uh the amazon

339
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,639
app the amazon app is on the right side

340
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,880
on the ipad and then the left side is

341
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
our code and when we're decrypting it

342
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
which is um depending on what

343
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,000
technologies you have or how comfortable

344
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,839
you're with it's not very difficult

345
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,839
right so decrypting the app from the app

346
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,320
store uh removing the drm something

347
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,639
pretty standard so so that's done here

348
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,480
um so that's all decrypted and now we're

349
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
going to take the decrypted app and put

350
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,839
it on our analyzer farm so i'm going to

351
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,680
go back to the powerpoint

352
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,519
all right

353
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,360
now step two is detecting uh and

354
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,320
basically decompiling the app to get to

355
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
its source code remember this is a

356
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,199
binary in a public cloud we call it the

357
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,199
app store but it's still a public cloud

358
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,680
so we took amazon's app from the app

359
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,120
store it could be netflix could be

360
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,680
anyone and we're going to decompile it

361
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
and now we're going to go and hunt for

362
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,399
apis so my co-worker ethan who's going

363
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,639
to take over in a second wrote this tool

364
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,480
called api hunter we're going to release

365
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,360
it to you all uh uh to use and play with

366
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,000
afterwards um he wrote a tool called api

367
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,920
hunter that essentially is going to look

368
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,720
for apis in the amazon app right very

369
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
simple so i'm going to show that in

370
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,760
action so give me a quick second

371
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,480
all right so here's ethan's tool uh and

372
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,959
so now what he's gonna do

373
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,680
is you can see at the top uh api hunter

374
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,160
is gonna be executed on the amazon app

375
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,959
um a little typo there and now he's

376
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,680
hunting he's uh not threat hunting he's

377
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,639
api hunting so all the apis that he has

378
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,279
identified on the amazon app from its

379
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,240
public binary are showing up here in uh

380
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,959
light green and uh and again we're gonna

381
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,160
show you how to automate this together

382
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,680
but so far we've done nothing special

383
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,079
nothing new no bola attacks

384
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,160
all very simple stuff right um going

385
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,320
through it step by step just so you all

386
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,240
know and so i'm going to go back to my

387
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,360
slides so so far we've taken the app

388
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,079
from the app store we ran api hunter on

389
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,360
it and we got some apis right all good

390
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,839
now here's the clever part this is the

391
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,839
clever part and i applaud this hacker

392
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,000
group that do this two years because

393
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
remember what i said about efficiency in

394
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,000
the beginning of this what they did is

395
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,040
they took

396
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,000
the amazon or any app today and they sat

397
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
on it they didn't do anything and this

398
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,120
is clever this is why hackers are very

399
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,000
efficient and then the next release of

400
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,399
the app or maybe three releases now they

401
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,680
did a diff

402
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,880
um and they looked at the app from three

403
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,000
months ago to today and then they

404
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,720
figured out what's new what are the new

405
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,199
apis and this is why hackers are so

406
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,600
clever the reason they were targeting

407
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,440
only the new apis in a big or large

408
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
organization or big or small

409
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,000
organization what's usually going out

410
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,199
the door

411
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,480
has a liar six a higher success ratio of

412
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,680
being hacked

413
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,000
than something that's been in the app

414
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,160
for years right and the reason about

415
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,320
that is because developers have a lot of

416
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,680
control now they can push out code and

417
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,360
the security team

418
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,199
may be behind if it doesn't have a

419
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,959
product to look at that code in real

420
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,399
time it could be missing new apis are

421
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,839
happening or they're being released out

422
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,079
to the public so if you're a hacker and

423
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,920
you want to get in and get out and not

424
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
waste your time you're going to target

425
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,480
the new apis only

426
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,600
and not the old ones because the success

427
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,959
uh rate of a targeting new apis is much

428
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,880
higher than something that's been there

429
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,000
forever so so um ethan has done that as

430
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,199
well

431
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,720
so let me go ahead and show that

432
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,559
sorry let me just share

433
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,280
that slide

434
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,839
all right so this is a demo of his tool

435
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,360
and now he's uh basically finding the

436
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,520
new apis the brand new apis uh from

437
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,039
um diffing the old amazon app here in

438
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,559
april to the one from today and so the

439
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,080
only thing that his tool is going to

440
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,960
show is the new stuff from today and

441
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,799
this is what you're going to target with

442
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,880
your attack script to go basically get

443
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,080
some large amounts of data so this is

444
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,160
all automated like this is all the new

445
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,559
attack surface bam i have a new attack

446
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,559
surface and the likelihood that i can

447
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,799
attack this is much higher than

448
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,000
something again that's been there

449
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,919
forever

450
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,320
all right

451
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,840
all right so at this point all you have

452
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,320
to do is connect to the apis you connect

453
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,799
to the apis now this is the sample part

454
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,960
the next part i'm showing you is all

455
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,280
sample uh this has nothing to do with

456
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,440
the amazon app but this is the type of

457
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
data those hackers are getting in 2019

458
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,240
and 2020. they were getting first name

459
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,840
last name username password password has

460
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,240
social security number all they did is

461
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,360
do a diff of the binary found the new

462
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,840
apis immediately connected to those new

463
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,880
apis and bam they compromise large

464
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
portions of data so that article i

465
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,559
showed you have two thirds of data

466
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,080
breaches are happening on the cloud

467
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
because of apis this is how it's

468
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,400
happening it's not some sophisticated

469
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,520
multi-step triple bank shop bola attack

470
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,400
it's hackers targeting the brand new

471
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,080
stuff the stuff that's straight off the

472
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,480
assembly line connecting to them at

473
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,960
scale and getting data

474
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,280
at uh uh that can be sensitive not all

475
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
the data is going to be sensitive but

476
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,039
the data that they're getting uh one out

477
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,720
of ten and they just need to have it

478
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,280
once is going to be uh is for their case

479
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
sensitive and so the beauty of this is

480
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,080
attack is if you're a hacker um what did

481
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,720
you do you decrypted you differed you

482
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,559
connected you extract you can script

483
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,799
that like i showed it to you one by one

484
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,320
but you can script that to do it

485
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,880
automatically and then you can target

486
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,600
literally millions of apis millions of

487
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,200
mobile apps on the app store and play

488
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,280
store millions of single page app and

489
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,000
serverless the attack target is so huge

490
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
that if you don't target one company you

491
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,640
can target thousands and millions with

492
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,400
this script and again this is what the

493
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
hacker community was doing for api

494
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,960
security um so i'm going to shift gears

495
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,640
a little bit and i hand it over to ethan

496
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,320
to talk about the science of these tools

497
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,080
we're going to release these tools right

498
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,760
after this talk so ethan would you mind

499
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,960
talking about the details of these

500
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,960
please

501
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,039
thanks so much

502
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,480
so what we're looking at here is the

503
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,159
python script that performs that initial

504
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,840
analysis that you showed where we find

505
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,679
all the apis within the decrypted

506
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,360
application bundle and like you said on

507
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,120
launch this is this is really easy stuff

508
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,720
there's nothing complex here so what the

509
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,360
script is doing we look at every file

510
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,960
that's within an application bundle

511
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,559
applications are made up of a lot of

512
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,679
files binary files sdks text files

513
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,600
images we'll search through every file

514
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
of the netapplication bundle and use the

515
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,000
strings command to dump the list of

516
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,679
streams that are in each of those files

517
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,440
so that gets us the entire list of

518
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,720
strings within each of those files in

519
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,400
the bundle

520
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,880
now from there we're going to use a

521
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,039
regex expression against those strings

522
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,600
to narrow that full list of strings down

523
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,520
to items that look like they might be

524
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,120
apis uh they have http https cool and

525
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,760
they follow the general url format now

526
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,400
we don't need them to have api or any

527
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,080
specific keywords in there to look for

528
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,679
the regex expression is pretty

529
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,760
comprehensive in that so when we run

530
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,520
this against the application bundle it

531
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,159
prints out the list of every single uh

532
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,840
url within the bundle it looks like it

533
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,960
may be an api but keep in mind this is a

534
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,440
simple regex expression so we we don't

535
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,120
expect the results to be perfect we

536
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,640
expect some of the findings that we get

537
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,159
out of this to

538
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,320
um you know maybe they're not reachable

539
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,080
or anything so that's why it's important

540
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,240
to follow up this step by attempting to

541
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,000
connect to each of those apis that you

542
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,320
found

543
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,360
so what we're seeing here is um you know

544
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,679
kind of a flow chart that describes

545
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,159
uh you know given a potential api if a

546
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,640
connection is made to that api and the

547
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,440
resulting status code is 404 not found

548
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,799
that means we can ignore it it's not a

549
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,039
real api it's not reachable it's a waste

550
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,320
of time right

551
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,480
now if it redirects or we get some other

552
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,360
type of server error those are also

553
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,600
indicators that this is not a real url

554
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
or a real api

555
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,559
now if we get a 200 to 209 that's all

556
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,840
good right that means that we were able

557
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,799
to connect successfully no problems

558
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,559
if we get a 403 which is an

559
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,400
authentication error that's still a

560
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,320
green light if we get a 403 that means

561
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,480
that we found a real api and we tried to

562
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,320
connect to it and it just told us no you

563
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,840
can't connect here without a password

564
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,880
remember we're doing api inventory here

565
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,200
so we only care about figuring out which

566
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,000
apis are real and valid not necessarily

567
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
worrying about the authentication scheme

568
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,719
of them those can come later

569
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,919
all right so another example of running

570
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,520
that python script that i just described

571
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,120
against an app bundle and you can see

572
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,799
here that pointed it to

573
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,200
an application called apollo.app and it

574
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,799
printed out all of these streams that

575
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,919
look to be

576
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,799
uh apis these are in specific for the

577
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,440
reddit website but um you'll notice not

578
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
all of them contain api some of them

579
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,480
have

580
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,400
weird formatting some of them may not be

581
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,000
urls so again that's why it's important

582
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,440
to connect to these to validates

583
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,600
sorry

584
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,080
all right so what we're looking at here

585
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,600
is the output like like montre said

586
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,520
shadow apis are a great target if you

587
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,000
want to uh you know save time and only

588
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,559
target impactful new apis and the way

589
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,799
you find these is using that same script

590
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,480
i just described to dump the list of

591
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,120
apis out of uh you know one version of

592
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,799
the application you're going to do the

593
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,559
exact same thing but with a different

594
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,480
version of the application so there is

595
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,200
requirements here that you've held on to

596
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,720
uh you know a decrypted version of this

597
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,480
app it's a little bit older than when

598
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,520
you have now and you're able to run the

599
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,840
script against both of those bundles

600
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,919
and then with the resulting

601
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,159
urls you get from each of these you diff

602
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,200
them and the diff is the net new apis

603
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,120
apis that have been recently added to

604
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,799
the application and i like a month you

605
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,240
said there was a probably a lot less

606
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,480
scrutiny on the apis that just popped up

607
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,559
in apps yesterday versus the apis that

608
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,000
have been in the application since it

609
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,400
shipped a few years ago so if a hacker

610
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
is really trying to save time and you

611
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,919
know root someone in 15 minutes or less

612
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,000
targeting these shadow apis is really a

613
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,400
great strategy to go towards

614
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,720
yeah and thank you ethan and and this

615
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,159
technique is not new um emma what ethan

616
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,760
and the team observed and what we found

617
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,960
from this hacker community and what we

618
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,159
do at data theorem is cool stuff on new

619
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,240
api tech but this technique actually

620
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
came from the 90s like uh

621
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,640
if i can date myself when a microsoft

622
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,400
and yes that used to be an operating

623
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,480
system everyone used um when they used

624
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
to come up with a service pack what you

625
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,120
do is you take that service pack and you

626
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,320
essentially

627
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,000
look at what the service pack is

628
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,400
updating in the os and that's where you

629
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,640
know to look for if there's any security

630
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,799
changes in the os and that's how you

631
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,039
know there's an exploit and if you're if

632
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,600
you're a gray hat um you're essentially

633
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,679
right a worm in the 90s and that's how

634
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,440
all these worms became successful

635
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,520
because service pack 2 service pack 3

636
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,640
would patch a security issue and um and

637
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,720
no one upgraded service packs for six

638
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,559
months and hence you have a worm so this

639
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,640
technique is not new it's just being

640
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,440
applied on apis now within 15 minutes

641
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,240
and you can see from 2019 to all the way

642
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,640
to two weeks ago it's still successful

643
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,559
so so in summary um the way to to make

644
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,679
sure you as a researcher uh can find

645
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,480
this use our tools or use this technique

646
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,919
uh uh and and and implement this don't

647
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,520
stop doing security research we do it

648
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
all the time but don't forget about the

649
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,080
efficient hacker they want data they get

650
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,880
in they get out and they do it at scale

651
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,320
and if you're on the other side on the

652
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,360
protection side inventory your apis just

653
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,600
like the hackers are doing and test for

654
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
authentication authorization as much as

655
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,240
possible um and that's that i think i i

656
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,640
