2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,880
thanks martin i really appreciate that

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,759
uh it's really amazing and an honor to

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,839
be speaking here today this is a really

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,880
an unbelievable event so uh

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,800
i'm excited uh so i'm going to jump

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
right into it uh

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,680
again my name is jeff williams and uh

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,840
look it sounds goofy but i love

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,960
software read uh david gerlenter's truth

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,000
beauty and the virtual machine for why

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,880
so

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,480
i started programming in 1983

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,480
i started breaking copy protection for

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,559
fun in 1984

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,960
and reverse engineering a binary

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,120
operating system in 1985 i've been

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,360
running code ever since

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,960
including yesterday

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,440
i spent my entire career trying to make

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,840
sure that the software we create doesn't

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,680
end up killing us

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,800
and i don't mean terminator style

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,720
what i mean is as software gets

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,760
increasingly complex connected and

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,600
critical those are the three c's of the

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,439
apocalypse

28
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,760
when those things increase vulnerability

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,439
goes through the roof

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,280
and it's almost impossible to see that

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,360
this won't end badly unless we start

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,200
doing something different

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,880
i don't know why

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,640
as a species we seem unable to do

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,400
anything about things that are certain

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,320
to be problems in the future

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,400
they're not critical immediately i mean

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,479
look breaches are bad now but they will

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,759
get really bad and people will die

40
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,880
and

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
we can see it coming

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
but we're not doing anything about it

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,479
it's frankly it's embarrassing i hope

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,799
the dolphins aren't like hey come on

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,799
humans can't you see your software is

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,479
going to kill him

47
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,759
uh and probably kill us too do something

48
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,000
so

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,880
when i think about the abstech problem

50
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,159
uh

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,840
it's been getting more and more

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,119
difficult for the past 20 years

53
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,360
uh unfortunately

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,080
at the same time owasp has been steadily

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,120
growing and maturing and i i use that

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,280
term maturing loosely

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,160
so

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,280
i'm sorry

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,800
unfortunately i don't have time for the

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,120
full story today of

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,319
of how

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,040
owasp almost disappeared forever we

63
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,640
almost died

64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,680
when early on our two beautiful spark

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
station servers were suddenly

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,599
confiscated by the data center that we

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,239
had been squatting in uh we were in

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,319
someone else's

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,360
cage

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,160
and oh i went offline

71
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
i tracked it down i argued with their

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
lawyers but we couldn't get our servers

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,599
back it took us uh os went completely

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,760
offline for several weeks while we found

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,440
someone to donate new servers and then

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,040
we had there weren't backups we had to

77
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
create os from the ground up we totally

78
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,400
started over

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
uh

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,159
i also can't tell you uh the full story

81
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,319
of how i almost got arrested by the

82
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,360
minister of i.t in portugal after we

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,080
held a very helpful hackathon

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,560
which the press reported as

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,400
hackers target portuguese companies

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,920
and i'd love to tell you the full story

87
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,480
of uh how a former os board member once

88
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,640
attempted to drive a stolen golf cart

89
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,239
into a swimming pool

90
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,080
dumping another offer into the pool and

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,680
kicking off an all-night game of cat and

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,640
mouse with the cops

93
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,239
and i really can't tell you how

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,480
unbelievably proud i am that oauth has

95
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,080
championed diversity equity and

96
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,760
inclusion

97
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,920
in security with programs like women in

98
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,599
apsack and the diversity and inclusion

99
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,400
committee and so on

100
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
um

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,040
so look despite some shenanigans owasp

102
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,519
plays a really important role in the

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,840
software ecosystem

104
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,879
i truly believe after 20 years of hard

105
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,680
work by brilliant people at oh us we've

106
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,280
already benefited almost everyone's life

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,599
oh we've influenced standards we've

108
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,519
improved programming languages and

109
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,799
frameworks

110
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,040
we've informed millions of developers

111
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,160
worldwide about security we've improved

112
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,399
tools built some ourselves and improved

113
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,600
others

114
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
and we fostered security culture and for

115
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,040
the most part we've had a lot of fun

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,360
doing it

117
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,600
um

118
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,360
[Music]

119
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,840
but we're not there yet

120
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,600
in those 20 years

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,759
software has rocketed ahead at ludicrous

122
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,960
speed

123
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,440
most software innovations are are today

124
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,680
they're launched well in advance of

125
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,919
anyone thinking hard about security like

126
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,400
you know look at server lists or any any

127
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,960
of the new developments in software

128
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,000
most

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,120
apps and apis today are still extremely

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
vulnerable

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
attackers are continuing to innovate

132
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,280
look you could argue that even if if os

133
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,759
was just keeping pace or keeping close

134
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,120
with software that would be a huge

135
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,320
victory

136
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,880
and maybe but look i'm not celebrating

137
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
yet it's mission

138
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,639
not accomplished

139
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,160
got to be patient

140
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,039
uh

141
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,280
it took decades

142
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,800
for automobiles

143
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,639
to become safer

144
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,479
and it wasn't really one thing that did

145
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,639
it it was a combination of outspoken

146
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,800
leaders exploding gas tanks regulation

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,600
court cases crash testing

148
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,160
innovative companies that decided that

149
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,120
that safety was a differentiator

150
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,880
if you look at the history of auto

151
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
safety from the time that ralph nader

152
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,759
published unsafe at any speed about how

153
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,560
unsafe a car called the corvair was

154
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,520
it took 20 years after that

155
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,759
for the first seatbelt law

156
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,400
to be put in place in new york city it

157
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,039
took 30 years for mandatory crash

158
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,560
testing to start

159
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
and it took 40 years

160
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,039
for the first mandatory vehicle safety

161
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,759
label to be created

162
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,400
that's crazy that's that's a long time

163
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,479
but here we are at 20 years and we're

164
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,319
still in the you know kind of the

165
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,479
getting started stage of application

166
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,400
security

167
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,000
so that's kind of the big picture that's

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,840
the journey that we're all on together

169
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,440
and speaking of the automobile market

170
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
we realized pretty early on this the

171
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,160
software market is broken

172
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,919
if you haven't learned about the market

173
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,400
for lemons you should read up

174
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,880
the theory is pretty simple uh in the

175
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,319
used car market

176
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,560
you won't know if you're buying a lemon

177
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,000
and that's a car with unknown flaws

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,960
uh

179
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,840
because you don't have the right

180
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,400
information right you you uh you but you

181
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,840
buy the car and you don't understand

182
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,440
what if there's any problems in it

183
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,599
that's called a lemon so you're not

184
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,000
gonna pay full price if there's a chance

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,520
that that car might be a lemon you'll

186
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,919
discount that price right and that means

187
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,160
and this is this is the key here that

188
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,680
means that sellers with good cars

189
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,919
can't get full value for their vehicle

190
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,599
in the used car market so they won't

191
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,039
sell

192
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,000
and ultimately that means that the whole

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,599
used car market is full of lemons

194
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,840
so guy named george akerloff won the

195
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,479
nobel prize for identifying that

196
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,880
asymmetric information between buyers

197
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,360
and sellers causes this market failure

198
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,800
now if you're following along hopefully

199
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,639
that sounds like the software market to

200
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,720
you can consumers really tell the

201
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,120
difference between a basically secure

202
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,639
online app and one with massive holes no

203
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,319
it's actually really difficult many of

204
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,120
us

205
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,520
make our living testing applications to

206
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,199
see if they contain

207
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,720
some kind of vulnerabilities hidden deep

208
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,280
inside there

209
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
so there's really no incentive for

210
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,599
producers today

211
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,120
in the big picture there's not much

212
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,800
incentive for producers to do better

213
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,599
security because consumers can't tell

214
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,639
the difference and they're not going to

215
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,960
pay more for secure products so you know

216
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,720
where's the incentive and naturally the

217
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,960
it follows that the software market is

218
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
full of lemons

219
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,160
and that's what we see in in the

220
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
marketplace is software that's pretty

221
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,240
riddled with security

222
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,520
there's actually a good paper out there

223
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
that considers whether security is a

224
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,800
market for limes where buyers have more

225
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,199
information like the insurance market or

226
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,840
whether it's a market for silver bullets

227
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,240
where both parties are in the dark

228
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,599
about security and there's a good

229
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,640
argument that security is there

230
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
but in any case it's a problem with

231
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,080
information

232
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,399
and there's numerous ways for

233
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,599
uh

234
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,279
to intervene in

235
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,200
markets to fix

236
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
market problems like this asymmetric

237
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
information problem

238
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,399
for instance you could create tax

239
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,959
incentives for people who create secure

240
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,440
software or you could create much more

241
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,600
rigorous government regulations

242
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,440
with penalties you could find companies

243
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,519
if they create vulnerabilities

244
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,680
you could even sue software vendors or

245
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,720
even developers for negligence

246
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,800
you put put developers in jail as a

247
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,440
criminal kind of offense

248
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
but i'm not a favor of any of those i

249
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,839
think the least intrusive way to

250
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,640
intervene in the software market

251
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,440
is and fix this information asymmetry

252
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,440
problem is to require visibility

253
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,720
visibility

254
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
levels the playing field

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
when consumers have all the details

256
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,640
about security they can make an informed

257
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
choice they can choose the software that

258
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,959
matches their risk tolerance

259
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,320
so producers also become incentivized to

260
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,560
improve their products to win customers

261
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,959
and avoid embarrassment in the market so

262
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,440
now market forces can work to help us

263
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,080
find the ideal level of security which

264
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,800
is not perfect security by the way

265
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,360
we want to match what consumers want and

266
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,720
what producers can produce

267
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,360
this same approach works at multiple

268
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,800
different scales you can think about the

269
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
whole market or you can think of the

270
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,839
microcosm of your own company producing

271
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,800
software when you make security visible

272
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,680
good decisions will follow

273
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,959
and i say all that

274
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,120
because i want to get back to owasp

275
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,920
so

276
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,800
a

277
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,640
quick quiz

278
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,880
here does anybody know what the mission

279
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,839
of owasp is today if you're on the slack

280
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,720
uh go ahead and type it in the chat

281
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,399
if you don't know what the the oauth

282
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,399
mission is i'd love it if you would

283
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,800
share what you think it should be

284
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,959
uh

285
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,640
i'd like to try to pull all the oh some

286
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,040
answers together and see what we can get

287
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,360
um

288
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,800
[Music]

289
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,680
the answer actually today

290
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,320
is that it seems to have been deleted uh

291
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,760
it's not on the website at least

292
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,079
anywhere i could find so oasp it seems

293
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,480
to me is a bit of a rudderless ship at

294
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,680
the moment

295
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,560
and really organizations should have a

296
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
mission

297
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
a mission to me

298
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,279
is a statement of how you're going to

299
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,120
help achieve a vision

300
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,279
and when i say vision i mean

301
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,920
a picture of the world the way you want

302
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,720
it to be

303
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
and actually i think we're clear on the

304
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,839
vision

305
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,079
uh

306
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,680
we're here because we want security

307
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,399
to be worthy of the trust that we're all

308
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,760
already putting into it

309
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,920
today software controls your finances

310
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,000
your health care your elections your

311
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
power grid your car

312
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,360
airplanes factories government

313
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,200
weapons your social life and a whole

314
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,959
bunch more

315
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,959
i guarantee you've literally trusted

316
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,360
your life to software today

317
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,440
probably many times

318
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,279
but i seriously doubt that any of that

319
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,720
software has earned your trust

320
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,959
but i can imagine a future world where i

321
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,600
have good reason to trust the software

322
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,240
that i rely on that's the vision

323
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,000
that's the world i want to be part of

324
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,320
but we got to step up our game

325
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,120
if

326
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,519
you know today you have absolutely no

327
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,000
reason to trust software but you do

328
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,639
and even if you're inside a company your

329
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,440
assurance case is really weak

330
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,680
uh

331
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,079
if you pick a random application in your

332
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,040
company and ask you know is this thing

333
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,560
really secure

334
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,079
you'll probably

335
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,560
see a random set of tests

336
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,639
with unknown coverage and unknown

337
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,720
accuracy sometimes performed by some

338
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,600
tool you might get a secure coding

339
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,279
standard with thousands of requirements

340
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,600
that nobody ever reads or tests

341
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,320
you'll get a threat model built on some

342
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,440
if you're lucky you'll get a threat

343
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,079
model and it probably is built on top of

344
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,440
diagrams

345
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,519
visio diagrams from three years ago you

346
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,200
might get a pen test by a random

347
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,560
consultant with two years of experience

348
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,480
i'm just not a hundred percent convinced

349
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,800
are you

350
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,680
does anything we do really matter if we

351
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
don't end up with some evidence that

352
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,320
we're defending things right

353
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,760
i'll just throw that out there i want

354
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,360
you to think about that

355
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,760
so look

356
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
that's

357
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,880
uh

358
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,959
so let's let's talk about the mission to

359
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,200
get there right so

360
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,600
here's the original mission that we set

361
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,639
many years ago at owasp

362
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,320
it says our mission is to make

363
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,720
application security visible

364
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,320
so that people and organizations can

365
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,639
make informed decisions about true

366
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,399
security risks

367
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,279
i call this security and sunshine

368
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,920
it's a mission to fix the information

369
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,240
asymmetry in the software market so that

370
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,320
the market itself market forces will

371
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,480
encourage security

372
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,399
and we've got to be realistic here there

373
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,320
is nothing we can do

374
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,240
to make a meaningful dent in software

375
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,800
security if we're swimming upstream

376
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,199
against market forces

377
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,519
i'm sorry it just will never work we'll

378
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,519
be here in another 20 years saying the

379
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,839
same stuff

380
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,639
as ice-t said don't hate the player hate

381
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,000
the game

382
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,839
and i'm sorry to say that despite

383
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,720
fantastic people doing great work

384
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,120
applications really aren't substantially

385
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,920
more secure than they were 20 years ago

386
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,320
uh we just can't fight against the

387
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,519
invisible hand in the market

388
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,199
so look

389
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,639
dozens of markets have been transformed

390
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,199
by encouraging visibility

391
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,240
food

392
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,560
tobacco drugs

393
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,360
sweeteners music movies cars vehicles

394
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,959
energy efficiency

395
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,800
vending machines cleaning products

396
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,160
alcohol

397
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,920
genetically modified foods recyclables

398
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,519
and a bunch more

399
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,360
this is an idea that works

400
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,440
there are a lot of things that we can do

401
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,720
to to encourage visibility

402
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,920
personally

403
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,240
i've been talking about the power of

404
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,800
software security labels in the market

405
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,680
since almost the beginning of owasp

406
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,079
you have to realize that even if zero

407
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,680
consumers

408
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,839
read a label like this none of them read

409
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,680
it

410
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,959
it'll still have a big effect

411
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,360
simply requiring more transparency into

412
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,120
what software producers have done to

413
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,279
secure their software will cause them to

414
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,199
improve the security of their products

415
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,279
their lawyers won't let them put a label

416
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,720
on that says

417
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,839
this product is riddled with

418
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,040
vulnerabilities and it wasn't tested for

419
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,599
security

420
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,920
this effect has happened over and over

421
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,519
in many different markets when labels

422
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,639
are introduced

423
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,440
producers get affected first even if no

424
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,040
consumers are reading the label

425
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,440
over the years i've studied this issue

426
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,959
very carefully

427
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,839
uh they're an overwhelming number of

428
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,079
rigorous scientific studies that focus

429
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,199
on the effects of labeling approaches in

430
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,639
in all the different markets i've

431
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,600
mentioned

432
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,560
and i've talked with many agencies i've

433
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,639
met with congressmen and senators about

434
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,920
this idea

435
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,079
i've uh talked to pretty much anybody

436
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,680
who would listen

437
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,279
and

438
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,560
owasp

439
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,040
has had several projects to investigate

440
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,279
this idea to explore and prototype

441
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,160
software security labels

442
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,360
and

443
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,519
people have apparently been listening i

444
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,000
am so excited that this idea is a key

445
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,720
initiative in the recent cyber security

446
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,399
executive order

447
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,360
the president directed nist to initiate

448
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
software security labeling programs for

449
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,519
both consumer software

450
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,320
and iot devices

451
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,560
that's major progress

452
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,480
last week i was invited to speak at a

453
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,839
two-day event

454
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,320
from nist focused entirely on this

455
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,399
initiative and thousands of people

456
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,079
attended to learn about what's going to

457
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,400
happen here

458
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,359
there are a lot of disagreements about

459
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,439
what a label like this

460
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,559
will look like how detailed should it be

461
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,119
should consumers create their only i

462
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,880
mean should producers create their own

463
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,039
labels uh

464
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,119
i'm right in there fighting and arguing

465
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,039
about how it should look but the truth

466
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,559
is

467
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,280
it really doesn't matter very much

468
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,160
most labels like energy star for example

469
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,960
they start out with a ton of details

470
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,000
and over time they get revised simpler

471
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,840
and simpler as people realize that it's

472
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,760
not the details that are driving the

473
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,000
benefit for either consumers or

474
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,280
producers

475
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,880
so what we put in the label is less

476
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,799
important than that we get labels out

477
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,480
there and people start using them

478
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,559
okay so

479
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,640
i want to spend a minute on devsecops

480
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,440
first i want to say shifting left is a

481
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,240
really terrible way of thinking about

482
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
what we're doing here

483
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,440
first of all

484
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,280
we need to have security in all parts of

485
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,440
the development life cycle including

486
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,120
operations all the way to the right

487
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,880
not just

488
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
shifting left but more importantly

489
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,120
shifting sounds like we're doing the

490
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,440
same thing and moving it to another

491
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,840
place

492
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,799
but that's not going to work

493
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,960
just like devops restructured the work

494
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,880
of development

495
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,200
into small pieces and so on

496
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,679
we need to restructure the work of

497
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,919
security you get it

498
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,120
devsecop

499
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,000
is about changing how we do security

500
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,720
it's not about modifying devops or dev

501
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,760
or ops this is about us

502
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,720
and how we work

503
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,080
dev and ops are fine

504
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,400
we have a chance to really rethink how

505
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,799
security gets created how it gets

506
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,360
measured how it gets communicated

507
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,480
how we deliver value today security is

508
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,960
still almost always done in a waterfall

509
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,480
way we're spending

510
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,640
tons of time on big monolithic

511
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,960
deliverables like security requirements

512
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,280
documents and security architecture and

513
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,000
a entire security pen test

514
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,520
we're not breaking down the work into

515
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,640
small pieces like hey i'm going to

516
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,200
work on click checking today and i'm

517
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,400
going to put a defense in place i'm

518
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,000
going to put automated tests in place

519
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,760
and i'm going to get evidence that i did

520
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,440
it right and i'm going to make that part

521
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,360
of my pipeline that's like

522
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,280
one little unit of work that we can

523
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,120
accomplish

524
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,720
that has traceability we'll talk a

525
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,480
little more about that

526
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,400
but uh

527
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,880
we're not breaking down the work

528
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,799
enough

529
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,600
we don't have tight feedback loops on

530
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,200
single pieces of work

531
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,000
and we're clearly not pushing value into

532
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,360
production all the time

533
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,039
so look we're not really delivering

534
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,039
value i think we have to change this

535
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,640
we've got to figure out better ways to

536
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,320
deliver measurable value that's

537
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,159
communicatable with other people that's

538
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,520
the key to being visible and valued

539
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,200
and ultimately that's the whole problem

540
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,760
that we're focused on making security

541
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
visible

542
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,240
so uh

543
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,400
let's get back to oas

544
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,640
why should you join os

545
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,360
you're all here today and so guess what

546
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,440
that makes you part of owasp

547
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,200
everyone is welcome

548
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,760
uh it's a very big tent and you know

549
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,600
while i'm talking i would love it if

550
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,720
you'd share what you get out of oh us in

551
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,799
the chat afterwards i'll try and put it

552
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,120
all together to inspire other folks

553
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,400
but personally

554
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,559
i joined oaas when it was just a small

555
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,240
mailing list with a few dozen people on

556
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,880
it

557
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,720
everyone was experimenting with new

558
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,240
ideas this is you know 2001 uh

559
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,880
building tools writing papers

560
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,120
trying new things it was i had such a

561
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,640
good time creating oas top 10 and

562
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
contributing web goat and dozens of

563
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,320
other projects along the way

564
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,799
and i always got a lot more out of those

565
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,720
projects than i ever expected

566
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,320
it's really an amazing feeling to

567
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,799
contribute something that gets used by i

568
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,480
don't know how many millions of people

569
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,799
over two decades it's like that rare

570
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,039
win-win-win where contributing is good

571
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,520
for you it's good for your company it's

572
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,200
good for the world

573
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,679
uh so i i really value all those

574
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,880
contributions

575
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,600
and

576
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,960
actually

577
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,840
don't tell anyone but

578
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,679
i am not a big fan of top 10 lists uh

579
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,360
god i hope that's not what ends up on my

580
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,600
tombstone someday

581
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,440
anyway

582
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,039
uh

583
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,480
maybe you're here

584
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,760
because

585
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,200
you're

586
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,840
seeking fame and fortune as a hacker or

587
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,919
maybe you're trying to learn things that

588
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,480
will help you in your career or

589
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,520
maybe

590
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,360
maybe you're one of those people that

591
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,200
just likes being on the steep part of

592
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,240
the hill

593
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,280
and

594
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,039
application security is at least a v13

595
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,120
so there's lots of opportunity

596
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,799
but whatever whatever your reasons i

597
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,799
wanted to share a few reasons why

598
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,080
owasp is special

599
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,280
oas can try crazy things

600
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,120
it's so liberating to be able to build

601
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,720
things without commercial pressure

602
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,280
without timelines or road maps just for

603
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,799
the love of the game

604
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,799
and there's really no limit to the size

605
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,240
of your team

606
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
one of the most impressive projects i've

607
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,360
ever seen

608
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,240
was

609
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,080
uh

610
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,240
at os when we created the first os

611
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,520
testing guide

612
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,400
mateo muchi led the project he recruited

613
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,480
a ton of volunteers to each write an

614
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,360
article about a single testing technique

615
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,159
and

616
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,120
in one month we created a 300 page

617
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,320
document that was really fantastic

618
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,960
people were clamoring to participate so

619
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,280
unlike normal organizations

620
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,120
the oas workforce is potentially

621
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,520
unlimited

622
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,440
and us can actually

623
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,799
innovate

624
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,320
remember

625
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,799
the traditional model the traditional

626
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,000
approach for apsec as it's codified and

627
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,600
tools and standards and so-called

628
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,000
maturity models has been has been

629
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,600
delivering code that's riddled with

630
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,559
vulnerabilities for decades

631
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,600
it's actually

632
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,919
it's deeply ironic to me that this kind

633
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,840
of waterfall thinking and traditional

634
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,559
apsec approach is probably the biggest

635
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,039
risk to apsec

636
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,760
osp can make bold moves

637
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,840
crazy experiments

638
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,760
but like any community we've got to be

639
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,760
vigilant to protect the cowards and the

640
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,080
haters from slowing down innovation

641
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,320
that's something obvious can provide a

642
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,679
safe place to experiment

643
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,559
and os can focus on

644
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,840
public health uh public health

645
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,000
uh sorry i got behind one slide here so

646
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,080
i was gonna focus on public health

647
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,640
there are doctors who treat patients

648
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,520
and then

649
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,200
there's the world health organization to

650
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,720
promote health

651
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,440
keep the world safe serve the vulnerable

652
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,679
uh

653
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,159
the world needs a wh o for security and

654
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,600
who else is going to try to improve

655
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,799
software security for everybody

656
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,080
governments

657
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,840
as josh corman might say we are the

658
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,679
cavalry

659
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,520
co-ops can empower communities too i

660
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,880
know for a fact that giving away

661
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,720
intellectual property is a way better

662
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,640
way to spend your marketing budget than

663
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,039
ridiculous conference booths so why not

664
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,559
share that standard that tool that

665
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,159
invention whatever become part of a

666
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,840
community

667
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,320
and os was a great platform it works

668
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,080
best when it serves as a platform

669
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,840
supporting appsec projects and

670
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,760
innovation uh os should do everything it

671
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,320
can to incentivize recruit promote and

672
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,000
support projects but i don't think that

673
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,559
os should pick and choose let a thousand

674
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,240
projects bloom

675
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,720
you can do it we're at the we're in our

676
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,360
infancy in application security here's

677
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,720
some areas that are screaming for

678
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,960
innovation threat modeling we're in the

679
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,320
stone age

680
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,799
security architecture

681
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,760
really

682
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,919
uh not practiced well

683
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,600
malicious code it's beyond the

684
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,520
state-of-the-art for the most part

685
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,440
serverless functions you know here we go

686
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,360
again new technology in advance of

687
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,400
security assurance uh be nice to produce

688
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,200
some

689
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,679
uh working on a culture of security we

690
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,600
need a lot more guidance and i think

691
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,240
diversity equity and inclusion is also a

692
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,720
great place to

693
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,799
innovate so how can we explore all these

694
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,640
ideas in parallel

695
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,360
in 1992

696
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,720
dave clark captured the governing

697
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,200
philosophy of ietf like this we reject

698
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,520
kings presidents and voting we believe

699
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,480
in rough consensus and running code

700
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,559
this is the path forward for oauth

701
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,559
should stop trying to control things we

702
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,559
shouldn't try to be a for-profit company

703
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,120
or even a traditional non-profit

704
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,799
as tyler durden said

705
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,679
you decide your own level of involvement

706
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,840
this swarm approach we can solve

707
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,679
problems that individuals and even

708
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,240
well-funded companies can't

709
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,080
and for god's sakes let's not end up a

710
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,760
training and

711
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,640
conferences company that has almost zero

712
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,760
impact

713
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,600
so look let me sum up

714
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,200
osp serves a critical role in the

715
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,960
transformation of

716
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,360
the software market

717
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
and although we're not where we need to

718
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,799
be we are making progress we have an

719
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,640
amazing opportunity to make the dolphins

720
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
proud and get in front of a serious

721
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,080
problem for once

722
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,240
uh we can break free of the intense

723
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,880
gravity of the risk management world and

724
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,039
start a new orbit around planet

725
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,200
assurance

726
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,799
you'll know we're getting there when you

727
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,880
have good reason to trust the software

728
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,440
that you depend on what does that take

729
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,279
we have to figure it out for the

730
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,880
dolphins

731
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,039
so thank you uh please follow up on the

732
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,039
slack channel that's oasp standard

733
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,360
classification and uh connect with me on

734
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,320
linkedin and enjoy this fantastic event

735
