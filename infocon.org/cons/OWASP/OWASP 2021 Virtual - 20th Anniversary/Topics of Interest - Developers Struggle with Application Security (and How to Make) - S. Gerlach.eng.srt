2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,400
happy friday everybody i know i'm in

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,320
between you maybe i'm in between you and

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,080
happy hour hopefully we'll keep you

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,599
engaged here

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,359
i also would like to get to happy hour

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,279
so let's let's have a fun get through

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,720
this presentation talk a little bit

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,080
about

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,320
why developers struggle or seemingly

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,800
struggle with apsec and some ways we can

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,960
make it easier

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,000
on our developer partners

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,680
again i'm scott garlock and uh

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,200
introduced me a little bit cso

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,920
co-founder here at stackhawk

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
uh i was the cisso at cengrid for about

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,320
three years uh i did many many roles at

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,920
godaddy for almost 10 i'm also a husband

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,280
golfer

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,000
guitar player tinker brewer like you

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,079
know you name it i got hobbies man i got

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,719
hobbies um if you want to get a hold of

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,800
me you can definitely reach me at

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,359
on twitter and on linkedin there i would

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,440
love to talk about appsec and and apps

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,400
like programs with you if you want

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,560
uh really quickly let's talk about this

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,439
appsec problem overview uh

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,920
obviously we're in the owasp channel

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,400
here we're in a wasp event so appsec is

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
really good in theory

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,640
uh but it's super tough in practice and

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,479
look we're going to talk about why that

35
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,799
is today but let's level set a little

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,479
bit and talk about some of the things

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,119
that you can use to test application

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,119
security and application security

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,360
postures just to make sure everyone's on

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,200
the same page so there's a there's a

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,960
handful of things that we can test with

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,280
one of them is static code analysis so

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,360
you've got static

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,040
application security testing which is

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,880
looking at source code you've also got

46
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,960
software composition analysis what

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,439
libraries am i using to build my

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,960
application

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,720
those things just look at written source

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,759
code

51
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,399
library versions they don't really have

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
a good context of how the application

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,479
works but they know exactly the line

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,799
items where things work so that's really

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,399
kind of interesting and awesome powerful

56
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,920
sometimes that can be a little noisy

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,399
because of that lack of knowledge of how

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,720
the application works so you can get a

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,879
lot of false positives or

60
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,200
a wall of alerts

61
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
we've also got dynamic code analysis

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
often referred to as dast so dynamic

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,599
application security testing and this is

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,120
a little bit better at looking at the

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,080
app uh the context of the application

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,680
and understanding how it works and what

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,360
is being presented to

68
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,080
end users and potential threat actors uh

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,000
it's still somewhat noisy most of these

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,519
are really hard to use

71
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,200
so they're really hard to kind of get up

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,720
and running and figure out how to make

73
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,920
work how to consume the output how to do

74
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,440
lots of different stuff

75
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,319
um

76
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,239
there are some good ones out there i

77
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,840
know of one at least

78
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,400
uh rasp i asked and laugh

79
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,319
these are awesome tools but i think of

80
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,760
them as the

81
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,159
backstop for production so if you do a

82
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,159
good job through the development process

83
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,319
of making sure you've got libraries in

84
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,159
good shape making sure you're writing

85
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,599
the right kind of code doing good

86
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,080
testing these kinds of tools are meant

87
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,239
to be out in production helping you

88
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,400
prevent unknown bad things from

89
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,519
happening hopefully and

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,280
not blocking legitimate users and that

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,959
last part is where it gets a little

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,760
sticky sometimes so legit activity

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,120
happening uh in an application rasp and

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,280
i asked and waff can sometimes identify

95
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,319
that as illegit activity or the other

96
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,239
way around and sometimes that's a little

97
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,680
difficult

98
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,040
but i want to talk about some of the

99
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,319
problems with

100
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,720
a lot of these tools and and

101
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,040
application security programs and how we

102
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,440
are as security professionals making

103
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,159
this

104
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,640
maybe harder than it should be for our

105
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,840
uh engineering partners

106
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,239
so problem one is kind of this idea of

107
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,159
the benevolent security team and i know

108
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,159
no security team thinks of themselves

109
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,319
this way but uh this is kind of how

110
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,040
sometimes they present themselves and

111
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,519
that becomes a problem uh and the the

112
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,599
hard truth of the matter here is you can

113
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,159
never hire as many apsec people as the

114
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,239
organization can hire developers the

115
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,599
security team

116
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,680
often makes this kind of whole thing a

117
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,959
lot harder in the name of accountability

118
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,959
but really what they're doing is

119
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,440
making people go slow or causing

120
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,680
interruptions because they can't scale

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,440
with the business they can't scale with

122
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,040
engineering teams

123
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,080
um and it turns into a bottleneck it

124
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,320
turns into a blocker or a gatekeeper and

125
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,240
it's not good and a couple of the things

126
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,560
that are causing this thing

127
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,440
trust issues being one of them so

128
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,520
way way way

129
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,600
before covet pandemic i don't know if

130
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,800
you guys remember the time before kobed

131
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,759
i barely do uh charlie actually tweeted

132
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,680
a thing about he's talking to my good

133
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,160
friend colleen about i'm not sure if a

134
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,680
new hire dev is in a position to

135
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,240
evaluate risk for a feature product or

136
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,680
company i think professional security

137
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
people can do this better

138
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,120
and i mean sort of right sort of the

139
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,520
hard truth of the matter is a new hire

140
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,320
developer isn't making these decisions

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,479
in a vacuum anyway

142
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,320
they're making them with the input from

143
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,840
their other team members or people they

144
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,560
work with or engineers or leadership in

145
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,639
engineering and so they're not doing

146
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,800
this in a vacuum already

147
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,039
it's just that we as security folk think

148
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,120
that they're doing that in a vacuum and

149
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
we don't have access or inputs to how

150
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,280
they're making those decisions so we

151
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,240
don't trust them to make solid decisions

152
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,919
and when we do

153
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,400
oftentimes we lack the context of what

154
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,479
they're doing so they come to us and go

155
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,560
hey should we do blah whatever that

156
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
thing is and we sometimes lack the

157
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,039
context of why and what are we trying

158
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,800
what's the goal we're trying to achieve

159
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,720
and it just turns into a yeah don't do

160
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,759
that

161
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,759
and so both of those things turn into a

162
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,560
thing that is not healthy not good

163
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,440
does not uh create collaboration in fact

164
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
creates silos

165
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,039
the way that i think about this is a

166
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,280
little bit more like

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,319
this uh i wouldn't want to put a new

168
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,840
higher developer in the position of

169
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,319
making an uninformed risk decision and

170
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,039
this is much different than what

171
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,800
how charlie phrased it maybe not what he

172
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
meant but how he phrased it

173
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,960
and so the whole point here is if i can

174
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,880
get you enough information for you to

175
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,240
make somewhat of an informed decision

176
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,560
that's a much better position than

177
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,160
making an uninformed decision or

178
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,479
not making a decision at all so both of

179
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,479
those things uh they're a little bit

180
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,000
similar but they're a little different

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,080
at the same time

182
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,840
uh the other thing that happens here is

183
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,479
sometimes to combat this trust issue

184
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,560
oftentimes security teams come up with

185
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,919
this awesome new idea and it's called

186
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,599
let's teach them how to do our job

187
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,599
at best it's misguided at worst

188
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,280
uh it continues to drive division

189
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,160
between

190
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,639
dev and security teams

191
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,479
and it kind of sometimes comes off like

192
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,960
this hey you don't know how to do your

193
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,039
job very well but i can teach you how to

194
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,000
do my job so that you i can scale out my

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,160
job uh and you have to learn all the

196
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,880
things that i know already uh because

197
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,080
you're not doing a good job at

198
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,520
engineering or something like that it

199
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,919
just comes out weird

200
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,520
uh and then what happens is we teach

201
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,759
them all these new acronyms and

202
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,479
terminology and then we go to the wait

203
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,479
wait uh did we level set what do we do

204
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,160
you know about risk and how to calculate

205
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,360
risk and

206
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,599
also you know the internet's bad don't

207
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,720
you

208
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,919
and then

209
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,840
like it's just this circle of

210
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,080
out of context it's not what we're what

211
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,479
they work on on a daily basis

212
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,400
it's not relevant to the things that

213
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,840
they're trying to do the goals they're

214
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
trying to achieve

215
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
and if you ever have done one of these

216
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,080
developer security programs

217
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,759
have you ever noticed who gets selected

218
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,199
by the engineering team to go to these

219
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,039
things so usually the engineering

220
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,199
leadership is like i'm going to send my

221
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,360
top developers to this stuff we're going

222
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,960
to do a train the trainers kind of a

223
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,479
model they're going to come back and

224
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,520
teach everybody all the stuff they learn

225
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,199
and at the end when you talk to them

226
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,680
they say it was really informative i

227
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,280
learned a ton of stuff

228
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,639
and then you come back a month later and

229
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,479
go who did you help

230
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,520
help teach this these concepts to or do

231
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,280
it in practice or things that you fixed

232
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,960
in the code base because of what you

233
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,120
learned and they almost always go

234
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,960
oh nothing i actually went back to my

235
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,800
real job of doing features and bug

236
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,599
fixing and pushing stuff out the door to

237
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,719
create value for the business so

238
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,479
oftentimes this is really really

239
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,958
ineffective there is little tidbits of

240
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,880
good things that happen in this

241
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,959
but the hardest part of this is we're

242
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,120
teaching them in these vulnerable apps

243
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,959
which are good to learn in

244
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,279
but they're hard to teach developers in

245
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,279
because they don't work like regular

246
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,680
apps they don't get built like regular

247
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,279
like regular apps

248
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,800
they don't have the context of what the

249
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
business is actually trying to do

250
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,560
like the applications that they're

251
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,160
working the things that i've seen work

252
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,839
best here are

253
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,640
take

254
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,120
a found application security issues in

255
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,440
code bases that you work on

256
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,000
and teach the development team why

257
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,120
that's bad in the context of their thing

258
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,399
and show them

259
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,399
what a better way is or collaborate with

260
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,640
them on how can we fix that and go that

261
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,399
way that really keeps them in the

262
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,560
context of here's what i do for a living

263
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,800
when we do this out of context thing it

264
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,839
sort of feels like this sometimes

265
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,040
it's kind of the equivalent of the

266
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,760
accounting team saying to leadership

267
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,200
after leadership goes hey we want to

268
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,560
model a new price increase the

269
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
accounting team going

270
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,080
we can help you with that but first we

271
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,680
have to teach you how the gl works now

272
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,080
the gl is a really complicated but easy

273
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,000
system of debits and credits and

274
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,240
everything equals zero at the end

275
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,519
and the accounting team or the exact

276
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,440
team is just like okay cool uh i just

277
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,360
need to be able to make decisions

278
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,240
quickly with the right information so

279
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,079
i feel like we as security professionals

280
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,560
need to do a better job of giving them

281
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,200
this information so that people can make

282
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,640
informed decisions quickly

283
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,200
we also have this chase to perfection

284
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,360
mentality uh we have it's kind of a

285
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
nasty habit right often we think about

286
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,399
things in totalitarian terms like let's

287
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,800
eliminate all of the risk let's patch

288
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,079
everything

289
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,720
don't do anything in the cloud

290
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
and the hard truth and matter is

291
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,800
businesses exist to take risk and our

292
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,000
job as information security

293
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,079
professionals is to help guide the

294
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,320
business on what risk to take

295
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,920
and what risk to maybe not take

296
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,680
even thinking you can solve a customer

297
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
problem is in fact a risk as a business

298
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,200
like the whole beginning of a business

299
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,120
is like a risk

300
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,839
so the business needs to be able to take

301
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,720
measured and informed risk to operate

302
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,240
and security teams should be no

303
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,519
different we need to help our

304
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,920
development engineering partners

305
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,480
understand and take these measured risks

306
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
as we as we're trying to get features

307
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,200
out the door attract customers grow the

308
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,240
business

309
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,160
uh deliver more features and all kinds

310
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,719
of good stuff

311
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
uh the other thing that happens here

312
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,519
uh

313
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,160
ticketing as the primary interface so

314
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,480
if you're evaluating a security tool of

315
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,399
some sort or fashion and your first

316
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,160
question is can i push all of these

317
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
issues to jira

318
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,399
you are not thinking about prioritizing

319
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,320
fixing at all you are thinking about

320
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,760
documenting

321
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,360
uh and so this is

322
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,160
the wrong way to go about thinking about

323
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,839
how to help engineering prioritize stuff

324
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,399
so if you're not getting closer to the

325
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,880
in context finding delivery of

326
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,200
information and helping people

327
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,640
understand

328
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,800
so as people are writing code as people

329
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,360
are testing code in ci cd you're getting

330
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,639
farther and farther away from that

331
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,320
context and it makes it harder and

332
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,800
harder and more expensive to be able to

333
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,880
fix those things and prioritize them

334
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,120
necessarily

335
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,560
tooling should at least give you

336
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,720
feedback in the command line or in ci cd

337
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,959
and invest in ids so that you can

338
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,600
consume this and you know whether or not

339
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,079
you consume it or how you consume it is

340
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,680
a whole different thing if you can't

341
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,200
start here

342
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,120
you have you have a really big problem

343
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,959
enabling uh engineering teams

344
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,959
now that's all if you have a security

345
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,279
team if you don't have a security team

346
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,839
you're small business uh you're still

347
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,600
growing you

348
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,279
you know you don't you haven't afforded

349
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,240
the capability of a security function

350
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
it's really hard to understand where to

351
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,480
start any of this stuff so

352
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,560
you kind of land in this realm of like

353
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,240
okay there's a hundred different things

354
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,639
i could do which one should i prioritize

355
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,000
as a cto or a vp avenge or engineering

356
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,040
manager

357
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
or even a developer

358
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,920
um so what kind of happens there is like

359
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,480
i got other stuff to do or

360
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,120
hang on maybe this devops team that i've

361
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,800
got knows something about this and can

362
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,839
help me

363
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,279
uh so those things aren't great but

364
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,839
enabling process and tooling that can

365
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,079
easily get people started quickly

366
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,680
enabled into

367
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,600
i'm testing my application security i

368
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,880
understand what i should be doing with

369
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,920
this stuff

370
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,839
and i'm making active decisions is super

371
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,639
important

372
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,000
problem number two

373
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,680
appsec tools are built for security

374
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,360
teams uh

375
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
this is really complicated and sometimes

376
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,880
hard to understand the context of what

377
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,160
you're looking at

378
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,120
because of who most of the

379
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
products are built for

380
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,360
so we're going to talk about the context

381
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,199
of why that is but

382
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,720
a ton of security tools out there look

383
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,959
like this it's i know you've seen a tool

384
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,800
that looks like this it's got all kinds

385
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,199
of options all kinds of buttons all

386
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,880
kinds of switches

387
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,399
there's a training program that comes

388
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,519
along with it when you buy a tool

389
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,600
and if you gave an engineer access to

390
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,120
this thing

391
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,040
they probably hit the x or the little

392
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,440
red circle or whatever operating system

393
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,680
you're using really quickly on this tool

394
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,560
or

395
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,639
they make fun of it for a little bit and

396
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,399
figure out how it was designed and who

397
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,720
built it and how it was designed by

398
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,920
committee and

399
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,360
why they exposed everything and then

400
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,519
they closed it so none of those things

401
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,880
is is what you want from your

402
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,639
engineering team or for your engineering

403
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,440
team you want to engage them with those

404
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,000
with tooling and information

405
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
and sometimes some of this stuff doesn't

406
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,320
work very well

407
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,000
the other thing that happens with uh

408
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,320
tools being built for security teams is

409
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,880
we play this game we have invented a lot

410
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,360
of really great new words to talk about

411
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,839
application security issues

412
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,040
and how to

413
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,880
and how to fix them a little bit uh

414
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,639
mostly we just have a lot of wall of

415
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,959
text about what an application security

416
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,160
issue is

417
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,920
and this one is my favorite because it's

418
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,160
the same thing but two different terms

419
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,279
or two different

420
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,839
initializations of the same term so

421
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,519
that's even confusing to security

422
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,519
professionals think about that from an

423
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,600
engineering perspective

424
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,120
and ultimately the real thing here is

425
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,440
using anti-csrf tokens are same site

426
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,519
policy for browsers

427
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,760
but none of these things talk about that

428
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,360
and if you were to give this information

429
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
to an engineer and they went how do i

430
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,160
fix this the answer to them is probably

431
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
oh the library or the framework that

432
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,000
you're using probably has anti-csrf

433
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,480
tokens turn them on and use them

434
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,120
which is not in any of these things so

435
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,040
that's an interesting thing that we we

436
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,959
try to do to our engineering teams is we

437
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,680
try to invent new terminology and words

438
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,360
that already describe problems that

439
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,519
they're used to dealing with input

440
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,440
sanitization cross-site scripting sql

441
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,360
injection command injection input

442
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,560
sanitization

443
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,040
output sanitization um

444
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,440
tendency filtering so broken object

445
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,839
level authorization all these things are

446
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,000
terms that exist in development land but

447
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,519
we change them

448
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,279
because they're in security land

449
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,880
now there are good appstack tools out

450
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,399
there that work in kind of this

451
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,040
developer native flow in the context of

452
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,120
how they work where they work when they

453
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,079
work

454
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,680
there's a couple different ones on here

455
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,519
that are really good that was dependency

456
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,399
check is obviously a good one um

457
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,320
pr bot depend-abot sneak fossa npm audit

458
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,639
is a good one

459
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,120
that last one is awesome um but lastly

460
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,199
and worst of all probably all of these

461
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,440
tools or most of these tools suffer from

462
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,639
problem number three that i want to talk

463
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,000
about and that is

464
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,920
the production bias

465
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,079
so the production bias is all about

466
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,079
testing in production and testing when

467
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,000
you get to production and all kinds of

468
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
good stuff and let's talk about why

469
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
first of all

470
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,839
first of all the reason why that is is

471
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,959
because of the first two things we

472
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,680
talked about security uh tools

473
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,279
application securities tools are built

474
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,720
for security teams security people

475
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,320
and production is just where they know

476
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,240
the application the best or if they're a

477
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,920
pen tester it's the only place to have

478
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,959
access to the to the application so

479
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,199
understanding that uh production

480
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,920
application and its risk in production

481
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,880
is

482
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,000
how they work most of the time uh and

483
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,480
both of these groups are very focused on

484
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,359
finding vulnerabilities and their value

485
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,599
is driven especially in pentesland their

486
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,160
value is driven out of how many things

487
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,679
did they find

488
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,199
if you hired a

489
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,959
pen test firm or had a pen test

490
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,119
engagement and they came back and said

491
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,799
we didn't find anything

492
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,480
what would your initial thought be

493
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,120
we did a great job or

494
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,799
probably not doing their job very well

495
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,480
here uh-oh

496
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,160
so that's that's an interesting thing

497
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,480
that happens with this production bias

498
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,559
uh is we're more focused on the number

499
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,960
of things found than finding and fixing

500
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,559
the right things

501
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,240
it's also very inefficient because the

502
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,559
find the people that do the finding are

503
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,200
not the fixers of this thing so there's

504
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
this whole process and loop

505
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,799
about how to get this information back

506
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,280
to people who can fix

507
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,520
it also reinforces the adversarial

508
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,400
relationship in kind of a when we find

509
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,160
stuff as that as security professionals

510
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
we go oh look at it i did my job really

511
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,760
good i found a problem

512
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,840
and it comes off to somebody else's

513
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,640
uh you broke i broke your thing or you

514
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,480
did a bad job doing the thing that you

515
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,840
do

516
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
isn't that awesome

517
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,000
um not awesome doesn't make people feel

518
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,360
great doesn't establish and uh back up

519
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,160
that team mentality

520
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,360
so what that looks like often is this so

521
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,600
i'm sure there are people out in the

522
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
audience today that have done one or two

523
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
of these things at some point i have

524
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,120
done both of these things so don't feel

525
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,200
bad if you are like looking at this

526
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,440
going wait i do this i've done both of

527
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,400
these things

528
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,559
uh and what they look like is hey before

529
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,720
you release this software i have to give

530
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,799
it the okay

531
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,600
and what that what happens there is

532
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,360
my development team goes way faster than

533
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,760
my application security person or a

534
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
couple of people

535
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
and i can't keep up and so then

536
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,880
eventually

537
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,200
uh leadership and managers in the

538
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
company go okay don't do that anymore i

539
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,880
don't know why you're doing that it's

540
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
not doing anything good for us and it's

541
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,039
delaying our release to production

542
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,960
so then we go okay cool you just push

543
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,400
that out into production and we'll come

544
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,720
back around to it at some point

545
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,280
and then we play catch-up and we're

546
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,720
playing catch-up with

547
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,160
application security problems in

548
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,600
production

549
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,640
which is

550
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,919
not awesome

551
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,160
uh it's super inefficient again we still

552
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,120
play that big loop game of i found stuff

553
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,200
i made a ticket i got it prioritized i

554
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,120
got it back to the dev the dev didn't

555
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,720
understand how to recreate the issue so

556
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,080
i had to teach them how to recreate the

557
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
issue now they've got to get the app

558
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,320
running on their local machine again so

559
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,559
that it actually runs and

560
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,320
oh okay now i fixed it and it's still

561
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,640
like six months three months six months

562
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,720
nine months years later

563
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
uh but the biggest problem with this

564
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,160
particular thing and the one thing that

565
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,120
i dislike about this methodology is the

566
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,880
bugs are in production

567
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,200
so you necessarily have to push security

568
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,840
issues into production to find them

569
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
and that's terrible because hopefully

570
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,280
you find them first

571
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
hopefully someone else with nefarious

572
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,120
activities or

573
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,200
your bug bounty program doesn't find

574
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
them before you do because either way

575
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
they cost you money uh and hopefully

576
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,600
they're not super easy to find

577
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
those are the worst kinds of things to

578
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,600
pay out bug bounty on uh and to respond

579
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,440
to security researchers and threat

580
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,039
actors and all kinds of stuff is stuff

581
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,640
you could easily find

582
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,120
before you got to production

583
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,559
this is also very frustrating for

584
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,039
software engineers because the security

585
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,200
team runs infrequent scans of code

586
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,039
that's already in production and then

587
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,640
they engage in that ticket shuffling

588
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,640
again and the engineering team has long

589
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,559
moved on to another sprint or another

590
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,159
epic or another

591
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,080
something else by the time they get this

592
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,159
information back and again we have to

593
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,240
restart this whole like what was i even

594
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,080
working on when we did that

595
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,760
how do i get this running again all

596
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,919
kinds of good stuff

597
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,039
super ineffective and inefficient now

598
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,080
there may be times when you

599
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,679
intentionally ship

600
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,480
a bug or security bug to production and

601
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,679
that isn't as a good informed decision

602
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,960
with product and engineering and

603
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,720
security being able to go

604
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
hey i know that there's a security

605
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,159
problem here the risk is low the

606
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,760
likelihood is low

607
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,360
we should ship this anyway and we'll

608
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,000
quickly come back and fix it as a fast

609
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
follow

610
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,960
that's an awesome informed decision to

611
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
make that is much much different than

612
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,440
i'm pretty sure it's good let's ship it

613
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,400
or

614
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,320
don't ship it till i check it out and

615
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,000
i've got a lot of other things to do so

616
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,520
i'm going to be pretty busy for the next

617
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,360
week so i'm going to hold up your

618
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,120
deployment for a week

619
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,880
that doesn't help you meet customer

620
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,120
demands or customer commitments

621
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,280
and turns into this blocker process

622
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,600
again

623
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,080
let's talk a little bit of how to get

624
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,400
started kind of the right way or

625
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,240
what i think is the right way

626
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,799
and the very first thing about this is i

627
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,760
think

628
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,960
uh

629
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,000
security tests and security testing

630
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,760
should work the exact same way other

631
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,880
software testing does and that is

632
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,559
uh you know when a unit test breaks you

633
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,480
know that the code's not working because

634
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,080
the unit test doesn't work and the

635
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,360
integration test doesn't work and

636
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,520
something's broken because the compiler

637
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,679
can't make a binary out of

638
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,360
uh out of the code that you wrote

639
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,320
there's lots of ways to do testing

640
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,000
uh whether it's unit tests functional

641
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,120
tests integration tests compiler tests

642
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,720
security testing should be just like

643
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,880
that should just act like that you

644
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,120
should be able to recreate these tests

645
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,280
locally so that when you

646
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,120
get code into

647
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,440
a ci cd system and you're doing security

648
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,520
testing there as well it's not a black

649
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,679
box you could recreate this locally if

650
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,840
you wanted to to be able to test and do

651
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,120
it locally

652
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,799
just like unit testing and integration

653
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,880
tests it shouldn't be a black box thing

654
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,200
that exists in in development that

655
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,720
doesn't give you feedback doesn't tell

656
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,640
you what's happening you can't reproduce

657
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,080
it

658
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,000
but it breaks your build that's never a

659
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,360
good thing

660
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,679
um and so when a

661
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,440
team introduces a vulnerability they

662
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,120
should know because it fails a security

663
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,200
test in some form or fashion and what

664
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,919
that looks like on our devops mobius is

665
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,760
over this is where the shift left term

666
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,679
comes from right on the left side of our

667
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,520
mobius here during

668
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,159
coding and building and testing is where

669
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,640
security testing should

670
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,440
primarily live like you can test in that

671
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,360
deploy and operate space

672
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,200
but that should not be the first place

673
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,280
you test the first place you test should

674
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,960
be back there in that code build and

675
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,080
test part of this loop

676
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,760
instrumenting those tests in ci cd

677
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,919
giving immediate feedback and the

678
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,840
ability to for an engineer to stay in

679
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,600
context of what they're building when

680
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,120
they're building it how they're building

681
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,919
it

682
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,200
and differentials so if i make a new

683
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,440
code commit and a new issue shows up

684
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,279
it's probably in that code that i just

685
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,120
wrote or could just committed so i don't

686
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,559
have to go looking all over the app

687
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,400
necessarily i can look in what i just

688
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,720
added

689
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,400
lots of uh our customers check for

690
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,679
security bugs on every pr or mr or

691
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,279
whatever merging strategy you

692
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,520
particularly have and that gives the

693
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,400
test information directly back to those

694
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,840
engineers as they're working on it

695
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,679
engineers are smart people that are

696
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,279
writing software for businesses and

697
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,039
companies to create value are really

698
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,039
smart let them be smart

699
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,880
security teams tend to want to approve

700
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,159
everything

701
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,440
and what that means is other people

702
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,760
can't make decisions you've taken them

703
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,919
out of the whole entire decision loop if

704
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,159
you are approving their decisions

705
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,440
they're not making decisions they're

706
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,279
making suggestions and you're approving

707
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,559
it

708
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,640
allow this kind of technology to spark

709
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,240
collaboration between development and

710
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,320
security but enable devs to do their

711
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,400
work enable them to do

712
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,840
self-serve figure out and fix problems

713
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,279
and if they make the wrong decision

714
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,120
that's okay too

715
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,400
but they've made a decision and

716
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,240
documented it so that is really really

717
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,039
good

718
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,640
now you can have a conversation as an

719
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,720
abstract professional about it with a

720
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,480
development team about decisions that

721
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,440
they made

722
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,960
and why you think they might be wrong

723
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,880
and why they think they might be right

724
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,799
that's a good discussion to have and a

725
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,559
good partnership

726
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,039
business risk is all collaboration and

727
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,520
no one team knows the answer to any of

728
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,320
these

729
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,799
questions or outcomes

730
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,640
if you're doing this remember you might

731
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,400
end up in a therapy session it might get

732
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,080
a little rough for a little bit

733
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,039
um but it's doable it is totally doable

734
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,520
to partner with the engineering team and

735
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,440
change their perception

736
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,840
about the information security team as a

737
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,240
partner and someone who enables them as

738
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,640
as opposed to a blocker and or security

739
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,240
ninjas who are like

740
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,080
you guys made a mistake i dropped out of

741
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,159
the ceiling don't do that

742
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,679
uh

743
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,279
lastly the most important part here is

744
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,559
just start like if you've got an

745
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,919
application security program and it's

746
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,720
not making good headway restart

747
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,840
if you don't have an application

748
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,039
security program and you're trying to

749
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,840
start one start start with a small team

750
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,919
a small engineering team help become

751
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,799
their partner help give them information

752
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,039
choose an application and their ci cd

753
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,039
pipeline get them the information they

754
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,159
need

755
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,159
choose a technology i personally like

756
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,640
sca and dast because those two things

757
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,960
are actionable in two different ways

758
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,159
and they both give you really good

759
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,279
information

760
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,760
once that's working iterate and expand

761
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,960
out to the other rest of the

762
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,799
organization they'll probably be your

763
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,960
champion as engineering teams if you do

764
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,000
it well

765
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,919
they'll talk to their other development

766
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,840
partners and friends and say hey

767
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,360
actually the information security team

768
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,039
is helping us application security team

769
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,720
is helping us and we're going faster and

770
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,320
we're producing better code you should

771
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,240
talk to those guys

772
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,480
or girls sorry no i don't mean to be

773
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,240
exclusive i mean you know

774
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,440
general guys

775
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,919
uh lastly that was that's it for my time

776
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,200
everybody thank you so much for

777
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,960
listening to me hopefully you're

778
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,120
enjoying your late friday afternoon i

779
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,840
know i am it's happy hour time time to

780
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,400
get down uh if you're already past happy

781
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,840
hour then you know drive safe
