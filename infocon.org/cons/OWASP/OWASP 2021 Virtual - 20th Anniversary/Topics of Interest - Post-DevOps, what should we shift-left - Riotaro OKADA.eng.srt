first of all let me congratulate

50
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,200
everyone on the wasp 20th anniversary my

51
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,599
first involvement with the wasp

52
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,200
community was 2003.

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,640
i read the original wasp guide document

54
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
and i started exchanging information

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
locally

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,920
and with several web security

57
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,680
communities in the u.s like wasc

58
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,720
and

59
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,560
yes wasp

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,360
at that time in japan we just started

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560
the wasp forum web application security

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,840
forum with friends i remember that

63
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,319
for the kickoff event mr gerry mayer

64
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,360
grossman came to have a keynote speech

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,560
in tokyo

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,760
this organization is still available and

67
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,200
it hosts the hardening project which i

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,280
will introduce in this talk

69
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,599
the early japanese translation of

70
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,239
various wasp documents was seen in

71
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,040
sourceforge.net

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,720
and today

73
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,239
one of these was guided version 1.1 and

74
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,640
was top 10 list with

75
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,159
mr takashi from top operating to please

76
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,440
check it

77
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,319
it's really interesting

78
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,920
and

79
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,120
in

80
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,120
20 2011 we restarted the worst local

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
chapter in japan with

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
as you know

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,560
sen ueno

84
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,120
and some really powerful community

85
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
leaders

86
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,599
check this

87
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,360
now there are

88
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,560
more than

89
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,439
10 000 users in the japanese wasp

90
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,720
community

91
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,920
actually

92
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,640
i've heard from the x

93
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,830
and

94
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,439

the executive director of the wasp

96
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,639
foundation the most frequent visitors to

97
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,279
wasp.org from japan

98
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,680
i'm pleased that so many people want to

99
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,320
study about application security despite

100
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,040
the

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,440
challenge of not being native english

102
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,520
speakers

103
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,000
thank you to everyone in the wasp

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,960
community and wasp japan community for

105
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,520
all your contributions and support

106
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,479
we have amount of memories

107
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,320
and about there was japan history

108
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,560
yeah

109
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,440
we could listen to all various talks

110
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,840
about shift left in this conference

111
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,880
right

112
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,720
so what is shift left for you guys

113
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,280
we all knew know the

114
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,840
the importance of integrating security

115
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,680
early on in the development process yes

116
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,320
as you know development shouldn't rely

117
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,240
on the last one mile testing

118
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,199
and it doesn't fit the devops cycle at

119
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,240
all

120
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,440
transform the death march to defeat the

121
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,160
vulnerabilities before release timing

122
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,680
into the continuous work for the secure

123
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,199
design and code

124
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,080
this looked like the fundamental first

125
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,800
goal in shift left but

126
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,440
at the same time we've all experienced

127
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,960
the problems and frustrations trying to

128
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,360
achieve this why

129
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,039
it is only one aspect is it a dev

130
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,520
centric approach or a sec

131
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,039
centric approach in reality have you

132
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,919
ever seen the development team and the

133
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,080
security teams working well together

134
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,720
the truth is

135
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,400
it's the opposite of that

136
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,520
they generally don't work well together

137
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,160
this situation is where we need to start

138
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,840
the shift draft process

139
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,680
developers spend most of their effort

140
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,720
fulfilling new feature requests and

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
fixing bugs

142
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,240
security can often be our burden for the

143
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,960
already busy development teams

144
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
and the security guys bars in with their

145
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
testing and reviews

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
here maybe how the conversation usually

147
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,440
goes

148
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,039
we've got all these vulnerabilities

149
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,840
and this is a risky implementation

150
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,080
do you mean developers aren't to work

151
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,639
hard enough sick sick

152
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,240
team

153
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,319
no no but they're

154
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,599
not applying the guidance we gave them

155
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,160
in the pipeline and this system lacks

156
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,400
security

157
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,440
we may need security tools

158
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
with the time pressure of the release

159
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,880
schedule

160
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,560
these delays

161
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,520
must be very stressful for

162
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,880
everyone

163
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,919
now we need to change ourselves to have

164
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,000
a higher perspective

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,639
the relationship between deb

166
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,560
and sex should not remain bad

167
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,400
how can we improve this problem

168
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,039
let's think about what we can do

169
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,360
the most famous wasp document is

170
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,479
yes

171
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,800
wasp top 10. this shows the top the top

172
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,680
10 most critical risks it's not just a

173
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,960
top vulnerabilities wrist

174
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,440
it's updated every three or four years

175
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,160
and the latest draft was published this

176
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
week

177
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,440
and it hasn't been finalized

178
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,639
yet but

179
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,479
almost finalized but has attracted

180
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,879
a lot of attention in japan the latest

181
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,479
version has

182
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,120
good content and reflects current

183
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
development issues well

184
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,280
however

185
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,680
we need to be both kind and careful

186
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,599
when sharing this document with

187
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,160
developers

188
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,639
there's a big mind gap between

189
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,440
developers and security guys

190
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
finding a new failure from the top 10

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,120
list can be an unfortunate event

192
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,080
from the developer's point of view

193
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,440
sometimes ignorance is bliss

194
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,720
here's a different top 10 list

195
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,120
do you want are you interested in that

196
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,480
the top 10 reasons developers

197
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,160
dislike security top 10.

198
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,040
at the last race conference mr chris

199
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,600
romeo introduced this list please take a

200
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,480
look

201
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,839
what do you

202
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,600
think developers think

203
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,720
security tools are loud and inaccurate

204
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,279
and that security guys never celebrate

205
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,680
our successes

206
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,200
security changes its mind all the time

207
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,839
and security process

208
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,200
processes are complicated difficult and

209
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,399
undefined they don't know why people put

210
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,200
so much effort and time into security

211
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,600
and this is a big one

212
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,640
no one ever tells developers how to do

213
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,360
security

214
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,959
which part of the story resonates

215
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,320
with you the most

216
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,560
remember this is the developer is

217
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,040
talking to security people either way we

218
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,560
need to focus on the common goal

219
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,600
if the

220
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,160
the old approach doesn't work

221
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,320
we need to change it

222
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,640
suppose you want to collaborate

223
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,120
effectively in with the dev team

224
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,279
in that case it is essential to

225
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,160
understand their primary languages

226
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,920
typical development environments and

227
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
frameworks they use

228
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,480
yes it is possible to point out security

229
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,160
vulnerabilities

230
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,240
without learning how to code

231
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,959
to the detail

232
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,000
but how can you communicate with other

233
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
stakeholders

234
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,160
if you don't understand the whole

235
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,760
components languages

236
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,120
way of thinking

237
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,399
this gap is mutual understanding

238
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,720
can lead to serious failures

239
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,000
there must be cases

240
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,480
where the team uses components and

241
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,160
platforms on

242
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,440
aws

243
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,399
azure

244
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,120
and gcp set up with minimal

245
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,839
configuration we shouldn't be pointing

246
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,720
out

247
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,519
how they miss the specific details in

248
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,480
the http headers

249
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,839
for example

250
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,160
still instead we should deal with the

251
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,600
effective configuration on the platform

252
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,519
first

253
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,399
note

254
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,519
uh

255
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,560
was top 10

256
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,440
2021

257
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,800
0 5 security misconfiguration category

258
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,600
pointed out 90

259
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,240
of applications were tested for some

260
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,959
form of misconfiguration

261
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,560
at the very least

262
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,120
we should be able to do reviews using

263
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,240
their development environment

264
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,120
stop overwhelming the team with black

265
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,639
box test result stop introducing tools

266
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,600
without mutual understanding

267
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,440
if we do not stop doing so it leads to

268
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,160
happy results and failures

269
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,720
additionally i i'd like to encourage

270
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,160
everyone to be aware of

271
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,880
a04

272
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,600
insecure design and

273
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
a09

274
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,079
and security logging and monitoring

275
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
failures

276
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,079
categories have you ever took a look

277
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,440
take a look

278
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,399
uh because uh with analyzing the current

279
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,440
ops functions and its quality

280
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,519
and it is getting easier to get

281
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,720
consensus how design should care ops

282
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,600
more

283
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,320
this information should be mandatory for

284
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,680
their risk profiling

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,360
so

286
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,600
this is the important tips

287
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
to make the planning

288
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,440
and the designing

289
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,320
steps clear

290
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,160
yep

291
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,959
so

292
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,839
to properly shift left we need to focus

293
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,959
on this three point

294
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,639
we need to focus on

295
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,519
one

296
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,320
maximizing mutual understanding and

297
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,440
cooperation to know how business score

298
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,560
and risks relate to defenses in order to

299
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,120
decide on the right defenses

300
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,760
three keep up to date with the latest

301
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,399
security knowledge and keep our

302
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,040
perspective fresh

303
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,760
so let me introduce the next

304
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,839
and the main contents

305
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,240
uh today

306
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,800
in japan

307
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,360
we have a security competition project

308
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,000
we've been holding for

309
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,800
almost decade called the hardening

310
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,680
project it is an eight-hour security

311
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,360
competition

312
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,680
wasp japan collaborates with this

313
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,120
project and our members are heavily

314
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,399
involved in both their technical and

315
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,720
operational aspects of their event

316
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,760
and i imagine you are learning a virtual

317
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,880
e-commerce

318
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
shopping site

319
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,399
and on the crowd and are responsible for

320
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,920
its management system and desktops

321
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
your team

322
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,959
wants to update all of this and keep

323
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,360
the e-commerce business online

324
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,560
continuously and support its growth

325
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,160
to own money

326
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,000
and and what but

327
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,880
what happens if the servers and the

328
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,360
endpoints and have

329
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,560
potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses

330
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,600
and what happens if attackers use every

331
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,160
means possible to exploit these weak

332
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,040
points

333
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,360
through cyber attacks

334
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
what role do you need

335
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,000
every role will be needed

336
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,440
and of course you don't want to hurt or

337
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,160
bother their customers with security

338
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,680
incidents or miss operations so the team

339
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,279
has to

340
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,760
harden the system and keep it available

341
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,160
to users

342
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,040
the hardening project gives participants

343
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,760
this challenging experience for eight

344
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,199
hours

345
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,600
the team with the highest sales amount

346
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,360
uh and the score at the end wins

347
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,720
uh in the wiz wins their com competition

348
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,079
participants come from all over japan

349
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,079
from service companies

350
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,680
uh government

351
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,000
agencies the defense force and cyber

352
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,040
police

353
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,519
and both engineers and students as well

354
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,959
as people involved in i.t systems for

355
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,759
their daily job

356
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,920
and we divide the

357
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,600
100 or more participants for each event

358
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,560
into

359
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,800
10 through 12

360
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,880
teams here are some pictures from the

361
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,600
past events

362
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,240
once the competition starts

363
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,600
the teams log into their environments

364
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,279
and analyze the settings so many servers

365
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,000
and how many endpoints are there or

366
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
something like that

367
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,279
and the online store faces a series of

368
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,320
cyber attacks

369
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,040
yeah that's my god

370
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,399
so they

371
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,680
they will try to austral personal

372
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,720
information taking down servers

373
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,720
and web pages and so on teams deal with

374
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
attacks

375
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,079
and can improve their web applications

376
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,199
lively

377
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,839
or use vendor services

378
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,799
to strengthen their defenses

379
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,039
yes here is marketplace they can

380
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,720
purchase a procure some

381
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,799
additional defense items

382
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,280
in addition to recovering from technical

383
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
failures teams hunters

384
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,080
teams should handle

385
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,080
customer care and support

386
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,360
each team's sales amount is displayed in

387
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,720
real time on the competition scoreboard

388
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,960
actually this is developed by sen

389
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,160
leaders in wasp japan

390
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,360
really cool

391
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,880
it is changing

392
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,520
for each competition

393
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,919
yeah real scenarios

394
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,799
from recent incidents are included in

395
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,000
their competition this is the secret

396
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,240
the goal is to contribute to everyone

397
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,600
involved including breakers defenders

398
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,120
and builders

399
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,160
they can update their knowledge about

400
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,320
the incident response

401
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
in addition to dealing with customer

402
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,039
complaints like no privacy policy being

403
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,600
posted a team sometimes have press

404
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,480
conferences when major incidents happen

405
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,160
their public radiations response is also

406
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,960
evaluated

407
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,559
yep

408
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,760
after the hardening day a competition we

409
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,120
have a presentation a session to review

410
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,840
results on a different day

411
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,799
we call this the softening day

412
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,679
this is the second secret

413
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,919
all teams and attackers

414
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,320
give presentations to share and

415
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,720
summarize their activities

416
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,200
what strategies were successful

417
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,240
which techniques were effective uh and

418
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,600
which were not

419
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,720
the presentations are available on

420
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,200
youtube life we have hours

421
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,799
and the party at the end

422
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,559
yeah here are some comments we received

423
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,720
from participants

424
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,280
i run and maintain an e-commerce site at

425
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,200
work

426
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,120
but

427
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,080
taking part in the hunting

428
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,160
project was my first experience dealing

429
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,960
with real-time security defense it was a

430
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,240
scary and a spine chilling experience it

431
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,160
was great to see first-hand

432
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,280
collaboration between different roles in

433
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,720
the team in the same team

434
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,960
another guide

435
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,760
and

436
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,919
in the real world you don't know you

437
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,799
don't experience a day where so many

438
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,919
problems

439
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,320
like hardening project keep occurring

440
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,960
one after another it was a tough

441
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,840
challenge to maintain and brush up sense

442
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,039
of urgency and respond calmly

443
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,799
that's great

444
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,520
and it's fantastic to see the battle

445
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,520
between skilled attackers and defenders

446
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,720
yeah

447
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,720
so

448
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,280
the first event was in tokyo and then in

449
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,880
okinawa kansai hokkaido and kyushu over

450
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,799
the past decade

451
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,280
so we could collaborate with

452
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,919
each local engineers and waspers right

453
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,799
and during the the pandemic we heard it

454
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,480
online

455
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,120
this is always a wonderful opportunity

456
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,640
to update our security knowledge and way

457
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,840
of thinking

458
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,679
applications

459
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,280
for this year event have started

460
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,400
yeah

461
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,760
and the online event will be in november

462
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,200
welcoming

463
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,480
global participants in the future is

464
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,080
being planned if you can use japanese

465
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,400
please come in that's all

466
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,440
role

467
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
all kinds of roles

468
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,480
are welcome this event stay tuned

469
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,400
hi

470
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,559
did you find some message or lessons

471
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,760
from hardening project or wasp japan

472
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,120
activities

473
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,760
so how can we enhance

474
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,039
upset over the next decade

475
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,480
so

476
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,080
is eliminating vulnerabilities

477
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,559
only doing this

478
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,799
enough to create a free and wonderful

479
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,840
internet society

480
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,120
security engineers who only talk about

481
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
fixing vulnerabilities or finding

482
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,559
vulnerabilities

483
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,520
should be kicked out of the

484
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,000
dev ops loop nowadays

485
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,840
so let's shift left

486
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,760
of course finding vulnerability is very

487
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,159
important and fixing boundaries is

488
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,640
really important as well

489
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,440
but

490
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,240
if we make a new security enhancement

491
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,960
guide proactive controls for the next

492
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,200
decade

493
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,440
the list should include concepts like

494
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,960
security should not be a silo we need to

495
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,760
act more like guardrails

496
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,720
not gatekeepers

497
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,679
discussing the most effective

498
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,080
fixing points and timing

499
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,840
with developers or stakeholders

500
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,720
it is key

501
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,799
to work as a team

502
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,760
we should know the language

503
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,120
they use and environments

504
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,679
they placed as well as

505
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,320
how to write code and use tool

506
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,400
security guys tools and knowledge

507
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,840
need to be updated

508
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,760
frequently unfortunately

509
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,200
we know

510
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,679
there are a number of outdated wasp

511
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,039
documents

512
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,760
if it is needed let us update that

513
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,400
security guys must explain how to

514
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,159
remediate risks

515
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,480
even if even if it is a plan b

516
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,200
so let's discuss about

517
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,120
how to find

518
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,000
the

519
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,840
problem or issues by themselves

520
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,320
so the common goal is

521
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,440
to achieve security and praise

522
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,120
our common

523
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,360
success

524
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,960
there's various progressive

525
