2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,440
i don't have a presentation i want to

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,759
walk you through the project today so

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,720
also

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,559
we've had a couple you may not believe

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,480
this no now audience is a little bit of

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,599
shock but some of our owa

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,440
have gone over their time a little long

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,439
on the tooth myself as well so i'm going

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,760
to do a shorter version of this because

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,519
this is really a this is a documentation

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,519
project it's a little more open this is

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,240
the oh wash cheat sheet series again

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,240
this started with eric sheridan and jeff

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,159
williams who wrote this cross site

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,239
request forgery cheat sheet and the

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,399
original xss prevention cheat sheet one

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,719
of the most heavily hit pages in owass

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,920
history and uh and when i was a owass

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,239
volunteer over like 15 years ago i'm

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,680
like this is some great material we

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,840
should do more of this so i began to

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,480
expand that series with the help of many

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,480
other people and so

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,199
this recent version of it about about

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,800
two years ago i stepped away from the

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,000
project and brought in some other

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,600
leaders and they rewrote the

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,520
infrastructure of the project moving it

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,640
from the old oas wiki to its own website

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,799
and github and automation

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,799
alar lang is a big part of that he's

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,560
left the project he helps a little bit

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
and but alar lang helped rebuild our

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,640
infrastructure at the cheat sheet series

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
jacob markowski

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,759
is

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,280
he's like he's like the cheat seat

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,799
series buddha

40
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,880
all i'm saying is like there this is

41
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,360
such an active product there are so many

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,040
people involved hundreds of people

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
involved leadership has changed a few

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,280
times it's a little chaotic at times and

45
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
jacob is like the buddha who sits there

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,600
and gets work done and helps promote the

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,720
project so jacob is the co-lead of this

48
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,119
project right now and i i'm sorry he

49
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,880
can't be here right now i wish he was

50
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,799
here but jacob's very like calm

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,680
and peaceful and constantly supportive

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,000
work is instrumental to keeping the

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,399
project rolling i also who should be on

54
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,880
this list is ilar lang he rewrote our

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,920
infrastructure to automate the editing

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,079
and the creation of the site via

57
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,240
scripting and alar you did a great job

58
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,399
maturing the cheat sheet series

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,800
when when i came back to the series

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,959
i made some really big and bold changes

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,400
that upset some of the previous

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,040
volunteers i regret that i felt it was

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,200
necessary intellectually there's always

64
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
better ways to go about the process so

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,720
it's like the leader like you know i

66
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,080
learned how to be a better leader along

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,239
the way and i just want to say thank you

68
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,080
to all the previous volunteers who got

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,400
us this far so let's let's look at some

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,840
of this right so here's the wash cheat

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,480
sheet series what this is basically like

72
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,080
a another wiki inside of our wiki where

73
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,319
we're maintaining each and every one of

74
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,680
these pages

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,879
with strong editorial leadership and

76
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,959
individual maintenance of each of these

77
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,120
cheat sheets by a little sub team some

78
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,640
of the more active ones are like the

79
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,800
authentication cheat sheet and you can

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,519
see how big how big this is right

81
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,319
this is a this is a supplementary to

82
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,720
to the asvs requirements with more

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,920
detail

84
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,400
so someone who works on for example we

85
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,319
talked about the asvs standard a while

86
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,800
back and we want to combine a companion

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,959
companion guide to explain the details

88
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,360
and my vision is we have an asvs

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,840
requirement that's one or two sentences

90
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,920
and a cheat sheet series page that

91
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
expands that requirement into into

92
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,680
details or you can point to other wiki

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
pages that are being maintained in the

94
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,680
community section of the oas wiki as

95
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,560
well

96
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,159
and so let's look at let's look a little

97
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,519
bit behind scenes here everything we're

98
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,760
doing at the cheat sheet series is in

99
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,680
github this if you want to volunteer um

100
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,519
this is where you want to be you want to

101
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,720
be in

102
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,319
fact let me walk through this you want

103
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,080
to be in the

104
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,959
github of the cheat sheet series go to

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,280
the cheat sheet page and there they all

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,440
are and you can see we've had edits in

107
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,000
the last month we've had edits seven

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,599
minutes ago that's about that's what i'm

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,200
doing i'm sitting here like

110
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,640
getting my backlog cleaned up so

111
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
and each of these cheat sheets is

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,840
managed independently when when i i i

113
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,760
sometimes commit to master and get

114
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,519
yelled at and that's okay we have enough

115
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,760
people eyeballing this where

116
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,000
where changes are reviewed by the

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,920
community even when i least expect them

118
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,879
to and so what i'm doing right now is

119
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,440
with with jacob is uh uh and there we go

120
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,720
there's one of our other cheat sheets

121
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,440
yeah

122
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,680
we like we first wrote for example the

123
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,400
access control cheat sheet and i'm i'm

124
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,280
in the process of of redirecting that to

125
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,520
the authorization cheat sheet a recent

126
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
contribution that rewrote that whole

127
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,080
page so i'm migrating that one over what

128
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,240
else do we and here here i am fixing my

129
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,199
my bad wiki markup all right there we go

130
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,199
so if you look at these individual cheat

131
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,240
sheets you know this project has gone

132
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
through an ebb and flow the ebb is we

133
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,800
keep adding detail to the cheat sheets

134
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,720
and then i remind folks that's a cheat

135
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
sheet and i try to remove information

136
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,040
that's extraneous our goal here is not

137
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,160
to be a full comprehensive discussion on

138
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
each topic it's really meant to be a

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,440
cheat where if you're new at say cross

140
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,919
site request forgery the cross

141
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,440
cross every quote not cross-site

142
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,400
scripting cross-site request forgery

143
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,280
prevention cheat sheet and uh

144
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,360
like reading this once should should in

145
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,960
a concise way

146
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
give you a complete discourse on this

147
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,080
topic so all i ask dive into chi chi

148
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,039
series read the guide pass the word to

149
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,720
other developers there's hundreds of

150
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
cheat sheets on secure coding which is

151
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,960
the main topic of its defense there's a

152
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,199
few attack cheat sheets but 95 plus

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,360
percent these are cheat sheets on how to

154
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,520
prevent certain problems

155
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,880
and my goal is for you to hand this one

156
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,120
page guide to a developer and they have

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
a good idea of what the vulnerability is

158
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,639
and really how to stop it in a complete

159
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,520
way i'm gonna end earl early right if

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,280

way we can there's strong process but

168
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,600
you can just send me an email and i'll

169
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,880
take care of it for you if you don't

170
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,120
want to do it yourself any way that you

171
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,600
can contribute to enhance these cheat

172
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,840
sheets i think it's going to help the

173
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,759
foundation and the appsec community in

174
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,759
some way hey i want to drill down into

175
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,520
one thing though i just made this change

176
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,639
recently

177
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,720
and and just to show you how we're

178
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,639
trying to describe some of the

179
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,160
complexity i'm going to show you two

180
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,919
cheat sheets here's the summary for

181
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,919
request forgery number one if your

182
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,639
framework has built-in csr protection

183
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,960
use that that's usually your best step

184
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,120
number two if you have stateful web

185
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,199
session software you synchronize your

186
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,759
token if you have stateless api software

187
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,000
that uses a web front end that's where

188
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,120
that's where the double submit cookie

189
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,599
pattern shines and i recommend that you

190
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,599
use same site you're probably using it

191
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,280
whether you like it or not it's default

192
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,199
in chromium now in chrome and many other

193
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,360
browsers so if you don't set the same

194
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,479
site cookie it's going to be labeled as

195
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,479
uh it's going to be lacks and if you

196
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,000
want to remove it you've got to double

197
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
set a cookie you've got to set a cookie

198
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,599
with same site none and set a cookie

199
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,599
with no same site attribute the same

200
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,680
double setting or it's not going to work

201
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,280
in all browsers that's google

202
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,599
suggestions on the same site cookie

203
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,199
attribute when you want to support older

204
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,919
browsers also re-authentication helps

205
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,560
any feature the use of like origin based

206
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,120
or a referrer based header verification

207
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,599
we accept that i'm not recommending that

208
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,280
so much anymore and i'll remove it

209
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
eventually but you can look it up you

210
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,720
can't look at the

211
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,479
origin or refer headers to make sure it

212
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,919
came from the right origin and that can

213
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,160
be spoofed by the way of course remember

214
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,560
cross-site scripting it can be used to

215
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,400
defeat all c-series so you got to be

216
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,280
bulletproof from xss fixing c-surf is

217
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,400
pretty easy fixing xss is brutally hard

218
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,360
to get right and also don't use get for

219
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
state-changing operations let me go over

220
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,039
one more cheat sheet

221
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,479
um as well i'm gonna go look at the

222
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,120
the password storage cheat sheet and

223
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,000
this is there's a little bit of

224
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,199
controversy here i kind of i manage this

225
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,039
one i kind of put even though several

226
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,520
folks were complaining about my changes

227
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,280
i pushed this one through it's part of

228
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
my job as an editor not to do it in a

229
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,199
mean way but i

230
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
went and worked with the hashcat team

231
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,120
talked to scoob one of the main

232
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,639
mathematicians

233
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,879
and got his advice on how to tune

234
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,280
password storage algorithms

235
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,919
and he disagreed with the ietf who has

236
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,919
their own recommendations in the ietf

237
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,000
password storage recommendation guide

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
and he showed me his math and few people

239
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,039
backed him up so based on the hashcat

240
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,679
team's work who's hashcat the main open

241
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,680
source password cracking software of the

242
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,360
planet the best of the breeder part of

243
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,160
that team jerry gosney and a few others

244
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,399
helped make this happen let's look at

245
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,399
this this is my advice and the cheat

246
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,000
sheet series advice on how to store a

247
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,720
password number one

248
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,360
argon 2id is what you should be using

249
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
with a minimum of 15 megs of memory

250
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,640
iteration counted to one degree of

251
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,279
parallelism minimal argon 2i is not

252
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,200
available go ahead and use bcrip with a

253
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,440
work factor of 10 or more but it's got a

254
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,160
72 byte limit and you're gonna pre-hash

255
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,200
bad idea you got a blo you gonna count

256
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,680
72 bytes in your password that's hard to

257
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,120
do you don't know how many bytes a

258
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
character is per se in every language

259
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,959
easily so i say stop using bcrypt it's a

260
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,680
junk algorithm i'm sorry it is folks

261
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,080
stop it stop this bcrip's madness that

262
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,120
everyone needs to do instead use argon

263
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,800
2id yeah okay and if you if bcrip's not

264
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,880
available or you're using s crypt for

265
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,920
legacy

266
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,560
minimum cpu 2 to the 16 minimum block

267
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,519
size of 10 20 10 24 bytes and parallel

268
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,440
is a parameter of

269
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,720
you're if you've got a federal

270
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,440
government us government sorry europeans

271
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,760
u.s federal government compliance fips

272
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,920
140 use pbk f2 with 310 000 iterations

273
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,200
or an hmac of 256 if you're going to use

274
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,800
a different internal hasher there's your

275
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,279
minimum iteration count it's math

276
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,800
so i really think that the password

277
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,600
storage cheat sheet has migrated to the

278
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,160
point where we're giving really specific

279
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,560
recommendations to help developers write

280
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,279
secure code that's why the cheat sheet

281
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,440
series exists if you have a question for

282
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,040
me i'm easy to find i'm jim at

283
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,600
owasp.org

284
