1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,030
[Music]

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,160
yeah i hope you're seeing my splats now

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,960
okay yeah i can see slice so go ahead

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,080
great

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,199
so hi everyone uh nicos is the sort of

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,720
version of my name

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,320
um

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,840
a little bit about what we will see

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880
today uh we're gonna take a look at

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,880
digital scheming attacks or east killing

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,760
attacks as they are also

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,960
cold

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,840
and uh we're gonna take a look at the

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,000
method of detection like how to detect

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
ongoing history skinning attacks in

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,840
order to

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,600
uh to stop them

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,320
and this detection method is intended to

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,800
be used by application specialist or iot

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,360
security specialist or the

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,760
host programmers who are to have uh

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,399
who are into security

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,680
and we will take a look at the

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,760
characteristics of these other parts and

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,640
then uh look uh take a closer look at

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,280
how to how the detection method works

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
and

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,520
uh

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,640
if you have time we'll also

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,880
get a look at a demo

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,000
short demo

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
so let's get started

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,119
uh

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,080
some extra things uh maybe about

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,960
me i have some background as we said in

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,040
development research i

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
worked in telecom finance and i do

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,400
application security since 2017

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,799
which means threat modeling web

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,799
application security testing education

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,360
and so on and

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,119
we are

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,320
myself and a few other people leading

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,040
the local chapter in stockholm so

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,840
you're very pleased uh welcome to

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
contact us if you would like to present

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,439
your own work

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,479
and we will be happy to arrange that

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,119
but to the point of uh this talk uh

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,040
let's start by talking about scheming

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,479
attacks and we will start from the

52
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,719
physical world because that's where they

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,000
initially

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,159
uh appeared

55
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,318
these kind of attacks usually happen at

56
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,959
remote location where you have

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,120
payment machines atm machines gas

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,480
stations

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
places where they will

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,680
accept your credit card and what the

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,680
criminal will do is that they will

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,879
usually

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,000
have

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
a digital

65
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,360
device that they will place on top of

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,000
the actual receiver of the credit card

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,879
and this is called like the schemer

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,239
and what they will do is that they will

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,720
target the magnetic type of your credit

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
card they will copy the data and store

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640
it locally on the

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,519
skimming device that's like the standard

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,680
type of attack

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,120
of course they go after your credit card

75
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,480
information and

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,519
they pick remote locations because at

77
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,519
the later stage the criminal will have

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,120
to pass by

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,640
collect the digital equipment that looks

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,120
a lot like the actual thing the actual

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,480
receiver of the

82
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,560
tablet that's what you will not be able

83
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,720
to to detect it as seen in the in the

84
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,000
image

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,800
and they will collect the loot the

86
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,480
collected credit cards and then

87
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,360
just

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,879
sell them further on probably to the

89
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,040
dark web or other places

90
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,560
one characteristic of this attack is

91
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,000
that functionality is not broken you

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,519
will still get your money you will still

93
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,200
make your payment but you will not

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,440
really realize you're being attacked

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,159
unless uh or until

96
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,159
uh your critical information is actually

97
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,400
used by another

98
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,840
person at a later stage

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
let's make the jump at the digital world

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
now what are digital scheming attacks

101
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,920
there is a term that is used broadly

102
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,239
when whenever someone is talking about

103
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,319
digital scheming attacks on that

104
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,239
umbrella term it's

105
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,040
uh mainscart so made start is a term

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
used for

107
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,400
several groups doing the same thing and

108
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
that is stealing credit information from

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,519
from web

110
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,280
websites

111
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
and from victims who are inserting their

112
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,599
credit cards into these websites in

113
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,680
order to pay

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,480
whatever the service they they are

115
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,119
they are buying

116
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,959
they are quite notorious and that's

117
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,560
probably why they made it to wireless

118
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,279
most notorious people online of 2018

119
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,959
together with some other

120
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,680
really interesting personalities

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,720
uh

122
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,960
europol has also

123
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,080
uh an assessment of 2020 where they have

124
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,000
a whole section about them

125
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,040
and there this

126
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,400
group is actually

127
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,520
referred to as a group doing

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,759
attacks using javascript

129
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,639
and their goal is to inject a schema

130
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,919
code or a piece of javascript onto

131
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,280
payments

132
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,440
web pages and then steal the credit card

133
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,600
they use a drop server so that's like

134
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
the server where they collect

135
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,919
uh the stolen credit cards and then they

136
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,600
sell them on to

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
uh the dark web so that that's quite

138
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,880
similar with the

139
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
physical attacks but in the digital

140
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,160
world

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,039
and a bit more context um

142
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,240
that their targets are usually

143
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,800
medium-sized or small-sized web stops

144
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,039
and that's probably

145
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,199
because uh these types of uh

146
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,840
websobs are not focusing

147
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,919
uh as much on security as bigger

148
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,840
corporations do and that's what the

149
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,400
image on the right is uh

150
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,240
is all about it

151
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,759
it tries to show that

152
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,280
there is a broad spectrum of uh of types

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,520
of webshops that are being attacked with

154
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,840
a special focus on miscellaneous and

155
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,320
special aspects for me means smaller

156
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
medium-sized web soaps

157
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,120
uh traditionally the magento platform

158
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
has been a

159
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,400
target of their attacks and that's why

160
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,639
the magento platform has been used to

161
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,520
create it can be used to create

162
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,560
exactly this type of web shops

163
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,479
small and medium-sized and by finding a

164
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,000
vulnerability there of course they are

165
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
able to hack hundreds maybe thousands of

166
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,880
websites at the same time and then

167
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,039
deploy their schema codes

168
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,319
but that's not that's not the whole

169
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,080
story

170
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,360
they have also some more popular targets

171
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,199
which include macy's british airways

172
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,160
ticketmaster forbes and so on

173
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,840
and characteristics of these attacks

174
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,880
that

175
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,319
are that they are hard to identify

176
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,759
you have to be monitoring you have to

177
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,280
realize that something happens in the

178
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,680
production that's that's not really

179
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,800
straightforward as it as it sounds

180
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,400
it might be hard to notify victims uh

181
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
and to notify the companies being

182
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,639
affected the bank might reside in one

183
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,479
country and the website made microsite

184
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,080
in another country that makes it really

185
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,720
hard for law enforcement to to actually

186
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,919
do it

187
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,039
uh it's job and everything will probably

188
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,120
end up in dark web

189
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,960
where there are specialized uh

190
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,440
dark web websites that are

191
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,800
selling

192
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,599
maybe even schema code itself but also

193
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,639
storing credit cards

194
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,160
[Music]

195
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,319
as a result of their attacks there have

196
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,319
been some headlines in in the news

197
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,080
british airways they were initially

198
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,520
fined with

199
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,800
a huge uh fine of uh i think it was

200
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,560
around 183 million uh british pounds or

201
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,319
something

202
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,080
that was later reduced to 20 million

203
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,199
still quite a substantial amount and

204
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,840
ticketmaster also had to take

205
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,680
their own fine for their breaches by

206
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,639
maidscard and these figures of course do

207
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,879
not include settlements and damages that

208
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,479
have to be paid to victims uh legal fees

209
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,240
included

210
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
uh and of course the damage and

211
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,319
reputation that you cannot really put a

212
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,039
dollar value

213
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,160
let's start getting a bit a little bit

214
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,440
more technical

215
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,160
so what happens in in practice you have

216
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,720
a payments form

217
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,360
and what happens is

218
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,080
the victim will go in uh fill in the

219
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,840
critical information the name on the

220
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,080
creditor the cbc code and so on

221
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,240
and on this page you obviously are

222
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,840
running javascript

223
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,520
the worldwide web is running on

224
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,360
javascript more or less

225
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,160
and this javascript of course translates

226
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
to

227
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,840
the code to source code that

228
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,240
instructs the browser on

229
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,159
how to

230
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,640
to to react to inputs to the payment

231
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,880
form and so on that's like how how it

232
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,559
works what these criminals will do now

233
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,919
and this is the critical point is that

234
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,519
they will find their way in they will

235
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,760
bridge security somehow

236
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
we will check a few cases

237
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,680
and they will inject their schema code

238
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,160
and that schema code is what will listen

239
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,600
to whatever you're

240
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,000
inputting in your payments form and then

241
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,560
send it to the drop server as we have

242
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,760
already

243
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,080
discussed so that's like the

244
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,839
bigger picture of how these attacks

245
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,040
work and they usually

246
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
choose to inject this schema code in

247
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,320
existing scripts because it makes

248
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,440
detection even harder

249
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
now let's take a look at the first case

250
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
that is the prettiest case selection the

251
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
most famous case and the

252
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,560
characteristic of this attack is that

253
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,040
this was an attack

254
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,080
uh targeting british airways and only 37

255
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,800
from the magento platform where

256
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,240
you know you find a vulnerability in the

257
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,760
platform and then this is exploitable in

258
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,120
thousands of

259
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,920
websites that's that's another case here

260
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
they went directly for british airways

261
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
infrastructure because they found some

262
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,240
kind of vulnerability and they breached

263
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,560
pretty surveys and that attacked the

264
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,800
bridge the actual bits happened about a

265
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,320
week

266
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,480
before the actual skimming attack

267
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,440
started as we known so far and we know

268
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
that because

269
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,560
a certificate was bought from a

270
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,240
comodo

271
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,519
was registered about a week before the

272
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,800
actual

273
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,800
skimming attack now parenthesis open um

274
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,959
the actual fact that they could

275
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,839
acquire a certificate from uh from

276
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,800
komodo and register uh

277
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,320
ba waste.com domain uh for their own use

278
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,000
that looks a lot like we would say with

279
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,480
domains but it is not is

280
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,519
maybe a topic for a whole another talk

281
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,320
but yeah

282
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,880
parenthesis closed

283
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,440
uh in this particular

284
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
case they went for

285
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,000
script modernizer because that probably

286
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,160
felt

287
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,000
very strong inform so payments webpages

288
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
of british airways

289
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
they were by hacking the website they

290
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,120
were able also to hack the

291
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,200
mobile application of 3d service because

292
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,399
the mobile application was actually

293
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,519
mirroring parts of the webpage so

294
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,079
the schema code was also affecting the

295
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,720
the mobile application

296
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,120
and

297
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,200
as a result of

298
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,160
of this attack 380 000 victims

299
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,240
were

300
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
lost credit card information to the

301
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,560
attackers and that happened because of

302
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,399
22 lines of code

303
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,600
and this is what these 22 lines of code

304
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,519
looked like this is the de-obfuscated

305
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,839
form

306
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,640
the actual schema code and

307
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,079
we don't really have to be at java needs

308
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,800
our javascript means that to

309
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,200
understand what is going on here this is

310
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,079
like an action that is binded to

311
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,040
the submit button on the payment form

312
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,440
uh so as as a victim you would go and

313
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,000
you will fill in your information and by

314
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,399
the time you release your click from the

315
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,880
submit button or your your touch from

316
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,839
the

317
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,839
from your

318
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,720
touchpad from the button and this what

319
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,160
this functionality does is that it

320
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,880
serializes the the form where you have

321
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,399
input your critical information your

322
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,560
name your cvc code and so on

323
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,639
it will serialize all the information

324
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,519
and just post it we will do an http post

325
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,519
to this baoz

326
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,440
dot com domain that is the drop server

327
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,639
that

328
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,839
the mates card

329
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,040
will use to collect all

330
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,440
stolen credit card information

331
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,360
simple straightforward effective

332
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,920
characteristic piece of these types of

333
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,760
attacks

334
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,680
let's move on and look at yet another

335
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,320
case from ticketmaster

336
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,519
this case

337
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,000
i want to pick up because it

338
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,959
looks

339
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,320
uh

340
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,480
it shares some characteristics with the

341
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,639
previous case of course they went after

342
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,320
the credit information and they use the

343
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,880
drop server and so on but instead of

344
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,200
going directly for

345
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,680
ticketmaster like hacking directly in

346
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,880
their

347
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,079
infrastructure they went

348
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,560
through a third party provider in this

349
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
case in benta

350
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,079
which was a provider of uh functionality

351
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,320
uh as a third party

352
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,600
so ticketmaster was injecting their

353
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,959
scripts

354
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,600
from their own domain into their

355
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,959
ticketmaster

356
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,279
websites so what the hackers did is that

357
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,079
they

358
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,880
blitzed inventor injected their schema

359
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
code in their scripts so

360
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,120
the actual schema code got reflected in

361
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,800
ticketmaster

362
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,160
web pages

363
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,360
and in this particular case they did not

364
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,240
just inject their schema code in one

365
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,600
script they

366
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,320
they had chosen several scripts to

367
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,399
to inject their schema code and probably

368
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,160
because that's how they felt

369
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,639
functionality for for them would work

370
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
better

371
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,199
and yeah as a result

372
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,959
the schema code was working and credit

373
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,959
cards were being

374
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,439
stolen

375
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,360
so let's

376
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,040
make a quick

377
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,199
summary of what we discussed so far

378
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,199
these attacks happen through

379
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,839
javascript that's like the main

380
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:24,720
path

381
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
to deliver the

382
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,680
means to deliver the attack

383
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,040
they might go

384
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,720
through a platform

385
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,959
that the website is being built on

386
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,720
finding

387
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,399
exploitable

388
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,360
uh

389
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
problems there and then affecting

390
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,959
thousands of websites or they might go

391
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,880
directly for

392
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,680
uh

393
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,079
infrastructure if that's a more

394
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,720
like a bigger target a bigger victim

395
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,279
they are interested in and they fight

396
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,279
they are quite opportunistic right so

397
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,040
they they find an opportunity they will

398
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,720
they will take advantage of that or they

399
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,079
might even use

400
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,800
third-party providers or advertisements

401
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,040
or something that are being reflected in

402
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,360
your webpage and by hacking them they

403
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,000
are able to hack

404
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,160
the actual victim they are going after

405
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,360
so

406
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,000
i would like to take a brief discussion

407
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,199
on

408
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,880
what is already out there

409
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,839
about the detection which is the main

410
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,240
the high point of this of this talk

411
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,560
uh first of all security basics

412
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,880
and security hygiene is

413
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,399
very important

414
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,160
patching of course

415
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,720
keeping the infrastructure at the latest

416
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,000
version

417
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,560
uh is like the bottom line that every

418
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,959
security team every company should be

419
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,959
doing that if you're not doing that then

420
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,880
you're obviously doing something really

421
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,959
wrong with security

422
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,959
and the equivalent to patching invest

423
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,920
structures of course for the software

424
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,800
world

425
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,720
keeping your third party components open

426
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
source components uh components up to

427
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,240
date because that makes sure you do not

428
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,759
have any known vulnerabilities

429
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,959
at least

430
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,480
in your running applications

431
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,519
another important aspect is that

432
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,440
it's pretty nice to assess the risk of

433
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,680
third-party providers

434
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,360
that means doing your due diligence for

435
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,519
the code uh the functionality that

436
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
you're actually integrating into your

437
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,560
own

438
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,880
platforms and your own websites

439
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,920
and and then there are

440
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,399
a bit more technical

441
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,070
ways to

442
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,560
[Music]

443
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:42,790
and

444
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,890
[Music]

445
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,279
differences and that is content security

446
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,279
and you're not aware with what content

447
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,920
security policy is simply put it is a

448
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
way to instruct your

449
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,639
web browser on which domains

450
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,440
can run

451
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,319
scripts can

452
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,599
css on your own web page so by doing

453
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,799
that you

454
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,799
make the life

455
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,480
harder

456
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,880
and then in case you need to run inline

457
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
skates there are also ways to

458
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,559
to essentially assign an identity uh

459
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,839
in

460
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,199
on your inline script

461
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,119
that the browser can check if that

462
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,160
changes

463
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,600
the identity will not match and it will

464
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,440
block your

465
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
inline skip from running there are two

466
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,640
ways to do that we will not talk details

467
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,480
you may google that further on that's

468
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,039
non-source and hazards on how to do that

469
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,280
uh and in the case of third-party

470
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,840
providers or cdns or loading scripts

471
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,120
from another domain there's also some

472
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,760
precious integrity

473
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,520
which includes an identity or an

474
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,120
integrity code

475
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,360
for the script you are

476
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,200
injecting from a third party provider

477
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,039
and if that

478
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,679
code changes on the third part provider

479
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,039
the integrity

480
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,320
will also change and the state will be

481
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,240
stopped from executing

482
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,760
and we will

483
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,080
talk what uh we talked a bit about what

484
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,840
hassing is in just a

485
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,039
second so

486
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,679
there are tools there are ways to at

487
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,799
least make

488
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,039
the life of the attacker

489
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,400
way harder

490
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,880
uh there might be ways that they can

491
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,600
circumvent these defenses but

492
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,360
that would be

493
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,600
way more difficult to do

494
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,440
compared to not having

495
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,720
of course especially constituted

496
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,799
policies and subjects

497
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,200
because passing and keeping third party

498
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,600
components up to date is a must for for

499
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,120
everyone

500
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,600
uh but i i would like to take a moment a

501
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,400
bit about detection uh these methods

502
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,280
that we have just talked about uh is

503
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
they are not present everywhere and

504
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,400
there is a good reason for that

505
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
they

506
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,240
there are means there are ways to to

507
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,679
implement them but it's not

508
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,440
straightforward for all development

509
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,480
teams so

510
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,080
there might be that your development

511
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,520
teams if you're working in a bigger

512
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,640
corporation

513
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,799
i do not have the education

514
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,600
needed to to actually implement this

515
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,200
they might not have the resources to do

516
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,039
that and if you're a

517
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,280
developer working for

518
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,840
a smaller company that maybe administers

519
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,280
several

520
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,840
smaller websites then you might be also

521
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,679
missing the education do that or you

522
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,640
might not have time to do that

523
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,360
so

524
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,559
the reasons

525
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,880
can differ from company to company so as

526
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
talking about myself as well as an

527
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,200
application security or an i.t security

528
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,120
specialist

529
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,880
i

530
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,440
i would really love to have a way to

531
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,760
keep an eye on what is happening on the

532
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,679
production of my company without

533
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,120
relying uh on on others

534
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,960
so i would like to have a way to do the

535
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,919
detection on with my own tools and my my

536
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,799
own means and that's what

537
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,200
this talk is about uh presenting a

538
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,360
method to detect

539
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,520
digital scheming attacks

540
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,200
uh being separate being detached from

541
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,760
uh well from developer teams and then

542
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,400
getting to it on on your own

543
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,039
and the means to do that the way to do

544
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,400
that uh is through one way has functions

545
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,559
uh and you don't need to

546
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,679
know

547
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,559
too much details or too much

548
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,799
crypto in order to understand what the

549
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,360
cryptographic one has functions are

550
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,760
simply put again it's

551
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,919
a cryptographic function on a pre-image

552
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,080
the premise can actually be an actual

553
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,320
image so it can be source code it can be

554
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,080
text or whatever so that's called the

555
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
pre-meds you apply

556
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,240
that one-way hash function on that three

557
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,640
image and you get a hash value you get a

558
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,240
hash in the end

559
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,799
and this house value will be

560
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,520
unique for its three images so you

561
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,600
change the pretty much the hash changes

562
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,880
as well

563
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,440
that's the main functionality and you go

564
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,600
fast from the payments to the house but

565
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,120
it's not as easy to go backwards

566
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,799
so how do we apply that

567
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,960
back to the example where you are

568
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
loading some javascript with source code

569
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,600
of course on your web pages you get the

570
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,240
source code and you apply a one-way

571
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,840
function on that

572
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,480
piece of code in this case i'm giving an

573
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,280
example that star 236 which is one of

574
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,679
the available uh cryptographic hash

575
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,039
function that you can

576
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,559
use so you get the output you get the

577
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,320
hash value right

578
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,400
at a later stage let's suppose that an

579
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
attacker is injecting code

580
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,640
but you're repeating this process you're

581
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,360
taking the source code again and you are

582
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,400
applying cryptographic

583
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,120
function on that source code and then

584
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,240
you get

585
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,720
the hash value if you compare that new

586
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,640
house value to the old one you will

587
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,880
realize that it changed and that's

588
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,000
because the source code changed so that

589
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,640
is a way to detect that something

590
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880
happened in your production that's a way

591
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,200
to detect that the source code changed

592
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,559
and that's

593
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,320
a security event that needs to be

594
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,039
investigated further

595
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,919
so

596
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,320
in order to automate this process what i

597
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
did is that i

598
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,400
i created a

599
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,679
github project that i call suricata js

600
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,159
from the lovely animal no it's always on

601
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,960
its toes and alert

602
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,039
it's written in python it's a really

603
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,960
simple it's not a very

604
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,520
advanced piece of code you can

605
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,559
you're very welcome to extend overwrite

606
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,950
totally destroy uh or use it

607
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,799
[Music]

608
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,200
it's open source

609
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,280
and the functionality is

610
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,360
at forums it takes an input in a

611
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,360
target.txt file where you provide

612
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,760
the urls that you're interested in

613
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,000
monitoring in your production

614
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,880
and what it will do is that it will scan

615
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,360
this whole web page it will identify

616
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,240
inline scripts reference scripts and so

617
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,280
on

618
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,360
and if it doesn't exist in

619
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,520
its database this clip it will hash it

620
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,080
and put in the database if the script

621
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,240
has been checked before and exists in

622
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,480
the database with its hash value it will

623
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,799
recompute the hash value and compare to

624
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,360
the one that exists in your database

625
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,960
and if they don't match it will create

626
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,559
an alert

627
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,480
so that's like the

628
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
functionality of

629
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,440
uh surigata js and at this point i think

630
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,520
i

631
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,120
have the the time to show you a demo

632
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,320
uh so what i did is that i created a

633
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,480
very simple

634
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,360
uh

635
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,919
payments form on my localhost where you

636
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,080
are supposed to go in and provide your

637
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,919
credit information

638
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,880
and what this page does is that it

639
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,000
simply runs a javascript code that says

640
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,400
yeah thank you for submitting your

641
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,320
credit information that's like this

642
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
piece of code seen here that's very

643
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,279
simple just an alert

644
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,640
and

645
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,559
so what i will do now is that i will

646
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,320
go back to my visual studio code and i

647
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,120
will run sorry kata

648
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,039
i have already done that as you

649
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,559
see above but

650
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,640
just i i added some verbose uh

651
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,400
output here that says

652
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,520
i found your script

653
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,240
and the checksum that already exists in

654
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,159
the database this this one and max the

655
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,480
database so nothing to worry about here

656
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,279
right

657
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,120
now suppose my website is getting

658
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,000
bridged and i will act as

659
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,080
the attacker

660
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,799
and i will simply add

661
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,440
the space of skimmer code

662
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,600
and what it does is that it takes

663
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,799
the

664
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,760
uh

665
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,600
web form

666
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,320
that we see

667
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,720
and it just

668
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,679
sends that to

669
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,640
a webhook site so that's my my job

670
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,480
server right so

671
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,559
let's do that

672
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,320
let's suppose i'm buying something

673
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,039
and yeah

674
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,120
that's how

675
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,840
it looks like

676
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,279
it's uh

677
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,960
i'm getting the

678
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,320
input i inserted and the cc number and

679
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,080
expire so that's like

680
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,799
how the schemer code would

681
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,360
uh would look like and what the

682
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,120
collection of the credit card

683
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,960
information on the drop server would

684
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,080
look like

685
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,480
now what do we do as a defender if i run

686
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,400
surikata

687
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,240
again

688
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,799
it will detect the change so it tells me

689
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,840
that warning

690
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,799
a new hash value has been detected which

691
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,039
doesn't match the records in our

692
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,559
database please start out and that's

693
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,520
more or less what suicata

694
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,840
does

695
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,080
let's go back to the

696
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,600
presentation because i

697
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,960
think i have one more slide so yes

698
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,039
so as i said you're very welcome to

699
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,400
provide feedback

700
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,520
extend

701
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,240
help me out further uh developing this

702
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,200
uh

703
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,640
tool

704
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,400
and one piece of advice on how to

705
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,640
integrate that in your

706
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,720
existing monitoring platforms if you're

707
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,200
interesting is alerts for yourself not

708
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,279
fun i've done it myself since i've seen

709
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,799
colleagues doing that

710
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,080
and this is a tool that creates some

711
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,640
security warnings right that can inform

712
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,159
you that something

713
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,640
could be wrong in your production uh in

714
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,200
relation to mates card attacks

715
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,679
uh add thought into the system where

716
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,000
you're communicating with others in my

717
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,320
company that is

718
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,480
microsoft teams so what i did for my

719
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,279
company is that i added a specific post

720
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,960
function that posts

721
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,799
in web teams when

722
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,720
an alert is created and in this case i'm

723
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,279
showing it at the bottom of the page and

724
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,799
a false positive

725
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,960
you will get that also

726
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,840
uh that informs me and the developers

727
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,440
that we are together in this channel

728
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,919
that something happened on uh on our

729
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,919
production

730
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,440
uh and with that i think i

731
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,320
can

732
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,799
say thank you to you for being

733
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,960
here and if you have any questions i

734
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,640
would be happy to

735
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,799
to answer
