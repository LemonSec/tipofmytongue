2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,599
hello everyone

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,360
hi

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,799
uh this is uh

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,799
ray and malcolm

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,880
and uh malcolm's actually gonna run the

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,720
the slideshow so but i'll talk for this

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,520
part

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,760
um i'm the director of f5 labs and

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
malcolm is a researcher with f5 labs

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,240
we've both been with f5 for a long time

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,359
malcolm

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,640
many many many years as you've heard

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,880
f5 labs is actually the threat research

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,120
wing of f5 so

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,000
we uh got a bunch of cool data to share

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,399
with you today so let's just get on with

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,079
it should go to the next slide please

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,440
so we have a partnership with effluxio

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,920
who's run by many different names lorica

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,520
baffin bay now they're called deflexio

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,360
but it's essentially the same folks that

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,160
we've been working with since 2017 and

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,199
they have a

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,520
global honeypot network

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,480
and

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,319
we collect a lot of data from them and

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,519
various things and one of the things

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,119
that we really single

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,000
our attention on is their web sensors

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,200
their web attacks so we actually have

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,960
um it says variable number of sensors

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,360
it's easily to say in the hundreds

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,119
uh all over the world

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,360
and we see as you see 11 000 events per

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,280
day on average and that's just the web

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
attacks and we actually are able to

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,439
capture a bunch of data uh what these

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,400
honeypots do is they actually simulate a

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,720
a web server in the most basic sense

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,640
they see an incoming connection

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,159
and they kind of answer like yeah yeah i

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,079
speak port 80 here's here's you know my

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,720
http and then we grab that session

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,880
and then they shovel all that data to us

46
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,479
and so we've been doing various stories

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,560
and analysis on upcoming attack trends

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,079
and things like that and kind of

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,200
interesting events so we'll get into

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
that as we go along

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,880
but we also decided we were you know for

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,399
the special 20th anniversary we wanted

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,560
to do like a big picture let's look at

54
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,200
all the data we had so we have 8.5

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,640
million events

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,880
and and malcolm crunched through it and

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,119
found some really interesting things

58
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,399
and we're also going to talk a little

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,318
bit about the process that we did

60
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,679
because i think that's also interesting

61
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,680
and useful to you especially if you want

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,280
to be doing some of this stuff on your

63
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,640
own as well

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,120
uh go ahead to the next one

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,640
which i think

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,200
uh yeah that's where i took over yeah so

67
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800
i i can talk a little bit about some of

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,160
the tooling that was used for the

69
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,920
analysis um

70
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
we use a pretty standard set of data

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
analysis tools uh python uh including

72
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,239
libraries like pandas and numpy

73
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,760
jupiter jupiter notebooks um some are uh

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,800
and most recently elasticsearch and uh

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
elasticsearch has been really

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,040
extremely helpful when uh when i

77
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
approach this project to not just do an

78
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,800
analysis of a relatively limited time

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,120
period like say a month or a quarter but

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
instead tried to look at this

81
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,599
entire data set that covered years

82
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,319
that gave us the scaling that we needed

83
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,239
originally the data was in comma

84
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,200
separated values and now it's in json

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,360
there's pros and cons to both uh some

86
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,840
tools work better with some and others

87
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,879
with others

88
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,519
it's been relatively easy to to

89
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,640
transform the data between the two as we

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,080
needed to

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,599
but if you were designing a system like

92
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,599
this yourself i would probably

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,120
recommend that you

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,319
consider json as being the more flexible

95
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,599
uh format for it

96
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,599
we've managed to come up with automated

97
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,760
ingestion uh it's approaching real time

98
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,200
we're at about a day now um about a day

99
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,599
lag uh we're hoping to be able to get it

100
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,760
down to hourly or even just direct

101
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,159
pipelining into our analysis

102
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,080
infrastructure

103
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,760
so that we can start doing some really

104
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,239
good automated analysis on it um we've

105
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,599
obviously done a fair amount of trends

106
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,519
over time looking at different attack

107
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,000
patterns but what we would like to do is

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,799
to

109
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,760
use this as a source to be able to

110
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,480
profile the attack patterns for example

111
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,360
urls that we're seeing um

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,879
you know get request urls uh that we're

113
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,280
seeing and start to

114
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,640
uh

115
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,040
in a probably using some sort of machine

116
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,480
learning you know classify them

117
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,358
automatically and detect anomalies as we

118
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,120
go forward so that we can see new attack

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
patterns coming forth

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,080
that will also uh using some of the

121
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,759
other fields that we have allow us to do

122
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,120
some attacker profiling where are they

123
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
coming from what time are they coming in

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,440
from what asn are they coming in from

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,600
that sort of thing

126
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,759
and we also have geolocation data which

127
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,000
would allow us to do uh more regional

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,840
reports both on where scans are coming

129
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
from and where they're heading to

130
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,160
some of the challenges that we've faced

131
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,800
uh is essentially that over time when

132
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
you're looking at a data set this large

133
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,479
um we were looking at different pieces

134
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,639
of data earlier than we are later we've

135
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,040
added the things that we are capturing

136
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
we've uh changed around some of the ways

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,639
that we captured that data

138
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,240
so there was a fair amount of data

139
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
cleaning and and uh coalescing that

140
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,000
needed to be done

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
um obviously also as ray mentioned we

142
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,840
have a couple of hundred sensors minimum

143
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,400
but that number has actually gone up

144
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,160
significantly and the more sensors we

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,440
have

146
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,000
uh the harder it is to ingest the data

147
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,919
that we're getting um the web data set

148
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,960
is

149
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,440
as these things go relatively small but

150
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,199
we also have some other data sets that

151
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,000
are probably in order of magnitude um or

152
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,880
two

153
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,000
larger

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
um and that starts getting a little bit

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,320
difficult to do without some pretty

156
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,560
serious infrastructure behind it

157
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,440
it's just quite a lot of data

158
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,199
uh right now the classification of the

159
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,680
web attacks that we're seeing uh in

160
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,000
terms of like what does this

161
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,639
request represent in terms of an attack

162
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,960
is a mainly manual process

163
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,120
uh and we're hoping as i said to

164
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
automate that but that was a bit of a

165
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,880
chore to go through

166
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,720
even the relatively limited set that we

167
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,919
had here

168
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,600
uh and come up with some sort of

169
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,080
reasonable classification scheme

170
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,000
and there are of course costs associated

171
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,400
with maintaining the sensors storing all

172
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,160
the data in a way that you can get to it

173
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,919
easily and do your analysis

174
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,759
uh and also just preserving it over the

175
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,000
long term i think an awful lot of

176
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,319
companies have much of the same sort of

177
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,280
data

178
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,600
from say their web application firewall

179
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
or their logs even but they don't

180
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
necessarily keep five

181
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,400
ten years worth of it to be able to do

182
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,919
this sort of trending that we're gonna

183
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,080
do

184
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,800
so we started off by classifying the

185
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
attacks and in order to be able to talk

186
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,160
about this i think i need to define a

187
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
little bit more about what the sensors

188
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,120
can

189
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,240
do and what they also what they don't do

190
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,560
none of these sensors have dns hostnames

191
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,160
they're not pretending to be a specific

192
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,039
company or a specific vertical or

193
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,400
you know um

194
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,560
bob's uh

195
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,240
happy fun web

196
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,759
site or whatever it happens to be

197
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,520
there's there's no particular thing

198
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,039
they're really just an ip address

199
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,360
hanging out on the internet waiting for

200
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,840
traffic to arrive to them

201
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,599
they additionally don't pretend to be a

202
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,280
specific platform they're not pretending

203
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,800
to be an apache with php or an nginx uh

204
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,639
or something that has you know

205
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,160
javascript on it or anything else like

206
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,319
that they're really just a listener

207
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,120
listening on port 80 and port 443

208
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,599
able to receive an http or tls

209
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,759
connection negotiated properly and

210
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,240
record the request that comes in

211
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,000
that's literally it um so what does this

212
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,919
give us in terms of the visibility into

213
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,599
what's happening on the internet and the

214
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,880
web

215
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,599
it gives us the ability to see

216
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,199
scans that are

217
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,800
widely and non-specifically targeted

218
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,280
these are scans that are probably going

219
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,919
and traversing a large section of the ip

220
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,680
space

221
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
they are not targeted to specific

222
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,879
companies they're not targeted to

223
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,000
specific domains they are really just

224
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,720
going and perhaps scanning

225
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
you know a class a at a time or

226
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,319
something like that that probably dates

227
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,000
me a little bit but

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,039
a large number of ip addresses at a time

229
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,879
and so it's reasonable to conclude that

230
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,720
the attacks are automated and are done

231
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,000
at scale

232
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,120
and are probably done therefore uh by

233
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,039
attackers who are looking for easy wins

234
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,720
they're they're not necessarily

235
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,400
targeting a specific

236
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,560
industry or site they are just trying to

237
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,720
find things that they can

238
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,919
break into

239
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,879
or

240
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,639
install software on which we'll get to

241
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,599
in a little bit or

242
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,200
retrieve information from

243
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
that classification

244
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,360
is uh

245
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
the next thing really that we looked at

246
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
um and as i said um what we've generally

247
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,839
seen and and i think this is actually

248
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,360
probably true

249
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,519
for a large amount of attacks on the

250
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,720
internet

251
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,800
is that attackers are going to target

252
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,959
technologies and not necessarily

253
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,760
industries um they are

254
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,839
picking up public vulnerabilities

255
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,279
quickly

256
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,519
those get weaponized automated and start

257
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,040
being used

258
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,959
and they continue being used for a very

259
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,600
long time as we'll see

260
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
um the most apparent goals that we've

261
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,440
been able to determine from what we've

262
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,519
seen and this is mainly from

263
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,920
command injection payloads is they are

264
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,680
interested in

265
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,160
uh installing crypto miners uh or

266
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,120
building botnets uh and

267
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
probably the most common botnet that

268
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,000
we've seen

269
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,880
uh

270
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,480
general classification of botnet i

271
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,680
should say

272
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,560
is for doing denial of service attacks

273
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,880
such as the xrd does

274
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,000
um

275
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
many of these attacks can be automated

276
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,560
completely you see that you see a get

277
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,959
request comes in that uses a command

278
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,600
injection that issues a curl command

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,920
that downloads something from some

280
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,240
server somewhere untards it somewhere

281
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,399
and starts running it and and you can do

282
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,959
that all on one get request

283
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,839
secondarily we see a lot of attempts at

284
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,360
going and looking for files that would

285
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,200
reveal credentials

286
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,680
dot env for example where um

287
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
unfortunately you find a lot of database

288
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,200
credentials

289
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,000
or general configuration files that make

290
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,440
may include passwords or key data

291
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,399
and so from this we conclude that um

292
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,760
at least this particular subset of

293
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,079
attackers are going to be using

294
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,079
the shortest path to their goal and

295
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,680
their goal is

296
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,680
widespread

297
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,760
and information theft

298
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,200
so they're not going to be particularly

299
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,279
picky about what tools or technologies

300
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,680
they use

301
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,720
so now we can talk a little bit about

302
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,240
what sort of attacks you might be

303
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,399
expecting and we can say generally that

304
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,040
any http or tls endpoint will be scanned

305
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,200
probably within less than one hour of it

306
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,120
being visible

307
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,440
um and your authentication endpoints

308
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,079
will be cred stuffed and brute forced if

309
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,720
it's got a login box on it that can be

310
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
exercised by a remote attacker it's

311
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,000
going to be exercised by a remote

312
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,839
attacker

313
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,320
any data that's in the open is going to

314
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,600
be found and taken

315
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,399
um

316
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
specifically php

317
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,800
will be enumerated for command injection

318
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,160
vulnerabilities

319
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
uh we see a ton

320
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,680
of requests for common test script names

321
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,000
you know for example test.php

322
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,240
or shell.php

323
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,880
or

324
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,120
aaa.php or temp.php any of these sorts

325
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,240
of things which i assume is attackers

326
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,839
looking for

327
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,279
people

328
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,399
coming up with a quick little test

329
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,440
script

330
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,519
leaving it out in the open and perhaps

331
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,720
being able to find something that they

332
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,160
can exercise to

333
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,519
to do a command injection most likely

334
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,880
interestingly

335
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,320
api specific api urls in other words

336
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,800
ones that comply to a format that

337
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,920
indicates an api endpoint uh slash api

338
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,200
would be the most common one obviously

339
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,959
but there's many other patterns that we

340
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,160
see

341
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,399
are being actively scanned for they're

342
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,240
going to be found and they're gonna get

343
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,839
poked at quite uh sufficiently

344
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,839
and finally uh

345
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,959
any public web vulnerability any cve

346
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,279
that comes out that anybody has any idea

347
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,040
about how to actually use

348
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
are going to be picked up quickly

349
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,279
turned into an automated

350
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,760
uh tool and you're going to see those

351
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,240
all the time

352
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,279
i'm just going to pause briefly okay

353
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,320
thank you for the time warning

354
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,240
so

355
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,320
in order to take a look at this data

356
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,440
over this large chunk of time

357
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
we use the hauling approach

358
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,920
we looked for the top 50 requested uris

359
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,360
per month

360
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,040
uh 2017-21 inclusive uh until just a

361
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,279
little while ago in mid-august

362
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,360
actually um yeah a little while ago

363
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,560
mid-august

364
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,079
we normalized it for the number of

365
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,040
sensors so that we had comparable data

366
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,480
sets

367
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,279
and we did some manual classification

368
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,200
we broke it out this way we came up with

369
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,639
apis

370
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,399
specifically the enumeration and

371
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,279
attempted execution of apis

372
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,480
authentication

373
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,880
um which is request for login pages or

374
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,800
specific login attempts post requests

375
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,920
with credential data in them

376
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,800
we looked for code and content inclusion

377
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,720
which i'm defining here as cross-site

378
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,560
scripting local file inclusion remote

379
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,320
file inclusion and several other

380
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,720
techniques

381
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,279
information theft and recon which is as

382
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,600
i mentioned looking for for example env

383
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,120
files or

384
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
dot password files or dot hd access

385
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,560
files those sorts of things

386
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,880
injection and remote command execution

387
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
specifically command injection most

388
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,320
often but also specific remote code

389
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,399
execution vulnerabilities

390
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,920
and then finally

391
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,800
sql injection which we separated out

392
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
from injection

393
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,199
more generally because we saw in the

394
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,079
data

395
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,680
a really interesting pattern emerge

396
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,320
so here's what we saw

397
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,480
over obviously on the left we have 2017

398
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,959
all the way to the right 2021.

399
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,880
the green color on your screen is what

400
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,600
we observed for sql injection attacks

401
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,240
and as you can see they were by far

402
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,120
the majority of the attacks that we saw

403
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,639
from when our data set started in 2017

404
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,000
until

405
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,240
about july of 2018

406
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,199
and

407
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,040
they were ubiquitous

408
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,600
there was just so many of them

409
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,000
um code and content inclusion did have a

410
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,519
representation in there as well as

411
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,120
authentication some of the other

412
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,040
categories here

413
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,680
then we saw a really big shift there was

414
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,480
a sudden spike in injection

415
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,440
rce classified attacks and

416
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,880
i think we're going to figure out

417
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,399
exactly what those were here in a couple

418
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,760
of slides

419
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,320
but after that point you'll notice over

420
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,399
on the right side of the graph

421
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,399
especially with the orange which is off

422
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,440
and the blue which is api a significant

423
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,839
and ever-increasing trend

424
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,680
for scans that we're targeting those two

425
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,160
classifications

426
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,279
i think this is really really

427
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,120
interesting um

428
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
what we may be seeing here and this is

429
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,880
speculation but what we may be seeing

430
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,560
here is

431
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,680
a shift from using traditional sql

432
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,000
backed web architectures to perhaps ones

433
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,240
using nosql

434
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,160
or perhaps just people fixing sql

435
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
vulnerabilities

436
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,959
which made those attacks less

437
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,720
likely to succeed

438
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,880
and at the same time we see an

439
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,720
increasing amount

440
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,399
of api usage

441
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,399
uh and also

442
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,720
attackers just pivoting to what they can

443
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,880
reasonably conclude that they can get in

444
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,160
with uh in other words api cred stuffing

445
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,600
password spraying

446
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,240
all those sorts of techniques

447
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,639
the infos the info theft and recon

448
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,600
category has been growing as well

449
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,360
um and the injection rce has uh

450
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,800
continued to be something that we've

451
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,079
seen a lot of

452
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,079
but i'm really want to call out that

453
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,480
specific trend of increases in off and

454
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
api traffic because i really think that

455
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,720
that's actually where

456
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,199
that's a major shift that we're seeing

457
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,040
um it may be

458
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,079
that

459
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,279
uh

460
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,959
some older techniques that attackers are

461
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,120
using are less effective

462
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,519
um but they are definitely keeping up

463
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,600
with the shifts in web architecture that

464
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,519
we're seeing where apis and

465
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,440
microservices and that sort of thing are

466
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,560
becoming

467
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,759
more common

468
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,320
and they are definitely arising into the

469
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,120
uh the targeting that attackers are

470
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,880
doing here

471
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,839
so

472
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,759
we found a couple of just to call out a

473
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,959
couple of different things that we found

474
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,720
that were kind of interesting um cve

475
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,400
2017 80 9841 apologies was actually

476
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,160
found in 2017.

477
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,480
it emerged strongly in 2019.

478
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,720
um we caught it uh about halfway through

479
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
september in 2019.

480
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,520
um

481
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,599
it's been continuous in our data set

482
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,919
since october 2020.

483
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,919
now um it peaked somewhere in there

484
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,319
but it still continues to this day

485
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,240
and uh it's still quite significant

486
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,320
which i think is interesting because one

487
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,880
would assume that uh such an old cpe

488
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,039
would perhaps fall out of the data set

489
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,880
that attackers are using but it's not

490
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,000
happening

491
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
uh they continue to use it now whether

492
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,520
this is because it's easier just to

493
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,960
leave it in

494
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,760
or

495
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,520
whether it's actually still being

496
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,960
effective

497
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,720
i don't actually know

498
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,080
my suspicion is probably more than

499
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,760
latter

500
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,440
generally speaking attackers are pretty

501
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,280
good about optimizing

502
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,320
what they're doing for efficiency

503
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,760
and when you're scanning large chunks of

504
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,280
the internet that becomes an important

505
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,400
thing

506
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,360
so um i'm expecting that this particular

507
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,120
cde is probably something that they're

508
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,640
still finding some um instances of

509
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,840
cv 2019

510
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,440
11510 does actually tell a slightly

511
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,360
different story which is this was a

512
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,919
a vulnerability in the um

513
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,120
pulse secure ssl vpn it was a critical

514
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,160
uh the cvs score of 10.

515
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,559
um we saw it first at the very beginning

516
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,760
of august uh it had a huge spike

517
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
right after that in mid-august

518
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,160
um scans continue to this day but at a

519
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,960
much lower level

520
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,120
and uh just to correlate that a tiny bit

521
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,679
uh that might actually be corresponding

522
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,600
to that august

523
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,480
um

524
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,200
some of these actually

525
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,720
oh no i'm sorry i'm getting this a

526
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,480
little bit confused

527
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,240
some of this definitely accounts for um

528
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,080
the spikes that you see actually that

529
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,000
first blue spike there

530
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,240
um especially the 2019 11510

531
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
was definitely present within that

532
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,240
two-month span where you see the first

533
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,200
big light blue spike

534
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,039
now with that i'm going to hand it over

535
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,400
to ray to talk about a few other

536
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,600
interesting things that we've found

537
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,840
ah thank you i'm going to kind of go

538
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,360
through these a little quicker because

539
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
we're kind of running out of time here

540
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,720
but uh you know also you can see the

541
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,799
links in the bottom of the site here's

542
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,080
or the

543
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,440
video so you can actually go to the site

544
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,120
and see the longer versions of these

545
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,200
little stories

546
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,880
um one of the things we did when we

547
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,320
first started analyzing this data is we

548
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,400
saw this huge spike of php attacks now

549
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,160
we see a lot of php

550
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,240
um but actually starting to

551
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,400
one of our other researchers uh sander

552
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,799
vindenberg who works on the uh protect

553
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,640
report found was these are actually

554
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,720
coming just from two servers

555
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,240
uh two particular servers at a north

556
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,400
american university and just targeting a

557
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,480
couple of cves but these things were

558
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,160
pretty much swamping our data to the

559
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,360
point where we actually had to take them

560
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,120
out of our data set and separate them

561
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,240
just so that we could see everything

562
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,280
else because they were pushing

563
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,880
everything back down

564
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,320
but it kind of goes to show that like

565
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,760
you know there are boxes out there that

566
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,840
just go crazy and they just run crazy

567
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
for months we did try to contact the

568
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,480
owners

569
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,679
um

570
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,440
that could just you know spray across

571
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,919
the internet constantly as it's a loud

572
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:20,960
horn

573
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,480
uh go on to the next slide please

574
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,240
i was gonna say these are some yeah so

575
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,600
another thing that we saw another big

576
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
spike in scanning and we also look at

577
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,280
these things globally and this is

578
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,679
combined both web traffic and some

579
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,280
non-web traffic

580
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,440
so we it was kind of funny the analyst

581
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,480
came to us and said hey there's this

582
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,960
huge spike of scans against singapore

583
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,720
coming from russia

584
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,919
and this week what's going you know

585
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,600
what's going on i said president trump

586
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,760
is in russia right now meeting with with

587
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,360
the president of north korea and i was

588
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,559
like oh

589
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,880
oh wow well these are all sip scans and

590
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,280
iot scans so you know are we looking at

591
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
some sort of interesting

592
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,559
espionage action it's like who knows and

593
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,400
who knows if it's actually russia i mean

594
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,080
you never know when you're looking at an

595
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,320
iap address uh go on to to the next

596
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,000
slide i was gonna say we started

597
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,360
following this data and next thing we

598
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,440
know we saw the same thing in finland

599
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,960
except for now the scans were coming

600
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,120
from china and he was meeting with

601
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,039
vladimir putin

602
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,640
so you know you just see some kind of

603
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,200
interesting weird stuff in the data

604
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,679
go on to the next one please

605
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,360
and lastly we were looking through the

606
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,760
data and just uh noticed there was a

607
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,640
coffee pot a coffee pot was hitting our

608
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,559
network just scanning away and you know

609
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,000
some of the people kind of went oh my

610
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,080
god it's a coffee pot bought you know

611
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,200
it's it's the end of the world i was

612
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,000
like oh maybe somebody just

613
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,840
misconfigured something or i don't know

614
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,679
it was beaconing but it was

615
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,520
uh if anybody's got any theories as to

616
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,280
what this was about i'd love to hear it

617
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,320
because it was it was pretty bizarre

618
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,000
um and we have not seen it since because

619
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,400
we're definitely been looking for it

620
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,360
go ahead to the next one malcolm

621
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,799
and take over please okay so if you want

622
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,880
to do something like you're like this

623
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
yourself um it's probably probable that

624
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,640
you can um

625
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,559
in my experience web blogs and wife logs

626
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,039
can be treasure troves if especially you

627
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,919
um

628
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,000
maybe do some pre-analysis and store

629
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,919
perhaps even just some counts of what

630
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:14,960
you see

631
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,799
for the long term and then continue that

632
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,080
over time you're going to get some

633
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,000
interesting trending data

634
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,360
you can use a similar approach to your

635
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,080
network edge uh you can sample um

636
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,919
it doesn't necessarily have to capture

637
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,200
absolutely everything because i know

638
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,039
that can be challenging especially with

639
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,640
uh the sort of

640
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,000
amount of data that we have flowing in

641
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,400
and out of our networks uh but even some

642
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,640
random sampling can can yield some

643
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,320
interesting results

644
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,000
uh and it's actually really interesting

645
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,679
to see what's hitting you even if it's

646
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,679
getting blocked uh or even if it you

647
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,480
know never reaches uh anything in your

648
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,760
infrastructure because it's stopped at

649
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,039
the firewall

650
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,559
um i think that that actually while you

651
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,080
don't want to spend obviously tons of

652
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,240
time analyzing it and tons of space

653
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,159
storing it

654
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,919
occasionally checking in on it or

655
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,320
gathering some summary data is actually

656
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,400
pretty useful to kind of figure out what

657
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,880
sorts of things attackers are trying

658
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,320
and when you see a shift in their

659
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,840
behavior it can give you a little bit of

660
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,919
a distant early warning like maybe

661
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,320
you're not using apis yet maybe your

662
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,440
company is not quite there yet um or is

663
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,120
you know trying to figure out if that

664
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,600
should be your strategy well maybe you

665
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,360
could

666
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,880
make the case that you need to invest in

667
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,640
some api security before you roll that

668
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,400
out given the fact that you might be

669
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,720
seeing a lot of api traffic getting

670
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,240
something uh even though you don't

671
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,720
actually have it

672
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,240
yet picture takeaways here um attacks

673
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,559
against api and author rising those are

674
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,000
the the two things that i would

675
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,080
recommend anybody really be looking at

676
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,799
are does your authentication endpoints

677
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,559
have adequate protections in terms of

678
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,000
protection against brute force

679
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,600
credential stuffing

680
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,080
obviously good passwords password reuse

681
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,039
all of the sorts of things um that you

682
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,159
need to do to protect your off

683
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,919
infrastructure and i know for a fact

684
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,760
that the oauth website has a huge amount

685
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,600
of data about many of these techniques

686
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,080
so i would refer you there

687
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,240
sql injection is falling off

688
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,480
certainly it's still an issue if you use

689
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,240
sql

690
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,000
to back your apps but

691
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,440
it does seem to be falling off but

692
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
command injection remains very popular

693
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,600
so basic app security stuff to protect

694
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,120
yourself against demand injection is

695
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,720
absolutely there

696
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,159
one interesting question that i had was

697
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,640
since the oauth top 10 combines sql

698
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,559
injection and command injection into one

699
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,799
category is the falloff and sql

700
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,320
injection

701
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,640
and a steady state in command injection

702
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,240
the reason why

703
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,640
injection has fallen a position or two

704
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,320
within the os top 10 that was just

705
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,400
recently released

706
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,480
i think it might be but i'd be

707
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,320
interested to hear if anybody has any

708
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,640
data on that

709
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,080
info disclosure

710
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,880
is

711
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,559
on the rise people are looking for

712
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,039
places where people store passwords or

713
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,120
leave authentication keys around whether

714
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,440
that's dot e b or dot git files or

715
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,880
anything like that so having some

716
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,120
hygiene around how you store things

717
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
is extremely important

718
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,640
uh and then public vulnerabilities of

719
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,559
course you know attackers pick these up

720
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,640
as quickly as they can which is often

721
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,039
very fast within a week or two

722
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,520
um and they use them heavily for about

723
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,840
three months um and then they don't go

724
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,799
away

725
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,600
they last for sometimes years

726
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,360
uh within the tool sets of the attackers

727
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,480
so with that we're done um thank you
