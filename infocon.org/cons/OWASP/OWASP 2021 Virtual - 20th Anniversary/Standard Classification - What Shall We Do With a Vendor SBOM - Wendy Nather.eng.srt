[Music]

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,840
thank you so much and i am honored to be

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,960
following the og jeff williams

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,160
um yes that this is what shall we do

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,279
with a vendor s-bomb and it is early in

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,640
the morning for some of you for me too

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
we'll try to get through this together

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,039
uh you are going to hear and you have

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,480
heard a lot about s-bombs already jeff

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,280
touched on them as well in his talk

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,160
and

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,200
um

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,440
there are so many smart people working

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,960
on the first line problems of s-bomb how

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,200
do we standardize how do we generate

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,440
them uh here at cisco we've been

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,079
generating s-bombs for internal use for

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,440
several years

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,079
and we're still working on issues there

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,280
um the distribution and everything

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,239
i'm going to take a step forward and say

22
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,840
let's pretend that we solved all these

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,879
problems

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,359
and you are a ciso and you've asked your

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,360
vendor for an s bomb and now you have it

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,040
in your hot little hands

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,159
and it is integrated into your you know

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,799
favorite dashboard now what are you

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,240
going to do with it

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,400
so that's the point at which i want to

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,200
start this talk

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,960
now you can sing along with me every

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
section goes with the song use it before

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,479
you buy this software

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,960
let's talk about

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,079
pre-procurement what are you going to do

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,600
with an s-bomb

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,920
in the pre-procurement phase

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,439
you're going to want to insert it in

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,439
several places but let's talk about this

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,479
first

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,320
now there are some things that don't

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,240
even necessarily have anything to do

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,759
with security

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,840
uh that you're going to be using s-bombs

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,720
for like avoiding licensing conflicts

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,040
like yeah we cannot use we can't

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,280
incorporate uh con

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,560
something with this particular licensing

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,799
into our own software that's an

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,240
immediate no

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,399
uh or you may have a bunch of business

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,880
units that you discover through

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,360
duplicate s-bombs that they are all

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,840
procuring software from the same vendor

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,120
and you might want to go back and

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,319
renegotiate that deal to save some money

58
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,879
so again these things don't necessarily

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,680
have anything to do with security but

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,440
they could be very useful from a

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,959
business perspective in your

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,959
organization

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,280
another thing is to check provenance

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,920
there may be some sources that you

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,160
absolutely will not take software from

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,840
and that's an immediate no as soon as

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,920
you see it before you sign the po you

68
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,319
say nope sorry we can't take this

69
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,920
that's also very straightforward

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,599
now if you start looking at

71
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,599
vulnerabilities associated with the

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,080
s-bomb this is where

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,239
you're going to start delaying things

74
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,519
you're going to start holding up the

75
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,920
procurement you're going to have some vp

76
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,239
saying look i just want this software

77
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,000
can we just get it first and then argue

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,440
about it later

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
so there's going to be negotiation

80
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,560
you're going to go back to the vendor

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,280
and say well you know there's this

82
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
associated with your s-bomb and they'll

83
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,239
say no that doesn't really apply because

84
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,440
blah

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,760
so it that's where things are going to

86
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,840
slow down in pre-procurement and so i

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,480
would urge you to be very careful about

88
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,360
what you want to

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
put here as a gate in the

90
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,840
pre-procurement process that has to do

91
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,959
with vulnerabilities maybe really big

92
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,040
you know show stopping ones

93
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,000
but if you cannot get all of your

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,959
management to agree that yes this is a

95
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,360
case for stopping the procurement

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,879
then you're just going to make yourself

97
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,239
miserable going forward so think really

98
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,720
carefully about this

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,239
now some people

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,239
wonder whether

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,360
you could use s-bombs instead of

102
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,879
today's favorite

103
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,760
pen tests or sdlc questionnaires

104
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,120
and my answer to this is no that pen

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,439
tests discover very different things

106
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,680
from what is going to be an ns bomb at

107
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
least you would hope so

108
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
and sdlc questionnaires are aimed in

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,920
general at gauging the maturity of the

110
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,959
vendor

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,160
and you're not going to find that with

112
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,478
an s bomb except that yes it might be a

113
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,880
sign of maturity if they can generate an

114
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,320
s bomb

115
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,120
uh

116
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,600
you might set that as a low baseline at

117
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080
some point that at the very minimum your

118
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,000
vendors all need to be able to generate

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,440
s-bombs if you're going to do business

120
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,800
with them

121
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,759
but

122
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,600
again i don't think s-bombs are going to

123
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,080
take the place of any of these that's

124
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,680
going to augment

125
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,199
the information gathering that you're

126
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,520
doing about your supply chain

127
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,560
not replace anything

128
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,199
so for pre-procurement i would encourage

129
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,800
you to focus on what you can

130
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,840
automatically stop or flag the the very

131
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,680
unambiguous parts of the s-bomb either

132
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,360
either it's there or it's not either it

133
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,440
says this or it doesn't

134
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,360
and then you know you can log the rest

135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,759
for notifications later

136
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,400
and uh don't forget to come join me in

137
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,720
the slack channel after this if you want

138
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,440
to argue with me because i love a good

139
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,000
knock down drag out slack so this will

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
be fun

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
next verse

142
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,840
use it for risk and bone disclosure

143
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,039
talk about vulnerability disclosure now

144
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,039
we already know a lot about

145
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,759
vulnerability management so what can we

146
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,000
learn from it to apply to s-bombs

147
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
first of all someone else's criticality

148
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,960
rating isn't always going to be yours we

149
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,720
know this

150
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,240
and

151
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,919
uh in fact if you are using different

152
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,400
different methods of prioritizing your

153
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,039
vulnerabilities for remediation i urge

154
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,000
you to look at a report series from

155
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,120
scientia institute and canada security

156
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,520
and full disclosure kenna was acquired

157
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,960
by cisco earlier this year

158
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,919
they have a great series called

159
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,199
prioritization to prediction

160
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,600
and in the first report

161
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,720
they

162
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
revealed what i thought was some very

163
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,280
interesting data in research that

164
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
if you compare all the different methods

165
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
that you might use to prioritize

166
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,000
patching

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,240
if you use any one of them

168
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,319
whether it's criticality or exploit

169
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,080
available or blast radius or whatever

170
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
that method is likely no better than

171
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,360
patching randomly and i thought that was

172
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,400
just mind-blowing now they did find that

173
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,800
if you use all the methods and combine

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,160
them

175
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,120
you might get a better result in in

176
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,560
terms of coverage and accuracy on your

177
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,840
patching

178
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,120
but

179
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,880
this is something that you need to be

180
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,160
good at

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,400
uh before you start using s-bombs to

182
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,680
decide uh because prioritization is

183
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,720
still going to be a thing

184
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,560
you're going to have to annotate what's

185
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,960
really definitely affected

186
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,400
and what isn't

187
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,240
so you might look at an s bomb and a

188
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,880
vulnerability associated with it and say

189
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,240
yes that's the real vulnerability but

190
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,960
it's only you know

191
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,479
it only affects these functions and

192
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,639
we're not calling those functions

193
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,120
so you're going to want to annotate that

194
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,759
somewhere and say yes you know

195
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,440
not affected

196
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,800
because we don't call those functions

197
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,039
wendy signed off on it on this date

198
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,160
you're going to need to show it to

199
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,680
auditors you know you're going to have

200
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,919
to pull it up you might want to flag

201
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,800
that

202
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,639
later if you change the code and you end

203
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,720
up calling those functions then you

204
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,639
definitely are affected

205
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,960
so all of those things and again this is

206
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,520
not new we we have this issue today but

207
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,240
just be prepared to do even more of it

208
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,199
you got to annotate what the disposition

209
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,479
is of the s-bomb

210
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,039
do we patch or do they patch

211
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,599
and again here's another issue that we

212
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,680
have to try to figure out it's going to

213
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,919
be more with s-bombs

214
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,840
depending on whether it's open source do

215
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,960
we find somebody else does the vendor

216
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,759
disclaim all responsibility if you patch

217
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,479
it

218
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,560
what is the timeline does it require

219
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,960
recertification

220
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,919
all of those things

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,919
and so if even if you have good

222
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,240
remediation and update processes right

223
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,759
now to estimate how much it's going to

224
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,599
cost and how long it's going to take to

225
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,200
remediate something

226
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
you're going to need even more of them

227
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,760
when you start getting s-bombs in the

228
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,880
door

229
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,279
so you can't just bring in s-bombs and

230
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,600
let them sit and not decide what to do

231
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,560
with them

232
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,319
that's going to be a big problem

233
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
also we can learn things from threat

234
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,519
intelligence when we're looking at using

235
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,000
s-bombs and consuming them

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,080
here's a good lesson do you even trust

237
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,440
the s-bomb

238
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,760
i can certainly see in the future where

239
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,480
organizations are going to say yes we

240
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,640
trust the s-bombs from these vendors but

241
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,920
this vendor

242
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,320
uh yeah it's always it's always really

243
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,680
dodgy they don't really know what

244
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,279
they're doing they just kind of wave

245
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,200
their hands and and spat out something

246
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,640
that looks like an s-bomb but we don't

247
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,480
trust it

248
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,320
um the same thing with threat

249
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,200
intelligence today with iocs that have

250
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,880
been sanitized and they don't tell you

251
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,360
enough the s-bomb is going to be as

252
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,000
brief as it can possibly get away with

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,279
being and so if you have questions about

254
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,680
technical details yeah we see this in

255
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
the s bomb and we got questions who are

256
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,279
you going to ask

257
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,080
about it make sure you understand

258
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,000
how to do that

259
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
another thing i want to point out is

260
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,080
that there are plenty of organizations

261
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,640
out there today who insist on getting

262
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,399
the source code from their vendors and

263
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,640
scanning it themselves

264
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,560
and if you can get the source code

265
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,920
that's great

266
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,680
you can imagine that a vendor might say

267
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,360
well now we have an s bomb can we just

268
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,279
give you the s-bomb

269
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,880
and i expect that those who prefer to do

270
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,720
their own scanning are going to say no

271
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,640
that's not good enough

272
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,360
we need the source code still

273
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,519
if you're going to do your own scanning

274
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,320
please be very careful what tools you

275
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,640
use if you're going to use binary

276
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,399
scanners if you don't have the source

277
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,760
code

278
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
according to our own data inside of

279
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,240
cisco checking our binary scanning tools

280
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,560
against our source code

281
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,040
we found that the binary tools are only

282
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,600
about 60 percent accurate in what they

283
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,480
find

284
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,800
and i have heard other people ranting

285
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,760
and raving that actually the tools are

286
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,040
closer to producing like 99 false

287
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,160
positives sorry for for you know binary

288
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
scanning tool vendors out there but

289
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,399
anyway from our own data from the tools

290
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,000
that we use about 60 accuracy yeah not

291
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,279
great

292
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,519
so if you're scanning your

293
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,040
the um

294
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,800
if you're scanning binaries on your own

295
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,160
and you're going back to the vendor and

296
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,480
saying you know i'm seeing this

297
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,959
and uh you know i don't you should have

298
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,880
listed this in your s-bomb

299
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,040
this is the same problem that we have

300
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,160
today

301
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,000
when people are reporting

302
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,399
vulnerabilities through a bug bounty

303
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,600
program or anything else there are some

304
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,839
researchers who bring in great bugs and

305
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,240
we go yes we absolutely agree good find

306
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,800
have a t-shirt or whatever

307
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,560
but then there are others that will

308
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,279
bring in uh you know some assertion and

309
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,880
we'll have to go you know i think you

310
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
really misinterpreted this

311
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,560
or you didn't use the tool right this

312
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
isn't really a thing and that

313
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,560
negotiation is going to take a long time

314
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,200
it's very annoying for both sides so

315
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,480
please

316
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,120
don't do this unless you're sure you can

317
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,839
really find

318
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,560
worthy

319
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,519
issues to take up with the source of the

320
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,839
software that you've gotten

321
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,600
because otherwise there's going to be a

322
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
lot of confusion around the use of these

323
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,680
s-bombs and we'd like to try to avoid

324
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,639
that

325
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,399
now remember to everybody blocking is

326
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,560
breaking

327
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,720
now there are many

328
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,560
organizations out there that will say

329
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,079
well we're just going to automate

330
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,839
because there's so much data that's

331
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,000
going to come in with these s bombs

332
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,639
and and we're going to automate you know

333
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,480
matching up the vulnerabilities and

334
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,160
we're going to match up all the exploits

335
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,680
with threat intelligence and then we're

336
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,279
going to automatically block anything

337
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,480
that we see

338
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,279
no you're not and um even if you were

339
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,360
perfect at

340
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,320
detecting active exploits

341
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,079
in the data stream and blocking them

342
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,720
your organization your customer is not

343
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,959
going to trust you to do it

344
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,160
which is why i remember 10 years ago

345
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,399
i think the figure was that only about

346
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,800
10 percent of wafs out there actually

347
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,680
had any blocking rules enabled i don't

348
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,320
know what the figure is now

349
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,680
somebody can tell me in the slack

350
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,760
channel but i'm guessing it's not much

351
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,160
bigger than that because the truth is

352
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,720
that a lot of customers don't

353
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
know enough about

354
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,240
their software especially legacy

355
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,079
software to know

356
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,480
whether it's going to be safe to try to

357
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,760
block something i did hear about an

358
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,240
application that purposely used sql

359
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,959
injection to update the database

360
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,560
purposely

361
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,399
and i'm sure the developer was very

362
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,079
proud of themselves for having come up

363
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,000
with this really neat trick

364
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,519
so you can't just block things and so

365
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,519
don't assume that when you have an s

366
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,880
bomb it's gonna

367
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,279
you know automatically add more rules

368
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,839
for things

369
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,920
which leads us to the question of who's

370
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,760
going to need this information and who

371
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,720
simply needs an fyi on these s-bombs

372
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
think about who in your organization is

373
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,800
going to need to see them and who just

374
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,279
needs to know that they're there or who

375
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,160
just wants to look at them you know

376
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,880
every six months or whatever there are

377
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
going to be some people

378
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,120
in your team who are going to want to

379
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,000
look at them in depth trace them uh

380
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,279
validate them and all sorts of things

381
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,880
and there are people who are just going

382
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,279
to dabble like they may want to do

383
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,120
random sampling and go to a vendor do

384
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
you do you have the s-bomb for this yeah

385
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,360
okay i was just checking

386
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
think about that

387
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,680
and what is the risk and the impact of

388
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,720
partial remediation let's say we have

389
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,839
this

390
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,199
particular component in 27 locations

391
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,760
and we can remediate one of them right

392
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
now but the others are going to take six

393
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,399
months because of reasons

394
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,639
again how are you going to track that

395
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,480
how are you going to

396
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,320
make sure that you follow up on things

397
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,680
how are you going to explain the

398
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,040
timeline

399
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,560
and how are you going to estimate the

400
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,519
risk

401
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,639
of that remediation

402
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,880
is anybody getting depressed yet

403
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,440
sorry

404
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,680
and then finally everybody who talks

405
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,000
about us bombs almost without exception

406
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,240
gets really excited about the idea of oh

407
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,839
we're going to make social graphs and

408
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,079
we're going to find out where

409
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,160
components are widespread and where they

410
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,240
came from and trace them all the way

411
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,160
back and we're going to do social graphs

412
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
and it's going to be so cool

413
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,720
and i agree they're really cool but what

414
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,279
are you really going to do with them

415
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,680
let's say that we build

416
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,160
amazing research and social graphs and

417
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,000
we discover that some vulnerable

418
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,040
component has now infiltrated half of

419
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,079
the known

420
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,519
civilized world

421
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,759
that's going to make a great owasp talk

422
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,680
and it's going to make a great black hat

423
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,480
talk

424
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,639
but what is your customer really going

425
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,920
to do about it

426
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,279
what what are they going to do with that

427
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,880
info are they going to throw you know

428
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,959
that component out is that going to be

429
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,399
any different

430
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,240
from how they would have

431
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,480
disposed of it you know not knowing

432
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,279
about the social graph as my colleague

433
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,440
helen patton points out

434
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,519
there is no terminal point at the end of

435
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,399
a

436
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,839
supply chain

437
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,160
there's no one end where you say okay

438
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,560
now we've stopped and we've traced it

439
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,839
all the way back

440
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,079
so be careful when you start graphing

441
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,560
things because you may be adding

442
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,480
visibility

443
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
visibility i'm going to go out on a limb

444
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,160
here visibility isn't always good yeah

445
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,720
it's it's not always good sometimes it

446
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,680
just confuses the issue more so be

447
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,560
careful and think about what visibility

448
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,519
you need

449
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,120
because you're going to do something

450
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,000
with it

451
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,199
now the final verse good look like using

452
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,160
it for

453
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,560
forensics

454
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,360
yeah forensics

455
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,240
know the limits of this s-bomb you know

456
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,839
when you're when you're going to start

457
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,280
using it

458
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,039
let's say that you

459
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,520
hear about a vulnerability six months

460
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,119
down the line

461
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,400
and

462
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,959
it was in a version of software that

463
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,559
might have been in place but you have to

464
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,959
figure out whether it was do you really

465
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,240
have logs

466
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
on every component

467
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,919
and how long it was installed in which

468
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,840
locations from what date to what date

469
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,080
again i'd love to hear about it in slack

470
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,919
if you really can produce those from six

471
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,000
months away

472
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,480
i'm guessing the answer is no for most

473
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,840
people

474
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,960
so

475
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,480
yeah this is going to be tough and

476
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,679
furthermore

477
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,160
do you know enough about how each

478
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,640
component is used to know whether it was

479
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,400
really exploited

480
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,679
again

481
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,640
from my work in organizations there's a

482
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,280
lot of software that they don't know

483
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
very much about anymore

484
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,120
either it's legacy and it hasn't been

485
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,880
touched in 10 years

486
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,000
or

487
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,320
it belongs to another vendor

488
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,760
they're not allowed to look inside it

489
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
it's not theirs

490
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
they inherited it with from an

491
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,880
acquisition

492
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,679
and all the people they acquired left

493
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,640
there are so many reasons why

494
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
just getting an s bomb and getting

495
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,720
information will make you have to go

496
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,280
look at the innards of an application

497
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,880
for the first time and go spelunking

498
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,760
and

499
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,559
i

500
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,320
am guessing that you don't have people

501
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,760
sitting around waiting for these

502
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,919
spelunking assignments

503
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,440
so you're going to have to figure out

504
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,919
resourcing how important is it

505
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,240
for us to get to the bottom of this and

506
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,919
really track it down

507
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,240
and really either prove a positive or a

508
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,320
negative

509
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
so um

510
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,480
think about this

511
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,679
when we think about consumers of s-bombs

512
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,720
we and and a lot of application security

513
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,440
we tend to use as example the the top

514
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,080
one percent of security organizations

515
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,880
like

516
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,160
um you know financial services

517
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,799
and that we think of them as the end

518
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,559
consumers of everything like they sit

519
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,160
there and they

520
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,559
you know consume everything but what's

521
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,880
really going to be more important

522
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,559
are the people in the middle of the

523
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,320
supply chain if you are receiving and

524
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,280
you are sharing and you are distributing

525
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,840
uh you're incorporating and you're

526
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,679
passing things on

527
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,320
as an entity in the middle of a supply

528
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,559
chain you're going to have to know what

529
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,840
you want and what you're going to say to

530
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,640
other entities downstream about these

531
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,679
things

532
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,679
so you're going to have to decide to the

533
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,080
depth at which you can investigate

534
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,840
something because you're going to owe

535
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,880
answers

536
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,200
to your your recipients to your

537
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,880
downstream customers and to your

538
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,120
partners

539
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,000
so

540
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,480
the downside to this is that

541
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,880
if you have incomplete data

542
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
and you can't find the answer you can't

543
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,480
prove a negative

544
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,559
it usually means that you you know to be

545
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,240
on the safe side you have to do a breach

546
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,760
notification

547
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,799
so suddenly you're in the position where

548
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,000
your

549
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
legal people are saying well we have

550
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,400
this concern because there was this

551
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,760
vulnerability announced with this

552
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,480
associated with this s-bomb we know that

553
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,120
we had this at some point

554
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,039
in our systems but you're saying that's

555
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,720
all the information we can get on it we

556
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,960
cannot say for sure that we weren't

557
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,799
affected

558
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,440
and they're going to hate that because

559
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,000
everybody hates incomplete information

560
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,240
you get just enough information to give

561
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,480
you more reasons to worry and then you

562
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,360
can't assuage that worry

563
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,039
this is something you're gonna have to

564
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,360
talk with your with your management team

565
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
about what are we going to do if we

566
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,120
can't answer it

567
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,960
because i predict there will be a lot of

568
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,960
that

569
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,679
uh what about sass

570
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,520
what if you are using a sas provider do

571
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,120
you go to them and say we want your

572
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,360
s-bombs and your s-bombs of your s-bombs

573
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,760
and your s-bombs of your s-bombs and

574
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,440
they will probably go

575
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,880
uh no no we are not doing that

576
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,240
so

577
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,679
is it going to be s bombs all the way

578
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,080
down at what point are you going to be

579
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,559
satisfied as a consumer

580
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,679
with

581
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,240
uh the number of s-bombs that you get

582
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,280
and again

583
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,440
this is all the limits of the s-bombs

584
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,039
and the limits of the knowledge that

585
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,000
you'll be able to get from them

586
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,840
so think about those as well

587
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,120
here are a few more thoughts about

588
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,760
s-bombs and that is that

589
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,000
i think when we all start using them and

590
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,760
and i'm sure we will

591
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,159
uh it's going to prompt a big initial

592
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,799
flood of data that will cost time and

593
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,400
effort to sort through and to make

594
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,520
decisions about and that's as if we

595
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,880
didn't already have enough or too much

596
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,679
data that we are trying to wade through

597
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,919
most organizations have more threat

598
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,240
intel coming in than they can deal with

599
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,400
and they have more log data

600
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,159
and alerts coming in than they can deal

601
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,120
with

602
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
so s bombs are just going to make that

603
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,480
worse because we are going to get

604
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,799
visibility which will be great but it

605
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,840
will be at a next level down

606
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,640
a granular level that we may not be

607
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,520
prepared to look at

608
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,039
and uh once again decide who in your

609
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,240
resource

610
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,360
pool

611
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,559
is going to have the time and ability to

612
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,960
to trace these down who is going to be

613
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,320
consuming them

614
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,600
uh not just how is it going into your

615
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,200
infrastructure

616
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,640
because again i'm going to warn you

617
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,919
you're not going to be able to automate

618
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,559
all of it you may not even be able to

619
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,400
automate any of it especially at the

620
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,320
beginning you're going to have to

621
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,559
annotate the disposition and the

622
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,960
analysis of those s bombs and you're

623
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,840
going to be

624
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,000
have to answer questions based on them

625
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,679
especially if you're in the middle of a

626
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,000
supply chain

627
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,799
so

628
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,640
it's going to prompt a big initial flood

629
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,280
of data think carefully about this

630
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,159
i really want to hear what

631
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,919
what the public sector is thinking about

632
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:18,640
this

633
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,760
in light of the executive order

634
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,840
now if you don't already have a

635
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,919
vulnerability management process working

636
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,240
for what you learn about today

637
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,640
please don't add s-bombs to the mix

638
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
again i think it's just going to make

639
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,799
your situation worse

640
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,919
and i'm willing to to fight about that

641
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,919
but and here's an idea

642
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,159
that my colleagues and i had

643
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,320
if you are a small business and you've

644
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,720
never been able to assess the

645
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,000
vulnerability of your infrastructure

646
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,440
before

647
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,120
s bombs might be a good place to start

648
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,720
with you know the assistance of a

649
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,039
consultant or mssp or something like

650
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,200
that if you don't have the expertise to

651
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,679
analyze it yourself but just to collect

652
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,720
s-bombs from your vendors

653
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
and again you're probably going to be

654
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,880
more reliant on those vendors than

655
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,960
larger organizations are

656
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,440
but you just kind of want to know

657
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,919
what it is that you're using and what it

658
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,679
is that you're dealing with it's a good

659
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,880
exercise

660
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,640
to go through and see

661
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,000
not only

662
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
what is in the s-bomb that you get from

663
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
your vendor but what's your relationship

664
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,760
with your vendor

665
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
it's even more important to test that

666
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,039
part if they hedge and say well

667
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,640
you won't understand the s-bomb so we're

668
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,559
not going to give it to you or

669
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,960
oh sure here it is no we're not going to

670
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,640
explain it to you

671
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,960
then you may want to reconsider your

672
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,039
relationship with that vendor

673
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,159
this is going to be a new level of

674
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,640
relationship between customers and

675
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,880
providers where they have to figure out

676
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
how to have these dialogues and these

677
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,679
negotiations around s-bombs

678
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,320
so these are my predictions

679
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,640
for when we start using them whenever

680
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,120
that is

681
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,279
and then finally i'm going to share some

682
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,320
resources and i'm going to ask martin to

683
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,960
do me a favor and copy and paste these

684
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,080
into the 20th anniversary oh wasp

685
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,000
standard classification

686
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,679
classification

687
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,960
slack channel

688
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,320
so that you can click on them and look

689
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,600
at them yourself

690
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,120
if as

691
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,600
uh if as a

692
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,039
um

693
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,279
as a consumer you decide you want to use

694
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,880
s-bombs and you want to ask for them in

695
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,840
a vendor contract the ntia has a really

696
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,360
good paper on how to do this so i i

697
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,440
recommend that here's the kenneth

698
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,960
prioritization to prediction link it's a

699
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,039
i think it's a group of seven papers but

700
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,200
the statistic that i was quoting was

701
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,360
from the very first one

702
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,840
and also if you want to hear about how

703
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,320
they're discussing labeling programs for

704
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,520
consumers

705
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,600
here's a nice link to one of the the

706
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
workshop sessions

707
