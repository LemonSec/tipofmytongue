2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,960
thanks daniel hello everyone i'm excited

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,120
about today's session and even more

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,120
excited that each of you are here with

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,160
me our world is rapidly evolving and

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,560
that has a direct impact on how we do

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,960
everything especially how we conduct

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,519
business every aspect of our lives has

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,160
an increased reliance on technology and

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
more so than ever before so when i was

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,238
growing up the most advanced

12
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,399
technological thing i did was set the

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,880
clock on the car radio or set up the vcr

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,280
to record my mother's soap operas which

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,920
all the adults found so impressive and

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,040
here we are

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,280
in 2021 and my ten-year-old niece

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,440
michaela has no idea what a vcer is

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
and that's what we see in spaces as

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,600
large as each industry and as intimate

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,160
as the microcosms of our own departments

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,640
and project teams the opportunities for

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,480
today cannot be solved with the

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,520
expertise of yesteryears sure there's

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,519
tried and true wisdom that we should

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,840
carry forward but we cannot ignore the

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
myriad of changes that require a shift

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,040
in how we achieve both business and

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,439
cyber security goals so with the

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,560
released

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
increased reliance on tech naturally

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,280
comes increased regulation and with

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,600
increased regulation comes more visits

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,400
from the auditors more questions from

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,880
the cyber security folks and tech

36
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,040
leaders and more checklists from our

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
compliance officers and rightfully so as

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,640
the businesses that we run house and

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,799
protect the sensitive information of our

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,079
customers trade secrets and corporate

41
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,799
strategies but my career path has proven

42
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,320
that there is a new way to work with our

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,040
cyber security partners one that drives

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
business forward while creating a space

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,439
for innovation and that is what we'll

46
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,439
talk about today but before we get

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,040
started let's set some ground rules and

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,520
i only have one because of the state of

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,280
our world we're now forced to facilitate

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,600
exchanges like these through virtual

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
platforms and that means for people like

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
me who are accustomed to speaking to

53
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,758
audiences and persons i can't see you

54
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,560
not in your head or rolling your eyes so

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,959
if you have questions or commentary i

56
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,640
really ask that you all engage with me

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,959
in the slack channel after today's

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,440
presentation all right let's get started

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,120
with the problem statement

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,879
have you ever done

61
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,599
a lot of work for a little bit of money

62
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,760
or did what seemed to be a lot of

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
exercise only to see a tiny bit of

64
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,120
results

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
i certainly have and i can tell you that

66
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,239
it is not any fun okay let's start with

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,480
some honesty when it comes to cyber

68
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,040
security audit compliance many of the

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,360
business leaders i've engaged with feel

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,680
like the products they work on have too

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,160
much effort and two little roi okay and

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,680
it's not to say that the work these

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,760
teams do are not important

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,599
it's just that a lot of the times they

75
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,760
may or may not focus on the immediate

76
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,480
goals at hand nor do they address the

77
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,879
pressing matters of this day this

78
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
quarter and sometimes this calendar year

79
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,120
and that makes the work sometimes feel

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,760
inconvenient and challenging

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,840
that doesn't feel good because even the

82
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,120
right things at the wrong time are the

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,239
wrong things so i started my career

84
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,920
working for wall street investment bank

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
goldman sachs i moved into risk

86
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,200
management consulting with price

87
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
warehouse coopers after a few years

88
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
there i worked in rockstar games in new

89
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,360
york city even got to do voice over work

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,239
on some video game titles after that i

91
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,000
spent some time living and working

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,239
abroad in romania and then moved into

93
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,640
cyber security where i am now a business

94
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,720
information security officer for warner

95
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
media

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,840
and what i've learned throughout my

97
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,040
career by observing my peers leaders as

98
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,200
business partners clients is that us

99
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
gross management folks do a really good

100
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,000
job of telling people no

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,159
and the word no is an impediment to

102
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,239
progress growth creativity innovation

103
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,640
i learned that the hard way but cyber

104
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,040
security is a necessary integral part of

105
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,920
the corporate ecosystem but after being

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,959
shoot away by leaders having my meetings

107
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,760
postponed getting pushback on consulting

108
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,680
engagement reports being ignored in the

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
hallways and cafeterias it was pretty

110
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,639
obvious that if we continue to operate

111
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,600
as we did our entire function and

112
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,320
selfishly my career would be an uphill

113
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,520
battle

114
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
we do a really good job of

115
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,440
building and maintaining roadblocks but

116
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,600
if we were to simply shift

117
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,320
how we delivered no's coupling them

118
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,479
with alternative solutions that enabled

119
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,280
the same goal we would unlock something

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,919
really unique and special and ultimately

121
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,160
valuable and that should be the goal of

122
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,479
anyone who calls himself a business

123
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,160
partner driving value so today's session

124
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
will outline my journey from speaking

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,639
the language of no to excelling in the

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,479
business of yes which is the secret

127
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,199
sauce behind a host of accomplishments

128
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,960
including identifying over a million

129
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,199
dollars no one knew was missing turn to

130
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,639
500 percent roi and pilot and reducing

131
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,199
cyber security incidents by 70

132
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,759
year over year all right

133
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,000
so let's get started

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,919
okay nobody likes the auditors let's

135
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,160
just be for real right i mean who in

136
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,960
their right mind wants to be audited

137
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,400
whether it's your own internal audit

138
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
department or the irs

139
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,759
knowing that you're about to be under

140
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,240
the gun just doesn't feel good no matter

141
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,479
how you slice it and if you take a step

142
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,400
back and think about the way audit teams

143
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,520
operate

144
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,400
it's pretty intrusive and i can say this

145
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,240
because i am a certified internal

146
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
auditor when i was in public accounting

147
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,240
we'd set a date we come to the client's

148
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,560
office find a space to hunker down which

149
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,240
means we took over a conference room or

150
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,479
two then we'd meet our clients develop a

151
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,880
long list of questions interview them

152
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
then make another long list of document

153
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,120
requests and then ask for proof that

154
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,440
what they gave us was accurate

155
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,120
and after all of that which likely went

156
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,039
on for a week or two we would create

157
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
another list of what could go wrong what

158
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,520
went wrong and then ask them what are

159
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,440
you going to do to fix it

160
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,520
and then finally create a report of

161
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,360
everything we found wrong and share it

162
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
with them their boss their bosses boss

163
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,560
all the way up to not only the ceo but

164
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,199
the audit committee nothing about that

165
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,919
feels good now don't misunderstand me

166
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,680
there is some value that comes with

167
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
these types of projects again one of my

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,080
proudest accomplishments as an auditor

169
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
was identifying 1.2 million dollars in

170
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,039
revenue leakage but to have to tell on

171
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,360
the people who are responsible

172
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,600
not cool so it's easy for me to

173
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,400
understand why nobody likes the auditors

174
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,919
because they typically don't bring or

175
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,919
deliver good news and it seems that the

176
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,560
entire shop is focused on

177
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,400
looking to the past instead of where the

178
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,160
company is going to land in the future

179
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,400
now after a while

180
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,080
i got tired of being the bearer of bad

181
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,639
news right i don't expect business to be

182
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,800
all sunshine and rainbows but i was also

183
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,280
wise enough to understand that the risk

184
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,199
management in cyber security could not

185
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,680
and should not exist in a vacuum of

186
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,560
negative reports about the past so i

187
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,240
shift how i operated and the first thing

188
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,479
i did was i went on a listening tour

189
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,000
instead of diving right in and asking

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
for a long list of reports and proof i

191
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,479
just listened i asked questions about

192
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,240
the people i met with their teams their

193
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,560
goals their challenges shifting the way

194
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,319
i saw the business shifted the way i

195
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,080
worked with the business and resulted in

196
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,319
the three-pronged strategy strategy that

197
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,240
you see on the screen

198
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,319
establishing alignment increasing

199
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,199
accountability and driving awareness by

200
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,880
aligning my work with the goals of the

201
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,120
team it became relevant

202
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,879
being a part of their success strategy

203
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,120
made me accountable and driving

204
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,199
awareness of not only what went wrong

205
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,080
but promoting what they did right built

206
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,560
trust okay this is not just a strategy

207
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,479
for auditors cyber security or

208
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,479
compliance professionals

209
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,479
this strategy can be used by any shared

210
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,639
service professional or business person

211
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,199
seeking to drive impact and success

212
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,160
alongside cross-functional disciplines

213
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,720
which is a common challenge that's faced

214
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
by many

215
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,919
now the best place to start is by

216
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,000
finding the best place to start it's a

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,639
process and the foundational elements of

218
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,759
this process are understanding two very

219
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,639
important things first the businesses

220
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,120
goals what is your business looking to

221
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,320
achieve over the past 17 years i found

222
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,919
that most of the leaders i engage with

223
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,320
are looking to impact client experience

224
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,799
client retention and strong financial

225
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,159
performance the first of amazon's 14

226
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,320
leadership principles is customer

227
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,360
obsession right it reads leaders start

228
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,920
with the customer and work backwards

229
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,399
they work vigorously to earn and keep

230
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,880
customer trust although leaders pay

231
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,080
attention to competitors they obsess

232
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,880
over customers and in all my years i've

233
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,959
met a few cyber security professionals

234
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,800
that were obsessed over their clients

235
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,640
and what i found is that those were the

236
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,399
professionals that found success in

237
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,720
their roles they were able to articulate

238
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
the way operations work they understood

239
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
how to navigate the culture they knew

240
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,160
what the business was working for and

241
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,200
could align with those priorities

242
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,399
and essentially work effectively and

243
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,560
appropriately which makes brings me to

244
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
the second item that needs to be

245
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,800
understood your information security

246
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,880
strategy your risk management strategy

247
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,480
your tech strategy your compliance

248
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,680
strategy

249
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,040
once you know what you're looking to

250
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,279
achieve you can then find the sweet spot

251
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,600
where the two overlap ensuring that the

252
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,560
work you do is relevant not only to you

253
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,080
but to your business partners your

254
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,160
clients your executive leaders and by

255
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,320
doing this you create a what's in it for

256
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,480
me and that sets the tone for value

257
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,680
creation as a basis for relevant impact

258
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,839
if you can convince your collaborator

259
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,360
that the work you're doing is going to

260
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,200
help them achieve their goals i can

261
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,279
nearly guarantee you that they will be

262
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,600
much more open to work with you and that

263
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
is the point

264
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,560
the sweet spot where you're tran where

265
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,519
you transition from performing a task to

266
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,680
offering a service and enabling success

267
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,079
now what most love and some hate about

268
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,079
the concept of accountability is that it

269
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,040
requires action so it's no surprise that

270
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,680
the first word you see on the screen

271
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,720
is operationalize okay it's the first

272
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,160
prong of the strategy we talk about

273
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
alignment of strategy goals purpose

274
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,279
agenda

275
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,959
once you've established that what you're

276
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,120
working for then you actually have to do

277
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,279
some work so as you build the path to

278
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,440
achieving your goal you will essentially

279
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,079
be building your execution strategy and

280
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,160
this is a key area where the rubber

281
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,320
meets the road but it can't be done

282
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,920
without the first piece of strategy

283
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,399
alignment lock down only when there is

284
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,000
sync between the what the business is

285
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,399
working for and what the infosec teams

286
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,040
are looking to achieve can this be

287
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,680
unlocked now the key here is leveraging

288
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,120
the strengths of your cyber security

289
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,680
partners to your advantage okay risk

290
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,440
management folks are specialists in

291
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,760
saying what can go wrong the reason why

292
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,440
that is painful is that y'all they

293
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
always test for what has gone wrong

294
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
retroactively

295
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,040
instead equip them to identify what

296
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,760
could go wrong as you look ahead this is

297
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
a key strategy i've used to engage my

298
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,440
business leaders as their business

299
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,839
information security officer

300
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,320
of course i do review incident metrics

301
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,480
to understand what happened where we can

302
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
work on reducing security incidents but

303
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
instead of beating the business over the

304
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,800
head with that data i leveraged that

305
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
perspective against their slate of new

306
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,240
product developments and strategic

307
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,040
initiatives to identify pockets of

308
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,920
opportunity all right my role as a viso

309
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,760
is to advocate for the business across

310
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,640
the security organization and advocate

311
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,720
prudent risk-taking within the business

312
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,120
and if positioned correctly i am the

313
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,600
organization's secret information

314
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,760
security weapon so for example a

315
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
business unit at one of my old companies

316
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,120
was in the process of creating a

317
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,959
completely digital enrollment process

318
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,040
for a product and when i sat in on the

319
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
planning sessions i learned that the

320
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,720
registration for the product and its

321
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,320
service required capturing and

322
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,839
validating of sensitive private

323
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,079
information but when i went back to do

324
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,760
some research on that business looking

325
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,680
at their incidents i realized that this

326
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480
product and service were ripe for fraud

327
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,320
and instead of simply delivering that

328
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,399
information to the business unit i

329
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,639
didn't only approach them with problems

330
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,360
but with solutions and not just one but

331
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,160
multiple crafting solutions that were

332
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,680
relevant required that i do some

333
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,600
background research understand the

334
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
client and their experience figure out

335
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,279
what the challenges were and figure out

336
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,760
a way to solve them before they started

337
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,360
and that is what we have to challenge

338
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,079
our cyber security folks to do we have

339
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,639
to be solution oriented if we want to

340
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,800
sit at the table we have to carry our

341
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,440
weight okay and use our ability to find

342
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,600
what can go wrong to the business's

343
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,079
advantage instead of relying on being

344
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,360
detective

345
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,399
leverage our expertise to be preventive

346
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,600
okay in my current role i sit in the slt

347
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
meetings of all of my business partners

348
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
and their executive leaders i'm the only

349
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
one there that's not on their direct

350
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,880
reports roster why not only because i

351
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,720
asked but because during my listening

352
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
tour

353
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,760
i shared with them that the purpose of

354
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,920
my role is to find out ways to

355
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,480
facilitate their goals from the lens of

356
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,880
information security instead of telling

357
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,720
them what they cannot do my

358
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,480
responsibility is to figure out what

359
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,320
they can do without being disruptive

360
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,760
this means that i coordinate with

361
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,320
insights incident management privacy

362
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
legal architecture third party and a

363
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,639
host of other teams to manage the

364
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,880
infosec work stream across their

365
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
initiatives and because i deliver

366
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,199
results they pull me in early and

367
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,120
because they pull me in early i'm able

368
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,600
to check off all the infosec boxes ahead

369
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,160
of time so that they can be

370
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,000
pushed forward and be great

371
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
now

372
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,079
one of my best friends for many years is

373
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,760
a guy we'll call john

374
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,720
and john and i have known each other for

375
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,519
over 15 years and he recently moved into

376
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,720
sales and he's doing a fantastic job and

377
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,240
the more i think about the way john

378
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,680
operates as a person i can see why

379
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,199
he's great at keeping in touch which is

380
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,639
probably why our friendship has lasted

381
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,600
this long um he he reaches out he calls

382
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,639
he stays in contact and then when he

383
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,639
calls he has no issue in telling me

384
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,480
everything that's going on with him he

385
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,040
shares his story of wins challenges

386
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,120
triumphs in a way that's exciting and

387
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,680
engaging and relatable so much so by the

388
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,600
time he gets finished i feel compared to

389
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,360
share my story too

390
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,160
and what john style has done for me is

391
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,480
is highlight a couple key things the

392
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
necessity of establishing connection and

393
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,760
the importance of sharing your story

394
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
many times we make the mistake of

395
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,440
thinking that just doing a good job and

396
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,199
keeping our heads down is enough

397
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,120
somebody will notice but that is the

398
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,360
furthest thing from the truth on my

399
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,600
podcast urban girl corporate world i

400
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,760
interview one of my former leaders kim

401
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,320
albarella about being a woman working in

402
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,399
the cyber security industry

403
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,079
interestingly enough both she and i

404
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,760
started our careers on wall street

405
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,160
worked in finance and now we're in tech

406
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
i was the only woman on my last team

407
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,839
before coming to my current company and

408
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,519
having worked with all men for a few

409
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,279
years i picked up some of their habits

410
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,199
which we dive into on that podcast

411
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,839
episode and one of which is strategic

412
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,720
storytelling how do you position

413
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,680
experiences and tasks to weave together

414
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,880
a talk track for a broader purpose each

415
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
and everything that we do

416
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
has impact whether we acknowledge it or

417
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,360
not but when we take the time to think

418
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,759
things through especially before we act

419
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,360
we are equipping ourselves with the

420
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,000
power that can shift odds of all kinds

421
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,720
in our favor when i gave my bit my a bit

422
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,639
of my background earlier i shared my

423
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,040
story in a way that focus on impact

424
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,079
globalization results and wins if i tell

425
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,079
somebody i let an audit great thousands

426
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,320
of people do that every day but if i

427
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,160
share with someone that i executed and

428
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,199
curated a strategy that found and and

429
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,680
led to over a million dollar impact on

430
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,399
revenue that peaks interest right then

431
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,920
that person will start to think have i

432
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,759
found a million dollars do we have a

433
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,600
revenue linkage problem

434
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,639
and am i confident that if we did

435
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,360
we had the right people to find it so

436
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,800
the way that i tell that story

437
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,120
essentially positions me as the person

438
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,199
to solve those types of problems it

439
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,519
shows i understand my business i know

440
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,279
where to look to find things that others

441
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,000
may not see right it shows i'm creative

442
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,079
i think outside the box and most

443
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,720
importantly the work that i do has a

444
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,440
bottom line impact so we have to elevate

445
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,279
the stories we tell and that story can

446
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,920
be one of many flavors right challenge

447
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,519
your risk management and cyber security

448
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,079
professionals to tell us how their work

449
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,440
impacts our future business okay we have

450
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,839
the opportunity to help craft that talk

451
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,839
track let's not just talk about what

452
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,799
went wrong but also what went right

453
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,640
as an info said leader supporting a few

454
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,439
business units i always maintain a

455
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,919
roster of best practices that way when i

456
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,760
work with other leaders we don't have to

457
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,480
recreate the wheel okay when i share an

458
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,240
overview of the business to my fellow

459
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,319
tech practitioners i present them in

460
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,079
their best light and we owe it to

461
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,600
ourselves to do the same thing for us

462
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,000
all right let's recap the methodology

463
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,240
first you want to align your goals with

464
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,360
that of your business partners okay hold

465
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,320
your infosec folks accountable invite

466
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,559
the information security partners and

467
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,400
challenge them to be more than active

468
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
listeners right we need to empower

469
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,559
ourselves to leverage our knack for

470
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,760
finding what can go wrong as we create

471
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,960
produce pilot and innovate okay measure

472
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
the results of your success and make

473
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,120
people aware and do the same for your

474
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,600
failures failures are just as effective

475
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,960
if not more than creating an impactful

476
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,400
story all right

477
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,919
so

478
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,480
first what is the goal not only of your

479
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,400
business but your tech organizations

480
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,880
right secondly you need to know who to

481
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,039
engage the chief information security

482
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,280
officer or your assigned be so is a

483
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,520
great start if you're in the business or

484
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,280
a strategic leader who's a decision

485
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,520
maker or operationally from a project

486
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,039
management perspective is great if

487
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,480
you're in the tech looking out to the

488
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,320
business unit next you need to know

489
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,360
where to focus find the sweet spot

490
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,520
acquire some easy wins by addressing low

491
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,480
hanging fruit and zero in on building

492
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,960
trust strategize on how to get results

493
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,799
from your infosec partners or from your

494
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,120
business and know when to move because

495
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,240
the right things at the wrong time are

496
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,200
the wrong things okay
