2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,320
the asvs is literally a standard it's

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,480
designed to be testable um a lot of the

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,480
other things that we do

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,320
for example the os top 10 it's more of

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,039
an awareness and training piece the asvs

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,720
is designed to be used by developers and

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,920
many others

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,720
when we first did the asvs um i think

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
the overall use was more or less as a

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,119
source code review checklist

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,519
but over time

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,800
it's actually been used for a whole

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,160
bunch of stuff including architecture

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,760
and things like that

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,960
the problem is that over time 4.0 is an

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,440
example of this 4.0

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,079
has so much in it should it have that

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,520
amount of stuff

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,120
so the other thing that we would

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,480
recommend i'm going to let jim talk

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,440
about this is how to fork the asvs

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,160
because the asvs is huge and maybe it

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
doesn't meet your requirements and we

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,600
encourage forking so yeah so andrew the

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,800
reason why my opinion is more issues is

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,519
better is because i don't expect every

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,159
team to use asvs out of the box i expect

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,799
no one to so we're adding all these new

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,200
sections on json web tokens we're adding

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,280
sessions on web sockets

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,360
but if your system doesn't use web

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
sockets drop that section and if your

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,920
section doesn't use json web tokens then

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,840
drop section so the whole point of the

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,240
standard really is to have a base of

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,640
requirements that is complete as

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,119
possible that we hand to you as your as

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,200
a different development team or security

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,159
testing team and for you to fork off it

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,640
to make it relevant and i've helped many

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,280
teams fork asvs the most common fork

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,479
andrew is to drop authentication and

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,560
session management requirements and

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,560
instead have a list of requirements

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
around how to integrate with our

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,759
identity provider that's one example of

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,920
how you can fork the application

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,320
security verification standard so it's

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,560
more relevant to your team

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,159
absolutely

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,040
so who's leading the asps well obviously

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,720
daniel cuthbert and myself have been

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,840
long-time

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,959
co-leads

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,160
jim and ella and josh are actually the

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,480
most active co-leads right now and elr

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,440
is one of our newest leaders

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,319
we

60
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,239
really do appreciate all of the work

61
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,000
that he's put in for us and he's been

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,640
amazing uh getting some of the stuff

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,239
corrected and stuff like that and just

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,440
simply moving through the tickets

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,879
let me talk about a lot i've worked with

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,879
him a lot the last six months alar came

67
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,040
at me a few months ago and said

68
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,160
jim

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,560
this the leadership of asvs is not being

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,640
responsible in their duty we have a lot

71
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,800
of pending comments and active people

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,720
and the leaders are not doing enough

73
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,040
work here and i got really angry with

74
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,319
him and thought about it and went back

75
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,680
to him and said

76
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,200
yeah you're right and i'm going to

77
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,519
change that and i jumped in as but josh

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,319
grossman's been super active when he can

79
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,200
i've after getting lectured by alar

80
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,800
you're getting getting getting slapped

81
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,319
by alar i became more active and he is

82
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,879
hyperactive he was right so he was he

83
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,720
was a little he's a little punchy about

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
it but he got me active again and he got

85
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,200
me excited about asvs again and his

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,239
comments are some of the most astute

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,360
comments

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,440
for uh for all

89
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,959
some of the most astute comments we're

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,120
getting from contributors so as

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,239
punishment to alar for all of his like

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,000
attacks towards me i we made him a

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,159
co-leader as his punishment so now

94
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,599
so i'm just saying

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,000
why why awar is so important to the

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,560
owass foundation is because even when

97
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
leaders weren't active even when

98
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,560
communication died he'd never stopped

99
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,879
volunteering and kept pushing because of

100
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,879
how important the standard is so i just

101
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,760
want to celebrate him doing that alar

102
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,560
lang is critical to the owasp foundation

103
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,120
and the work of the asvs standard there

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,439
you go apps 100

105
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,200
and actually having

106
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,280
healthy challenges to leadership is

107
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,799
actually a really good thing one of the

108
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,560
things i did when i became the co-leader

109
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,080
of the top 10 is immediately appoint

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,319
more leaders and that is actually saved

111
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,760
the old's top 10 2021. um

112
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,840
[Music]

113
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,478
lives change and we get busy i was doing

114
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,519
the top 10 2021 during the time that

115
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,519
was basically saying no one's talking to

116
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,720
me well

117
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,040
there's only so much time so yeah no

118
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
it's fantastic and it's healthy to have

119
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,800
new leadership coming from time to time

120
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,199
as well i i agree we and a quick note

121
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,400
like when when

122
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,759
uh

123
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,000
uh

124
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,840
let's let's charge ahead never mind i i

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,800
digress the beginning of asvs was mike

126
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,000
burberski and jeff williams in 2008 and

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
they were pioneers when it comes to

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,479
application security standards it was

129
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,720
earlier designed so only a small percent

130
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,520
was verifiable and 80

131
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,600
was more for pen testing there's eight

132
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,080
levels at that time and

133
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,720
why this is so important is at this time

134
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,600
there were no standards even close to

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,160
addressing application security details

136
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,759
and even out now in 2021 there are no

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,520
application security standards that go

138
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
into this level of detail so mike and

139
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
jeff dave wickers was involved in this

140
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,160
as well they pioneered a standard that

141
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,520
we're going to still be working on a

142
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
decade from now in my opinion and it's

143
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,199
really really a great project that i'm

144
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,880
really excited about

145
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
so the interesting thing is almost every

146
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
single item that mike and jeff put in

147
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,160
there and dave

148
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
is still in there oh it's still in there

149
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,039
now

150
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,759
oh the very few things were i thought

151
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,960
you're going to have a direction

152
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,720
no they got it right it was fantastic um

153
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,479
essentially the the first version only

154
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,039
had 120 something controls in total even

155
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,560
though i had eight levels but the

156
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,880
reality is is that almost all of them

157
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,280
are still there i love to give jeff

158
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,720
williams a hard time it's like one of my

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,919
sports but it was jeff was doing apsec

160
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,240
like at the before the industry was

161
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,000
named after same with buberski so

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,160
they're some of the real early pioneers

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,240
in our industry and their work still

164
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,400
helps us today but again i still love to

165
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,160
give jeff a hard time just a sport it's

166
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,039
just a hobby let's move on yeah okay

167
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,360
so the numbering we are coming up to a

168
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,199
breaking uh change and we're going to be

169
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,039
calling the next version 5.0 and we'll

170
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,199
show you some of those changes coming up

171
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,800
if we have some time

172
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,160
but yeah jim did you just want to talk

173
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,440
about the difference between

174
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,199
non-breaking and braking and why we

175
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,840
decided 5 was the correct choice as

176
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
we're going through the different like

177
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,360
4-0 is is an acceleration of activity

178
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,080
more volunteers we have like five or six

179
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,680
volunteers that are like reading this

180
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
meticulously

181
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,600
commenting on on different changes so we

182
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,080
were gonna release 4.1

183
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,960
but we we want to make a breaking change

184
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,639
and what that means is we want to

185
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,199
renumber the whole standard so a

186
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,120
non-breaking change is when we're

187
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,440
honoring the version number of each

188
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,360
requirement and we'll leave if we're

189
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,720
going to remove a requirement we'll

190
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,800
leave a gap where that requirement used

191
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,680
used to exist now when we go to 5-0 this

192
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,360
could be a breaking change we're not

193
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,720
going to reference any of 4-0 4-0 is is

194
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
is old and 5 is going to be a whole

195
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,560
fresh so we're not going to mention

196
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,240
where we change something or add

197
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
something or modify something likely

198
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
we're going to cut a whole new version

199
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,440
with all new requirement numbers so we

200
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,199
can start fresh and have a complete

201
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,440
standard and we really we didn't plan to

202
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,400
do that we wanted to release version 4.1

203
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,479
but the activity that we're getting for

204
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,199
changes and their astute changes

205
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,039
is so is so much

206
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,360
we have enough activity that really

207
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,639
mandates we we push out 5.0 and if we do

208
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,479
push out 4.1 which are still a little

209
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,240
bit debating i think that's going to be

210
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,400
a distraction to getting four point of

211
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,960
getting 5.0 out because at this point

212
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,599
even if we do release 4.1 it's going to

213
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,680
be pretty much close to 5-0 the changes

214
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,720
are so dramatic and this is a this is an

215
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,039
indicator of two things an increase of

216
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,759
volunteer activity of this key standard

217
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,160
and just an increase in the use of the

218
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,919
asvs i've run into users of asvs all

219
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,400
over the place now way beyond just the

220
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,199
you know the owass community this is now

221
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,599
something that's that's out there a lot

222
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,919
and i know that as a consultant i used

223
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,199
to charge a lot of money to write

224
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,599
standards for companies a lot and it's

225
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,000
insane and this is not this eliminates

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,599
that part of the consulting world which

227
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,840
i think is good we now have an initial

228
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,080
standard requirement and as a consultant

229
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,839
we can all help companies fork and

230
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,839
fine-tune their standards but with a

231
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,000
good common base so again the changes

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,479
are so much it's so used now

233
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,958
that we have enough changes pending in

234
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,040
our working directory the working

235
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,000
directory is the 4-0 english directory

236
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,240
the changes are so much

237
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,680
it mandates we release 5.0 next i think

238
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,440
yeah and i think honestly we probably

239
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,360
need to sort that out and maybe revert

240
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,279
the four to four so we've got a history

241
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,680
of it um because it's getting to the

242
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,839
point now where it's very hard to work

243
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,519
out what is still for

244
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,920
um but yeah we've got we've got to i

245
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,120
think we've got to get better at doing

246
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,040
git

247
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,279
we're getting better at andrew every if

248
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,279
you look at some of the new pro we've

249
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,080
added significant new process in the

250
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,160
last few months we have a labeling

251
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
system so we can keep track of all the

252
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,399
issues is the issue like waiting for

253
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,200
further discussion are we awaiting a pr

254
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,360
is it close but there's still lingering

255
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,160
issues so we believe alar set up a big

256
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,839
labeling system for all our issues

257
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,880
number one and every requirement change

258
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,600
we make now we're labeling it as added

259
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,360
new deleted um modified or moved from a

260
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,800
different number so

261
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,720
we're not sure what 5.0 is going to look

262
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,880
like completely but we're in the

263
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,000
requirement in the english 40 directory

264
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
every time we've changed something away

265
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,000
from 4.02

266
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,560
we've labeled it so we do when it comes

267
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,040
time to make 5.0 we know if that

268
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,760
requirement is new did we modify it from

269
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,200
402 is it is it been removed did we

270
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,760
merge did we split a requirement all

271
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,320
these activity but we're labeling every

272
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,800
requirement with that activity

273
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,279
so maybe we can we can cut a 401 and a

274
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,279
five oh please no but we can if we need

275
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,320
to we have the metadata ready for when

276
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
the the new version is going to be cut

277
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,519
whatever that might be

278
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,399
okay

279
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,959
so that that completes on the next slide

280
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,839
which is great

281
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,200
um we roughly released everything

282
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
roughly keyword roughly andrew keyword

283
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,760
yes

284
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,320
and so it's released in march 2019 so

285
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,240
theoretically a good time to release it

286
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,640
would be in the first half of next year

287
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
uh which is why we're working so hard on

288
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
it right now but will it be released in

289
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,720
the first half of next year we don't

290
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,040
know i think i'd prefer to have a really

291
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,959
solid release that's a little late which

292
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,200
is what happened to the os top 10 um

293
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
than to have an early release that's a

294
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,360
bit rough uh jim thoughts

295
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,279
there's another meta thought is like i

296
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,560
really think that when someone

297
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,800
approaches owasp especially developer

298
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,120
who wants to get into secure coding it's

299
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,800
hard to find that knowledge i would

300
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,920
start by

301
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,160
reading the oauth top 10 and then put it

302
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,320
down and then go read the asvs

303
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,399
requirements and then go to the cheat

304
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,240
sheet series to look at those up to read

305
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,640
about those details but this is a great

306
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,120
progression after you read the oauth top

307
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,279
10 which is a great way to start this is

308
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,200
a more complete just more complete

309
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,880
discourse and

310
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,440
i also i also hear that no con one of

311
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,279
the best conferences on the circuit go

312
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,880
to no con i hear really good things

313
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,040
about their organization and similar

314
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,920
and and and

315
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,440
i'd rather have a late deployment of of

316
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,800
asvs 5 than than hitting a arbitrary

317
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,519
time right i want to get it right and

318
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,079
finally i really think that not finally

319
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,240
i think we have the team and i don't i'm

320
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,720
not i'm not commenting on older teams we

321
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,040
have so many people active from a lot of

322
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,839
different um uh areas

323
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,560
that it's we have like critical mass in

324
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,639
terms of like necessary technical

325
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,560
diversity to get this done

326
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,920
and another quick note one of the other

327
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
main contributors is

328
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
the gentleman from the netherlands i

329
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,639
don't know how to pronounce his name

330
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,120
well sjord jord

331
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,680
s-j-e-o-r-d

332
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,160
he corrected my inc so i had a gentleman

333
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
from the netherlands who's natively does

334
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,120
not speak english correct my english use

335
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,720
of grammar in one of the requirements

336
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,120
and i was like that we've hit critical

337
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,200
mass at this point so

338
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
yeah well function

339
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,760
i digress andrew go ahead i'm sorry

340
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,079
hey i can definitely back no con has

341
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,839
been a great conference i had a really

342
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,120
good time there it's one of the best

343
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
ones i've been to

344
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,680
did you dance on the beach in goa andrew

345
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,880
did you

346
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,959
well i was actually staying in a hut on

347
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,959
the beach a few kilometers up the road

348
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,360
and it was fantastic i definitely will

349
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
go back it's it's definitely one of the

350
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,120
beautiful places in this world

351
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,800
um but also

352
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,839
um

353
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,800
just going back on that torsten uh one

354
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,279
of our co-leads on the is top 10 he is

355
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,120
one of our grammar people and he's

356
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,200
german and he doesn't speak english his

357
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,000
first

358
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,760
language

359
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,440
that makes sense right english is really

360
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,399
just german anyways right all right

361
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,279
i did not say that whatever i love i i

362
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,480
love

363
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,200
i do love it when my european allies

364
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,880
correct my use of the english language

365
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,639
it's a special moment

366
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,560
yep okay i just want to really just go

367
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,240
back on this fork thing just real brief

368
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,600
because we are actually running shorter

369
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,079
time i would suggest

370
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,839
if you are going to fork it

371
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,079
you can delete things no problems but if

372
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,360
you're creating new things that are

373
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,959
unique to yourself

374
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,199
um that aren't related to the ones we

375
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,360
have please use 50 plus because we'll

376
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,160
never get there and that means that you

377
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,920
you can actually then just keep your

378
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,399
stuff around as you see fit and keep on

379
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,000
merging with us

380
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,519
so what you're saying is if you're going

381
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,639
to fork asvs step number one it's okay

382
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
to delete item requirements just delete

383
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,959
them but if you're gonna add a new one

384
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,440
don't overwrite one of our numbers add

385
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,920
it to add it as a new number at the end

386
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,480
of the standard and then contribute it

387
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,959
back to us for consideration to merge

388
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,959
back into the standard you're not

389
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,360
allowed to fork asvs and make your own

390
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,560
requirements without giving it giving it

391
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,920
back as a pr or an issue back to the

392
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,120
standard is that what you're trying to

393
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,839
say absolutely one hundred percent yeah

394
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,240
yeah and if in fact that's how we got a

395
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,079
lot of the web service stuff uh the

396
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,360
gentleman from the netherlands gave it

397
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,680
to us because he needed it and he felt

398
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
that this was a contribution and that

399
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,519
became the web service

400
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,959
he's he's one of the most epic

401
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,120
contributors as well he's the ninja i

402
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,199
i'm not pronouncing his name right he's

403
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,279
one of our main contributors out of

404
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,880
netherlands you can see his

405
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,279
hyperactivity in github and he's another

406
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,160
like ninja surgeon helping us clean up

407
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,320
small mistake big mistakes that we look

408
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,199
overlooked so excellent yep

409
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,079
okay so we've got 5.0 in development now

410
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,600
we've got seven minutes so we'll just

411
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,639
get through the rest of these slides and

412
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,240
we'll have a look at it um

413
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,160
if you're interested in helping we are

414
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,839
very interested in getting help

415
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,000
particularly if you code because one of

416
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,839
the things that really interests me is

417
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,360
are the things we're suggesting are they

418
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,040
still relevant and are they still

419
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,880
effective because there's nothing worse

420
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,720
than actually having something in the um

421
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
in a standards such as for example some

422
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,480
of the um

423
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,560
itgc controls that you get asked in

424
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,959
supply chain questionnaires is what's

425
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,600
your password rotation uh value and it's

426
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,839
like why the hell are you even asking

427
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,759
this it's not an effective control but

428
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,240
it's part of itgc so what we would like

429
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,480
to see is make sure that people

430
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,560
are validating our work and make sure

431
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,800
that it's relevant but also as more and

432
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,040
more folks get into the cloud and we

433
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,759
we're trying to address in

434
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,000
agnostic way

435
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,040
all of the new cloud stuff but obviously

436
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,560
if you're a practitioner you may know

437
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,839
something we don't please help

438
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,040
okay so mappings

439
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,519
there's a team at ios called

440
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,240
the

441
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,639
project integration standards and one of

442
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,480
the pieces of work they're doing is the

443
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,519
crv which went into beta today i believe

444
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,399
um

445
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,959
i am very interested in this outcome now

446
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,320
we also have torsten working on the osib

447
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,480
which is a very similar mechanism but

448
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,920
it's generated automatically from the

449
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,320
owl's top ten this is more of a

450
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,480
mapping to make to match

451
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
all mappings i like the fact that it's

452
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,000
actually about requirements which is

453
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,959
roughly where the asvs lies

454
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,480
weaknesses aren't a good way of

455
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,240
developing software because there's

456
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,759
billions and an infinite set of

457
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,519
weaknesses but there's only probably a

458
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,839
very limited number of requirements

459
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,040
and so

460
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,720
i love the idea that there's actually a

461
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,800
common requirements enumeration if you

462
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,160
are interested in getting involved and

463
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,560
helping map stuff around this will

464
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,320
actually help us in the long run too jim

465
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
because it allows 5.0 to be mapped back

466
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,600
to form

467
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,959
if this is something that mitre is

468
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,640
working on or a cre and owasp project or

469
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,240
there's a few people working on it that

470
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,400
are actually not part of the os um

471
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,280
uh

472
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,240
you know

473
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,640
this is basically like a cve list or

474
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,079
like our cwe list but a list of actual

475
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,079
requirements like things you must build

476
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,559
in software for security as opposed to

477
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,559
discussing vulnerabilities did i get

478
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,000
that right

479
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,559
uh it's not so much like

480
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,600
the asvs as it is a mapping technique

481
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,520
okay i got you i got you

482
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,360
so if you're talking about sql injection

483
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,520
and as you know um

484
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,960
cwe79 what is that in the asvs

485
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,480
that helps this mapping 5.33 5.33 i

486
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,400
think anyways i digress it's not we

487
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,760
don't discuss sql injection wait a

488
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,000
second sql injections attack we discuss

489
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,039
parameterized queries in the asbs so my

490
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,600
ask is cre are they discussing

491
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,440
like sql injection or are they

492
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,760
discussing parameterized queries that's

493
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,360
all that's a really great question that

494
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,880
i don't know the answer to because i've

495
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,720
not been heavily voiced i would

496
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,240
encourage everybody to get involved

497
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,360
including us

498
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,320
this is the record because we're not

499
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,000
really giving a talk andrew and i andrew

500
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,520
and i are just convincing here sorry

501
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
about that

502
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,320
so

503
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,120
the team does actually have a leadership

504
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,720
meeting that this is actually how it

505
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
goes we we have this back and forth

506
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,559
discussion and we bring up the issues in

507
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,679
github and

508
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,000
we go bam bam bam bam make decisions get

509
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,200
it done

510
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,679
it's fantastic we do need to keep doing

511
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,960
that um so yeah development of 5.0 is

512
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
underway right now we're targeting a

513
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,600
late 2021 but more realistically early

514
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,280
2022 release

515
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,200
um we're going to have when we're

516
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,120
releasing our early version we're going

517
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,440
to be really loud to announce peer

518
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,240
review and qa but you can do that now

519
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,360
again if you go to asvs go to github go

520
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,240
to the 4.0 en directory english

521
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,760
directory and you'll see all the

522
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,600
activity we're working on so you can

523
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,679
wait for our release or you can do it

524
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,480
now

525
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,440
um june of 2022 we're releasing an upset

526
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,559
dublin i'm going to be there with a

527
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,360
guinness in hand post release we'll do

528
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,440
dot releases as necessary to correct

529
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,080
mistakes but this is our plan right now

530
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,000
uh appsec dublin oh and kerry i'm gonna

531

see you there

532
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,080
and we're

533
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,760
i'm looking forward to having our final

534
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,360
5-0 release

535
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,720
absolutely

536
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,679
um

537
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,280
okay just zooming through the last

538
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,320
couple of slides because i do want to

539
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,720
show everybody um

540
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,799
if you want to write a companion guide

541
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,840
from scratch from us around asvs there's

542
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,919
several others who have this interest if

543
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,679
you let us know i'll connect you with

544
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,520
the other folks who would like to write

545
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,559
a companion guide either and you know it

546
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,480
basically should be a reference to other

547
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,880
os material we have some ideas what do

548
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,120
we mean by this verification how can we

549
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,280
expand on it sometimes we'll point to a

550
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,640
cheat sheet sometimes we'll point to

551
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,480
another wiki page sometimes we'll write

552
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,640
a new guide for it either way this is a

553
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,720
great side quest for anyone who's into

554
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,840
asvs and wants to help us explain the

555
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,520
requirements beyond a one or two

556
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,360
sentence requirement

557
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,360
absolutely

558
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,159
okay so

559
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,000
if you've got questions i'll be hanging

560
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,640
around for the entire day at this one

561
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,720
here with the 20th anniversary flagship

562
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,440
project but let's go directly and have a

563
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,559
quick look

564
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,600
at the github repo um

565
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,559
jim can you see it i sure can so let's

566
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,880
let's go look at code andrew

567
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,400
let's go to 4-0

568
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,159
and there's let's go to english ian

569
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,640
just ian boom this is where all the

570
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
active work is getting done you should

571
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,600
see some check-ins for me

572
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,360
last night right so go look at

573
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,120
authentication

574
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,600
18 hours ago there you go andrew

575
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,000
yeah it's actually really busy there's a

576
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,320
lot of check-ins happening and this is

577
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,480
you know you don't often hear about this

578
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,000
work but it's really important that you

579
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,280
understand that it is actually going

580
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,960
ahead and we

581
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,000
love contributions and issues and pull

582
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,039
requests

583
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,400
um so

584
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,080
the way to influence us is through

585
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,760
logging issues and the best way to

586
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,640
influence us is the pull request

587
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,440
yes

588
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,039
and we like discussion first we like an

589
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,200
issue first we discuss it because we've

590
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,520
done we've gotten a lot of prs without

591
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
explanation we need to discuss this so

592
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,000
an issue is best first but

593
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,840
especially if it's minor

594
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
we'll take a pr directly as well but

595
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,240
however you want to volunteer and help

596
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,960
us

597
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,520
i'm open to accepting your volunteerism

598
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,000
any way we can so if you're interested

599
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,440
let us know

600
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,039
yeah the other thing i really want to

601
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,760
just highlight is that we did

602
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,080
in version 4 although it's got a good

603
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,720
renumber here as well

604
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,559
we have a separate section for api

605
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,640
call-outs now we're actually in the

606
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,919
middle of a

607
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,559
leadership discussion about architecture

608
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,840
and what should happen there do we

609
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,440
sprinkle it amongst everything else

610
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,880
personally i think we come up with the

611
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,320
right answer here which is sprinkle it

612
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,080
amongst everything else and have a much

613
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,559
shorter version one

614
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,840
i agree

615
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,039
yeah that's kind of my view well there's

616
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,200
a lot of duplicate requirements

617
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,039
it was a good effort but it duplicated

618
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,640
things we ended up like ripping them all

619
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,280
out anyways in the deeping process

620
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
anyway so we'll see architecture level

621
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
one that should really be about threat

622
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,039
modeling process i would dare say more

623
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,400
than anything else

624
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,640
i love rap modeling andrew love it

625
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,600
yeah i i'm if we pivot architecture to

626
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
be about secure design and the things

627
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,200
that would enable software to be built

628
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
securely i think v1 will be a much

629
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,360
stronger section that's a volunteer i

630
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,440
need strongly right now because all the

631
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
other sections we have an idea of our

632
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,240
plan architecture we want to rewrite it

633
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
to sync up with threat modeling and

634
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,240
secure design instead of having another

635
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,159
list of requirements so that that's

636
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,559
something a threat modeling expert

637
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,159
could really sink their teeth into and

638
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,000
help us for this next version but i

639
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,640
digress absolutely absolutely

640
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,799
um so if you are interested in getting

641
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,280
involved there is an asvs slack channel

642
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,120
obviously come and talk to us at the

643
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,720
github repo

644
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,320
which is a uh os asbs

645
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,640
you can download the last version from

646
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,720
our project home page but that's

647
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,159
starting to get a bit long in the tooth

648
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,480
which is why we really would appreciate

649
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,520
your input and help with getting 5.0 out

650
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,559
the door

651
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,080
and that's about all that i really

652
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,360
wanted to talk about jim is there

653
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,039
anything else yeah i got one more thing

654
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,000
to say andrew in the last like year i

655
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,240
watched a lot of the toxicity that was

656
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,200
part of the oaus foundation fade

657
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,679
staff are not like traumatized as much

658
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,760
every day now and like people are

659
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,520
getting along better at a time when

660
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,080
society is like having a lot of problems

661
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,559
i feel a lot of cohesiveness in the os
