[Music]

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,719
um so i just want to dive in we don't

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,040
have super a lot of time together today

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,360
um i'll start out just by kind of

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,720
expanding a little bit on my

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,920
introduction

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,320
so i started my information security

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,960
career in 2005 leading information

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,359
security teams at ebay and zynga these

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,760
were super cool places to be working in

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,080
information security and risk management

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,320
in both cases we were running online

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,800
operations 24x7 with millions of

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
simultaneous users daily

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,280
ebay had an uptime requirement of 99.94

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
and as one of the first major electronic

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
commerce shops enabled strangers to

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,120
transact with each other over the

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,399
internet

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,120
zingo was growing incredibly rapidly as

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,760
an early adopter of amazon aws

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,840
in 2009 the zynga game farmville

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,680
launched and in just a few weeks the

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,760
game went from 0 to 10 million daily

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,160
active users a few months later it rose

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,199
to 80 million daily active users

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,880
and now at cobalt we build security

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,560
software and provide pen testing as a

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,119
service like many devops companies we

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,040
are data driven in every aspect of our

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,119
business from product to engineering to

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,600
marketing to finance our business is run

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
by the numbers

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,400
i am thrilled to be here with you today

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
to share some of my stories and insights

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,640
from the past decade or so of being

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,079
obsessed with information and risk

38
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,840
i'll tell you a little bit more about my

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,159
journey exploring and creating security

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,000
metrics from ebay's global information

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
security team to authoring a book with

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,079
mcgraw-hill to conducting dozens of

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,920
beesome assessments to our latest

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,079
research project at cobalt the state of

45
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,960
pentesting 2021 which features data and

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,759
insights from over 1600 pen tests during

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,040
2020.

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,680
i'll also talk about if there's time why

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,360
i think the information security

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,439
industry is due for a new model when it

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,799
comes to thinking about information

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,040
technology people in process

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,880
i'll share a few insights about

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,640
different challenges i've observed and

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,719
encountered when using security metrics

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,479
throughout dozens and dozens of

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,720
different scenarios throughout my career

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,560
and i'll tell you about the best model

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,720
that i've come across for communicating

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,200
risk effectively to company executives

61
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
and getting them on board with managing

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,000
it appropriately

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,680
so i

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
never intended

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,599
to work in information security

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,520
uh when i graduated from college i

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,000
actually planned to work in it project

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,239
management i reached out to that hiring

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,920
manager who told me there was a hiring

70
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,360
freeze in i.t

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
he said that i should apply for a job on

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,519
the information security team

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,560
and

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,800
the rest is history uh a couple years

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,879
later i got a big break i was chatting

76
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,200
with ebay's new ciso dave cullinan had

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,000
just joined ebay from washington mutual

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,519
he asked me what i wanted to do when i

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,519
grow up and i told him that i wanted to

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,360
be the ceo of a small to medium-sized

81
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,319
company

82
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,000
and he offered me a role as the chief of

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
staff to the global information security

84
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,200
team

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
so a few months after that initial

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,360
conversation i found myself preparing a

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,080
slide deck asking ebay's executives for

88
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
the largest information security budget

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,239
in the company's history and soon i was

90
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,120
managing an eight-figure budget

91
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,120
six months later dave says to me

92
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,440
caroline we've got the projects we've

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,280
got the technology we've hired a lot of

94
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,480
people

95
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,319
now what we need is the metrics to

96
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,159
ensure ongoing investment in the

97
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,599
security program

98
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,680
this is not a one-time

99
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,599
thing you don't just do security and

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,760
then be done with it

101
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,920
so i want to share a little anecdote

102
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,599
uh certainly

103
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,799
at ebay application security was and is

104
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,959
super important and naturally we were

105
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,440
doing a ton of defect discovery this

106
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,000
involved lots of works lots of work

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,599
finding bugs through pen testing and

108
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,280
vulnerability scanning i actually worked

109
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,640
with himanshu we were all in different

110
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
roles at that time

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,840
and getting information from external

112
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,760
security researchers via responsible

113
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,120
disclosure

114
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,959
and so being on the security team it

115
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,560
seemed like every week we would go to

116
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,040
the developers and say here is a pile of

117
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
bugs it is super important that you fix

118
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,959
these right now and they would basically

119
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,879
close the door in our faces and pretty

120
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,399
soon they stopped showing up to our

121
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,079
meetings which is fair

122
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,600
maybe because we were just giving them

123
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,279
extra work to do

124
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,759
and so for security people this sounds

125
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,080
familiar and it's kind of a bummer

126
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,360
because it can feel like you're not

127
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,680
really making progress at work we were

128
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
finding

129
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,240
all sorts of security flaws and

130
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,400
vulnerabilities but that's only half of

131
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,680
the solution

132
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,960
in order to actually improve the

133
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,479
security posture of software you've got

134
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,400
to find security problems and risk and

135
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,040
you've got to fix or mitigate them

136
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,960
and so at ebay we teamed up the security

137
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,199
team and the development teams to define

138
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,680
a measurable objective for our common

139
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,800
goal

140
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,240
conveniently

141
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,960
the cto had just approached our ciso and

142
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,120
asked for security score for each of the

143
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,880
applications on the customer facing

144
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,440
websites this was extremely convenient

145
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,960
because his question put us in a

146
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,880
position to ask ourselves

147
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,120
well what did that score be

148
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,800
and so we decided that for every

149
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,320
customer facing website it was going to

150
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,960
be a defect density score we wrote down

151
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,560
the total number of security bugs for

152
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,400
each application and divided it by

153
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,479
millions of lines of code to normalize

154
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,000
the score across more than a dozen

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
different applications

156
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,080
and so once we had buy-in from these

157
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,240
executive decision makers our

158
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,080
application security team approached the

159
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,919
developers and said

160
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,600
historically and realistically what kind

161
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,440
of bandwidth do you have to address and

162
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,759
remediate security vulnerabilities and

163
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,320
so at that working level we decided we

164
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,120
were going to go for a 20 reduction in

165
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
the number of vulnerabilities on the

166
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,320
customer facing websites over a period

167
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,639
of one calendar year so we tracked and

168
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,560
reported the numbers every month to to

169
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,479
the developer teams to the cto to the

170
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,039
cso by the end of the calendar year we

171
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,680
had achieved our common goal

172
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,400
now i want to make a note that 20 is not

173
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,479
a number that security people like

174
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,680
security people like a number like 100

175
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,080
or 95 or 90 but the problem is if we had

176
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,199
gone and said we're going to try and

177
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,000
eliminate 100 of the bugs on the website

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,520
we probably would have just gotten the

179
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
same response that we got before

180
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,400
development teams would say no and stop

181
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,919
inviting us to their meetings they would

182
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,840
stop coming to their meetings and they

183
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,758
might even stop reading our emails

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,840
i had an opportunity

185
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,120
to write a book

186
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,840
this book came out in 2011

187
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,560
and now a decade later i have more

188
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
thoughts on security metrics and i've

189
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,240
actually put those thoughts into a

190
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,759
linkedin learning course

191
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,520
which i'm happy to share following a

192
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,560
session i'll actually make a link

193
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,280
on my linkedin that everyone here can

194
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,319
click on and watch that uh new course at

195
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,160
no cost and part of this talk is kind of

196
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,720
a preview for that course

197
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
so

198
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,400
a little bit after ebay i found myself

199
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,319
at schedule which later got acquired by

200
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,840
synopsys and i got to do bsim

201
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,599
assessments so

202
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,840
for folks who may not be familiar with

203
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,639
bsim bsim is a research project it is a

204
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,800
descriptive not a prescriptive model for

205
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,880
software security so instead of saying

206
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,280
you should do a and b and c

207
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,160
bsum goes around and asks people

208
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,440
what are you doing

209
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,560
and

210
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,440
at any given time it has more than 100

211
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,759
software security activities that can be

212
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,560
observed in the wild

213
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
so another

214
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,720
for me really cool way to do

215
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,000
data driven security

216
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,720
i want to talk to you about why security

217
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,960
metrics are so hard this quote is from a

218
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,919
friend of mine who used to be at this

219
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,360
financial firm

220
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,199
she had spent seven years trying to do

221
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,560
application security metrics with a

222
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,720
variety of successes and failures

223
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
there was a point when she couldn't even

224
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
get a meeting with the folks that she

225
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,680
was trying to talk to about her program

226
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,440
because when she had tried to talk to

227
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,039
them in the past they didn't understand

228
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,960
what she was talking about they didn't

229
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,800
unfortunately believe that what she had

230
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,440
to say had any value

231
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,840
so what i observed is there are often

232
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,400
two typical outcomes when people try to

233
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,039
do security metrics number one

234
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,639
they try to do

235
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,400
a traffic light thing and it's an

236
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,639
oversimplification

237
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,800
typical outcome number two

238
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
there's way too much information

239
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,160
overload i also just want to make a note

240
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,639
i am pretty close to pdx airport and i'm

241
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,320
aware that there is a plane

242
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,279
above so if it's disrupting uh the audio

243
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,679
my apologies

244
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,320
in our lives we get bombarded with too

245
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
much sound destruction you know

246
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,560
distraction and with information

247
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,080
and so we can run into this challenge

248
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
we're talking about security metrics we

249
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
can actually as security practitioners

250
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,920
sometimes we have a tendency to provide

251
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,320
too much information and that has the

252
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,800
possibility of diluting the meaning of

253
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,720
what we're trying to convey

254
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,560
and so today i want to talk to you about

255
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,240
a model for

256
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,560
effective security metrics

257
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,320
first and foremost security is about

258
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,800
protecting value and in today's modern

259
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
world a lot of the things that we value

260
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
are shifting from the physical realm to

261
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,560
the digital realm and that is why cyber

262
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
security is so important now

263
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
there are those of us that do cyber

264
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,800
security and there are those of us who

265
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,120
talk about cyber security and sometimes

266
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,640
that's the same person sometimes it's

267
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,080
different people

268
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,560
security metrics i think is actually

269
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,680
about

270
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,120
talking about cyber security

271
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,080
so

272
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,160
cyber security has many different facets

273
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,040
and i think it can seem complicated but

274
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,200
that it is not impossibly complex

275
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,959
there's a difference between complicated

276
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,800
and complex i think there are actually

277
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,480
fundamentals that we as industry

278
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,560
professionals can rely on and we should

279
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,399
not allow ourselves to get caught up in

280
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,519
the myth

281
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,360
that these problems are too hard to

282
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,720
solve

283
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,959
throughout my career i have had a chance

284
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,959
to be on two security teams as a

285
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,720
practitioner i've led a global product

286
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
management team i've done consulting and

287
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,560
now i'm at my first startup and so this

288
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,640
series of diverse experiences has helped

289
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
me to see that cyber security is

290
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,880
complicated but it is not impossibly

291
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,079
complex

292
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,680
even though nest 853 is nearly 500 pages

293
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,920
long and even though pci dss is more

294
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
than 130 pages long and even though the

295
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,160
bsim is more than 100 pages long and

296
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,760
even though the asvs

297
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,600
rather the bsim is more than 100

298
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,360
software security activities and even

299
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
though the asvs is more than 60 pages

300
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,720
long

301
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,560
despite all that i really think the

302
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,399
fundamentals of cyber security and

303
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,399
application security for that matter can

304
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,480
be boiled down to four basic building

305
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,760
blocks

306
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,880
this

307
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,480
number one govern

308
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,040
know your assets number two find find

309
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,959
problems number three fix the problems

310
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,040
you find and number four prevent them

311
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,880
from happening again

312
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
and so

313
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,399
sometimes

314
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,320
it can be complicated sometimes the

315
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,800
relationship between cyber security team

316
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,040
members and company executives can be

317
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
complicated

318
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,680
every successful business uses metrics

319
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,079
to drive action plans and achieve goals

320
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,839
most businesses have some things in

321
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,600
common which also means that it's easy

322
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,399
to define business metrics that can be

323
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
applied in a standard fashion across

324
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,440
many different organizations for example

325
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,279
many businesses are trying to sell a

326
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,000
product or service typically for a cost

327
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,920
often these types of businesses invest

328
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,000
money and resources to convert prospects

329
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,240
into newly acquired customers

330
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,560
so that means that standard metrics can

331
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,800
be defined for things like a sas

332
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
business this might include things like

333
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,480
customer return sqls cac to ltv ratio

334
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,560
because every sas business has prospects

335
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,839
that are valuable to the marketing and

336
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,160
sales teams every sas business has some

337
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,760
customers that stop buying the product

338
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,240
at some point every sas business invests

339
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,079
money into acquiring customers and can

340
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,320
therefore estimate the lifetime value of

341
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
those customers

342
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,639
but why aren't there similarly defined

343
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,279
metrics for cyber security

344
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,760
it's because whereas a business measures

345
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,600
in concrete units like dollars and

346
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,920
number of customers cyber security is

347
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,600
about measuring risk and that is much

348
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,079
more difficult to define

349
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,920
if you think about it

350
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,680
consider the risk management decisions

351
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,360
that you make in everyday life what

352
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
about the people around you i'm willing

353
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,040
to bet that you make different risk

354
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,639
management decisions than some of your

355
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,040
friends family members and other people

356
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,800
in your community

357
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,040
there is a reason why metrics are

358
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,360
straightforward in business

359
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,079
but not so much when applied to security

360
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,120
because

361
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,680
most businesses oops

362
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,880
sorry just turning that notification off

363
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,519
thank you for your patience

364
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,040
there is a reason why metrics are

365
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,959
straightforward in business but not when

366
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,519
applied to security most businesses want

367
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,959
more customers lower customer

368
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,560
acquisition costs and higher customer

369
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,279
lifetime value but security controls

370
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,040
come at a cost

371
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,720
and that trade-off is where the

372
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,560
complexity lies

373
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,320
so if you ride a bicycle and you don't

374
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,680
wear a helmet you might have made that

375
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,959
choice because you'd rather spend the

376
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,120
money on a new pair of cycling shoes or

377
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,399
you might have made that choice because

378
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,320
you don't like how it feels or how it

379
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,480
looks to wear a helmet these are of

380
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,880
course examples of convenience ease or

381
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,200
social acceptance cost

382
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,959
maybe you consider yourself to be a very

383
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,880
strong bicyclist and you're only riding

384
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,800
around your own backyard

385
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,560
but then again maybe you're a novice and

386
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,120
you're cycling on a busy road

387
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,720
when it comes to cyber security there

388
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,639
are often a number of different factors

389
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,120
at play an organization might not patch

390
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
or update software calls all of its

391
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
systems because they don't have an

392
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,800
inventory of all the system owners or

393
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,639
because those systems might respond in

394
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,199
an unpredictable way or because it can't

395
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,880
seem to carve out time when it's okay

396
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,040
for those systems to be down so that an

397
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,519
upgrade can be performed and so one

398
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,440
organization might decide to patch right

399
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,199
away whereas another might choose to

400
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,040
wait a month and yet another might

401
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,360
choose to wait a year

402
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,040
so here's how i think you could address

403
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,720
these things

404
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,560
you could start with

405
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
risk management objectives this is

406
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,680
something

407
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,560
that

408
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,279
i talked about with sami amigas years

409
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,399
ago

410
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,199
what are your goals

411
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,440
how can you get on the same page with

412
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,320
regards to goals for a cyber security

413
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,399
and application security program as your

414
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,240
company executives

415
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,000
you can agree

416
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,480
that good software helps the business

417
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,959
and bad software hurts the business

418
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,279
therefore we want to make good software

419
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,360
and we want to fix bad software or we

420
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,120
want to prevent bad software from being

421
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
built in the first place

422
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,680
so

423
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
you can start there you can ask

424
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,399
questions about achieving that goal

425
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,360
good software good bad software bad

426
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,360
you can start

427
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,519
on the same page

428
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,519
you can ask questions

429
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,600
you can answer those questions

430
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,839
with

431
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,600
data part of this is about talking to

432
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,680
people about security

433
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,519
people who are not experts in security

434
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,959
they're not expected to be experts in

435
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,519
security in a way that conveys to them i

436
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,560
have a plan will you go with my plan

437
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,079
if there's a problem with the plan i'll

438
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,839
let you know and i'll keep you updated

439
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,000
on where we are with the plan i need you

440
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
to know that i have a plan

441
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,279
and i need you to get on board

442
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,800
so we can agree that good software is

443
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,399
good for business bad software is bad

444
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,040
for business let's go one more level

445
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,720
down

446
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,959
so

447
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,839
at this stage

448
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,160
you're about to have a risk tolerance

449
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,279
discussion

450
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,880
with key stakeholders in your

451
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,480
organization

452
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,759
at this point you should have done your

453
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,279
homework you understand how your

454
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,959
organization creates value and you're

455
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,480
ready to propose a strategy for

456
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
protecting that value you'll also need

457
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,959
to present a plan and a budget and so

458
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,560
what's the best way to go about doing

459
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,360
this

460
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,199
i like to use this approach

461
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,800
that i call risk management objectives

462
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,920
so

463
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,959
i'm going to share these with you

464
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,240
there's seven

465
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,839
and along with each risk management

466
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,079
objective i will also suggest a few

467
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,680
questions that you can use to determine

468
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,040
if it's relevant to your business

469
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,639
operations and security posture

470
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,880
expansion objectives

471
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,720
okay here we go

472
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,639
number one use cyber security as a

473
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,399
competitive differentiator

474
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,839
how much do your customers care about

475
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,000
security because if it's a lot

476
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,440
then you should definitely be using it

477
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
as something to help you stand out from

478
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,360
the competition

479
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,199
do your customers expect security to be

480
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,639
a core part of your business because if

481
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,800
it's a clear expectation that it might

482
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,040
also be a clear competitive advantage

483
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,639
would your customers buy your product

484
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,240
instead of another one because of better

485
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,639
security if they would then a strong

486
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,199
security posture is something to talk up

487
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,040
early and often

488
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,880
risk management objective number two

489
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
comply with a regulatory requirement

490
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,720
contractual obligation or industry

491
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,639
standard which of these things apply to

492
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,040
your business if those include security

493
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,560
standards then it's a clearer

494
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,639
opportunity for you to use it as a way

495
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,160
to get folks on board with your security

496
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,040
plan

497
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,359
risk management objective number three

498
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,439
achieve a defensible level of due care

499
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,359
what does do care mean in the context of

500
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,959
your business does it mean that you keep

501
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,240
all of your software up to date and

502
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,319
apply patches regularly or that you use

503
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,679
two-factor authentication wherever

504
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,880
possible

505
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,799
find out what do care means in your

506
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,280
business environment and then use it

507
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,400
to promote strong security practices

508
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,160
okay here we start to get into the ones

509
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
that i get really excited about risk

510
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,240
management objective number four prevent

511
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,600
the same cyber security problems from

512
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,840
happening over and over again is your

513
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,679
organization mature enough to know if

514
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,919
the same types of issues keep showing up

515
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,840
do you have reliable defect discovery

516
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,600
processes in place and are the findings

517
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,440
from those being tracked or reported

518
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,280
because if they are

519
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,559
then you might use this as an

520
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,720
opportunity to use that data to make a

521
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
case for remediating the problems more

522
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,400
consistently

523
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,919
alternatively

524
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,679
are you finding about finding out about

525
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,280
security incidents from customers or

526
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,120
from independent researchers because if

527
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,720
you're learning more about security

528
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,440
issues from externally than from

529
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,760
internally your program may not be

530
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,200
mature enough to focus on this

531
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,919
particular risk management objective

532
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,840
number five

533
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,000
reduce the probability that malicious

534
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,480
attackers can stop critical applications

535
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,880
and systems from functioning i love this

536
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,720
one because i feel like if you go and

537
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,320
talk to a company executive and you say

538
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,400
hey company executive

539
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,919
i think we should try and reduce the

540
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,679
probability that malicious attackers can

541
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,440
stop critical systems and applications

542
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,000
from functioning

543
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,240
it's pretty easy for folks to get on

544
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,120
board with that but similar questions

545
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
do you actually know and understand

546
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,960
which systems and processes are critical

547
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,679
to your organization because if you do

548
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,760
you can create a list of critical assets

549
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,320
and use it to manage security activity

550
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,720
do you have defect discovery processes

551
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,880
if this information is organized and you

552
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,640
can associate vulnerability information

553
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,240
with specific assets and track

554
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,559
remediation status then this might be a

555
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,760
good choice

556
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,600
do you know what type of malicious

557
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,960
attacker is likely to target your

558
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,880
organization because different threat

559
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,480
actors may display different types of

560
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,320
behavior and you can use this

561
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
information to craft your strategy

562
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,880
accordingly all right we've got two more

563
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,120
number six require fixes for security

564
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,160
bugs for which well-known attacks exist

565
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
again i just love this scenario right

566
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,400
because you walk into the room with your

567
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,000
important security stakeholder and you

568
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,440
say hey

569
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,120
i think we should require fixes for

570
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,960
security bugs for which well-known

571
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,559
attacks exist

572
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,480
and similarly

573
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,799
this works best if you have

574
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,799
consistent and repeatable

575
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,880
defect discovery processes

576
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,720
if you have effective

577
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,559
tracking and reporting

578
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,400
uh and number seven achieve a comparable

579
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,640
level of cyber security to peers and or

580
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,000
competition

581
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,600
so how much does your company strategy

582
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,240
focus on competitive analysis if there's

583
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,080
a lot of focus

584
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,360
then this might be an effective risk

585
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,720
management objective to use in your

586
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,360
environment in fact when i was at ebay

587
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
and dave cullinane was asking ebay's

588
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,520
executives for a lot of money compared

589
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,600
to what they used to spend prior to that

590
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,720
time

591
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,840
he called up cso friends at other

592
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,679
organizations that were similar-ish and

593
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,840
said how much money are they giving you

594
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,720
uh so benchmarking uh of course

595
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,039
uh can be can be useful for these

596
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,520
conversations what can you find out

597
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,360
about the level of cyber security

598
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,880
investment at companies that are similar

599
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,640
to yours in terms of size number of

600
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,919
customers industry vertical et cetera

601
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,559
this type of benchmark data can maybe

602
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,159
help you convince your executive

603
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,840
stakeholders to make similar investments

604
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,720
if they want to keep up

605
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,679
all right we got five minutes

606
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,760
i have like so much more to say than in

607
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,280
five minutes so i'm just thinking to

608
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,200
myself what are the things we're going

609
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,559
to focus on

610
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,919
let's talk about a couple of

611
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,640
breaches

612
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,520
let's talk about 2017 equifax breach

613
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,760
more than 140 million people affected a

614
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,880
widely accepted theory that the

615
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,400
attackers were state-sponsored spies

616
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,640
from china a ceo who stepped down three

617
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,880
weeks after the breach became public 1.4

618
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,799
billion dollars to clean up the mess and

619
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,400
an ftc settlement

620
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,159
how did this breach happen

621
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,360
it was not because of a super

622
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,600
sophisticated zero day technical issue

623
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,039
it was because some software was found

624
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,480
to be vulnerable a patch was made

625
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,559
available and equifax did not deploy the

626
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,880
patch this was not a crazy technical

627
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,559
problem that lacked the solution the

628
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,799
technical solution was available this

629
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,240
was a lack of people in process

630
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,080
innovation

631
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,440
last year

632
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,960
we found out that thoroughbred actors

633
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,159
managed to plan malware and some

634
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,679
monitoring software which happened to be

635
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,760
in use by some hundreds of organizations

636
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,440
when the news first broke the breach was

637
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,039
described as highly sophisticated

638
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,640
targeted and manual supply chain attack

639
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,720
by an outside nation state which sounds

640
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,039
really intense and it is but

641
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,240
when you draw back the curtain maybe

642
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,919
just maybe it seems that they had used

643
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,640
the password solarwinds123 to protect

644
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
the company's update server in which

645
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,159
case it's no wonder malicious threat

646
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,760
actors took advantage and planted some

647
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,840
malware this is unfortunately a simple

648
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,199
security misconfiguration

649
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,200
four minutes left

650
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,360
we're going to talk about the state of

651
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,080
pent testing if i can get my slides to

652
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,000
play along okay

653
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,799
so

654
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,120
i work for cobalt we are a pen test as a

655
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,799
service company

656
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,880
we have a lot of data we publish that

657
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,760
data

658
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,880
and in this year's state of print

659
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,720
pentestinger report we reported that

660
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,559
security misconfiguration was the number

661
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,919
one most commonly identified

662
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,240
vulnerability type found across cobalt

663
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,480
pentest for the fourth year in a row

664
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,000
uh

665
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,280
as a pen test provider we see firsthand

666
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,440
how vulnerabilities make it into

667
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,360
software and systems that handle

668
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,159
terabytes of sensitive information

669
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,080
and so we publish our annual state of

670
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
pen test report to shed light on what

671
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,760
those vulnerabilities are and to

672
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,320
identify the trends and the hazards that

673
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,400
impact our community

674
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,799
we collect the data through our ptas

675
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,520
platform which connects security teams

676
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,679
with a thoroughly vetted community of

677
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,919
pen testers to examine their systems and

678
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,080
software and so this year we looked at

679
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,120
data from over 6

680
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,880
1600 pen tests that we did in 2020

681
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,480
and the most interesting trend is that

682
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,679
our customers have been struggling with

683
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,919
the same top five vulnerabilities for

684
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,640
four years in a row despite the fact

685
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,080
that they are things that are well known

686
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,440
to the industry

687
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,280
teams still struggle to effectively

688
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
remove and prevent issues like service

689
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
security misconfiguration and cross-site

690
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,600
scripting from their environment

691
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,159
and to understand why that was

692
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,600
we surveyed

693
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,919
more than 600 companies not all co-op

694
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,240
customers to learn how they pursue

695
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,159
secure development how they pen test or

696
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,760
immediate vulnerabilities and where

697
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,000
there is room for process improvements

698
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,919
for both internal security teams and

699
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,600
security vendors i think there's another

700
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,000
plan ahead overhead

701
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,919
and so what we found was a super

702
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,600
interesting mixture of pain points

703
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,320
workflow challenges and suggestions on

704
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
how pen testing can evolve as a layer of

705
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,480
defense that can actually help validate

706
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
the effectiveness of all the controls

707
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,840
that came before it

708
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,760
we have two minutes

709
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,120
