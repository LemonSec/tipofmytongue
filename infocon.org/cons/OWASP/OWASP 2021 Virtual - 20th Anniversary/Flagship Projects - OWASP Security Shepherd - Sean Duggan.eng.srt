00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,720
everybody

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,759
so thank you for coming i'm sean and i'm

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,280
here today to give you an overview of

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,759
the security shepard project

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,119
security shepard is what got me

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,800
interested in security

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,600
um basically i became a contributor back

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,800
in college

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,840
when

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,279
my friend mark he showed up one day and

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,039
he had this web-based ctf setup

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,800
that he introduced to the class we all

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,840
play it

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,760
and after that i decided okay i want to

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,600
contribute to this project

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,480
and so that's how i got into it at the

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,239
time there was

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,000
a sort of a gap in mobile content so

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,760
that's primarily what i've been focusing

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
on it was good in a way because uh it

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,640
got me

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,320
not only contribute to an open source

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,280
project

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,800
but it got me

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,480
interested in mobile app tech as well

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,120
and it enabled me to sort of dive deep

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,160
into that

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,399
and the project itself is a gamified

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,319
capture the flag framework it's got

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,479
built-in web of mobile challenges it's

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,880
got class management system and my

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,080
favorite part of course is a scoreboard

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,920
and so the main

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,560
contraries in it are marquee initially

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,479
uh started

37
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,960
and

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,880
he's essentially the founder of the

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,439
project uh his work includes the

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,680
creation of the framework and

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
most of the web-based content

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,200
there's also paul

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,280
he's contributed lessons lessons and

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
challenges as well as doing the

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,880
translations

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,560
on getting the project translated to

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,200
irish uh he's also ensured that the

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,840
project could be set up with docker so

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,399
it's pretty easy to set up at the moment

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,920
we have uh two ways to do it i'm going

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,799
to go over one uh the docker

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,479
method of setting it up is fairly

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,479
straightforward so i won't be presenting

54
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,000
that

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,520
and then there's me i've contributed

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,680
them mobile challenges

57
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,119
and lessons

58
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,399
and some other stuff too so uh yeah

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,038
that's uh here we are at the moment so

60
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,480
we um we're all based in ireland um the

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,760
three of us are

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,360
working for like uh different companies

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,800
we're all based in security as well

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,160
surprise surprise

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,239
um i'm currently

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,760
working for a lexus nexus in the red

67
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
team so essentially uh

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,840
my background is that i have to try and

69
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,680
play the role of an attacker and see how

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,280
far an attacker can get if they find

71
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,440
vulnerability and of course report on it

72
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,879
that's the

73
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,280
important part

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,080
and the project itself is built on

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,040
multiple uh technologies so

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,160
we use mysql as a backend database

77
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,360
uh it's a tomcat web application

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,080
and it's built on a jsp

79
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,959
and

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,480
it's running obviously like javascript

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,360
and html it's web-based so

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,959
the reason why you see on the left-hand

83
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,159
side there

84
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,000
in the language breakdown is so much

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
java is because it's a jsp application

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,360
and it's also built on android java as

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,760
well so if you go into like our github

88
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
page you'll just see java everywhere

89
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,760
um

90
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,599
and recently of course uh paul updated

91
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,120
it so that it's uh it can be said the

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,920
docker and so normally the three parts

93
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,519
of welding two main ways of uh

94
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,000
running this is either when you're

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,879
setting it up you can set it up as uh it

96
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,159
comes like installed in the virtual

97
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,879
machine and minimalize the ubuntu

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,480
virtual machine that you can just load

99
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,640
into virtualbox and it will come out

100
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,920
with an ip address that's how you

101
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,080
connect to it or you can do it through

102
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,040
docker

103
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,280
or if you're

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,599
more technical you can deploy the wire

105
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,560
yourself

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,799
on your own web server

107
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,640
and i mentioned previously that there's

108
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,319
three people contributing to this but

109
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,720
that was a white lie and this says we

110
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,120
have around 42 contributors

111
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,040
um and they've been contributing things

112
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,519
mostly to it enhancements

113
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,799
bugs

114
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,480
bug fixes rather

115
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,519
and

116
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,560
language updates as well

117
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,920
to give you an overview of what the

118
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
actual project looks like once you log

119
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,720
in and you're presented with

120
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,160
something similar to this so

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,880
the tool itself has a default look to it

122
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,639
but if you want to fork it on github you

123
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,120
can change to look any way you want you

124
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,280
can add your own challenges as well but

125
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,199
comes built with these uh preloaded

126
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,240
challenges

127
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,960
so

128
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,360
this here is a lesson everything is

129
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
broken down into either a lesson or a

130
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,840
challenge a lesson will tell you how to

131
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,960
complete the lesson essentially and get

132
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,639
the key whereas the challenge will give

133
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,040
you less information and it will be

134
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,800
subjectively harder than the lesson

135
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,880
would be so the lessons tend to come

136
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,919
first

137
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,880
and then the challenges come afterwards

138
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,560
in most cases

139
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,520
and you can see here that there's a

140
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
submit result key form and once you

141
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,320
complete a lesson or challenge the

142
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,800
result is always a key and you'll submit

143
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,120
that key to increment your score

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,800
so in this example sql injection

145
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,320
this wall of text

146
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,440
at first

147
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,600
people might skip over it but it's

148
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,880
pretty important because it tells you

149
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,800
how to complete this lesson

150
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,680
the next one sql injection part two

151
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
doesn't tell you any of this and it's

152
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,479
implemented some filtering as well

153
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,160
so you have to build on your knowledge

154
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,759
of the lessons that you complete to

155
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,440
complete the challenges that come

156
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,000
afterwards

157
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,880
and i mentioned languages earlier the

158
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,199
tool itself uh it's

159
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,840
it's got like uh english uh spanish

160
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,120
portuguese

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,600
irish chinese and

162
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
a variant of uh hindi

163
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
and

164
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
basically there was a push to get it

165
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,479
translated so we could access so we

166
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,680
could provide

167
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,440
um the ability for people from all

168
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,360
across the world to play if you see a

169
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,240
language that's missing or if you feel

170
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,919
that your native language should be a

171
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,400
part of this project

172
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,639
either reach out to me and we could work

173
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,280
together to get that done or you could

174
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,680
fork the project on github

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
follow the wiki that we have on gulb

176
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,759
which tells you how to implement a new

177
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,800
language

178
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,840
and then make a pull request

179
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,880
you benefit because you get to

180
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,960
you get experience from a contributing

181
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,720
to an open source project

182
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,080
and that's always a good thing to brag

183
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,360
about and see we benefit because now

184
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,680
security shepard is more accessible to

185
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,720
people who either don't speak english

186
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,080
natively or

187
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,919
have another language under under their

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,880
belt

189
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,680
and what's unusual to me is that um

190
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,440
we have a partially translated irish

191
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,520
which is not very common in the security

192
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,759
industry so uh i'd like to see that as

193
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,919
well because obviously it's close to

194
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,159
home

195
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,000
when you're

196
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,759
when you're signing into this there's

197
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,240
two types of users there's an admin user

198
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,120
and there is a player essentially the

199
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,800
player is somebody who's playing the

200
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,919
game they're trying to beat the

201
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,080
challenges and lessons and then the

202
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,840
admin user is the person who's managing

203
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,560
that so as an admin user you can set up

204
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,319
a classroom and you can have a

205
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,080
scoreboard assigned to that specific

206
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,280
classroom

207
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,639
and then you can set up a classroom

208
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,319
after that and have another scoreboard

209
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,479
and if you really want to like make

210
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,880
things fun you can compare scoreboards

211
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,520
you can get people engaged by

212
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,479
you know

213
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,560
employing this sort of competition

214
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,240
between classes

215
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,720
the um platform itself has a couple of

216
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
modes so by default

217
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
in order for you to progress in security

218
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
shepard you need to perform lessons and

219
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,440
challenges in a linear order but

220
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
what you can do is you can enable

221
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,720
different modes so with the ctf mode um

222
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,919
you have to complete lessons in that

223
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,000
linear order but if you're getting stuck

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,840
you can get hints

225
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,680
and if you're an admin you can enable a

226
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,599
cheat sheet so that even if you're not

227
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,599
like familiar with every single lesson

228
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,599
and challenge what you can do is have a

229
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,319
cheat sheet available just for you

230
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,919
and if somebody's stuck you can help

231
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:08,960
them out

232
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,840
um

233
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,520
the whole i find like the best

234
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,199
environment for security shepherd

235
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,319
personally um is when it's a classroom

236
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,440
environment so you're in a room with

237
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,680
probably like 30 people everybody's

238
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
signed in they all have

239
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,319
set up

240
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,720
and they all can access the application

241
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,560
and they go through the challenges and

242
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
it's even better if you have a big

243
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,399
screen somewhere or a projector shown

244
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,320
the scoreboard so once people see that

245
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,000
they get way more engaged than they

246
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,760
would be previously if they just had

247
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,679
challenges to go through in a linear

248
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,080
fashion because they suddenly want to um

249
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,519
be better than the person next to them

250
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,680
they want to be the best hacker in the

251
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,880
room

252
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,160
and

253
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
some of the other features that has is

254
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,560
you can um enable or disable certain

255
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,680
challenges

256
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,440
like maybe

257
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,040
if you just want to focus on the sql

258
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,279
injection you can

259
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,959
configure it so that only that's

260
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,519
available or if you want just mobile

261
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,720
lessons you can do the same

262
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,160
this is my favorite part of the

263
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,120
application it's the scoreboard um

264
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,000
so scoreboards are generally um

265
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
it shows the points and the username

266
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,040
that you pick as a player and you can

267
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,640
see the drop down there that you can

268
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,839
change classes to show different

269
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,200
scoreboards

270
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
now

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,640
another edition that isn't shown in this

272
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,880
picture we have medals now so if you

273
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,240
complete a challenge first you get a

274
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,600
gold medal second you get silver etc and

275
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,680
that adds just a bit more depth to the

276
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,360
score as well

277
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,920
and uh yeah so far like i found it's

278
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,720
just

279
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
what people seem to enjoy the most is

280
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,480
that competitiveness

281
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,279
and

282
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,279
as i mentioned previously i

283
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,600
do all of the mobile application

284
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,720
development

285
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,360
now recently i've made the decision to

286
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,200
uh completely

287
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,000
remove it and replace it with a

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,640
completely new app so previously when i

289
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,120
started i decided okay i'd make a few

290
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
mobile challenges but

291
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,240
maybe like

292
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,120
maybe like five ten max but i kind of

293
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,839
got immersed in it and i found myself

294
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,920
making more and more and more and it got

295
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,360
to the point where i realized this isn't

296
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,480
scalable at all so i have all of these

297
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,800
individual apps and they're fairly small

298
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,480
but they have like whatever

299
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,320
vulnerability is relevant to the

300
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,480
challenge so if you want to perform like

301
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
mobile injection you have to start the

302
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,079
mobile injection app um to get around

303
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,320
having people installing all of these

304
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,680
i created not a great but i am set up a

305
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,360
virtual machine that's running an old

306
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,600
version of android and it has these apps

307
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
installed on it pre-installed

308
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,720
but

309
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,760
that's fine but it's still difficult for

310
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,640
me at the moment because maintaining all

311
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,279
of those individual apps

312
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,920
it as i said it's not scalable so what's

313
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,160
best to do from this point going forward

314
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,320
is to make one up

315
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,440
um

316
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,839
it seems obvious but yeah make one app

317
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,720
and have all of the uh lessons and

318
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,000
challenges

319
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,079
for that uh for the mobile content on

320
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,079
that one app so

321
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,519
i think that will be a lot more fun as

322
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,000
well because it'll mean that i'll get to

323
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,519
make an app that's just

324
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,040
full of vulnerabilities

325
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,360
and i know like as i'll be developing

326
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,200
like android studio will probably be

327
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
shouting at me like well i don't publish

328
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,760
this

329
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,120
whatever but it'll be some good fun and

330
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,839
i'll get to um when i do like uh start

331
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,680
over i'm going to

332
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
use this to become more familiar with

333
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,440
like the more up-to-date android sdk and

334
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
what new features are available and what

335
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,240
new ways i can make a broken vulnerable

336
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,360
application

337
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,720
um

338
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,800
and that can be used to

339
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,240
cater new lessons and challenges as well

340
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,360
and if anybody has any mobile app dev

341
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,720
experience

342
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,160
i'd welcome any advice whatsoever

343
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,040
and we can either talk over slack or my

344
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,480
emails at the beginning of this

345
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,399
presentation i can share over the slap

346
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,519
chat as well

347
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,440
and of course there's the github page as

348
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,519
well

349
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,360
so

350
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,959
i can continue talking but i think the

351
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,519
best thing to do here is to also show

352
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,920
you the video of like the setup of

353
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,240
security shepard and the lesson

354
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,560
challenge demonstration

355
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
so get this up now

356
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
right so the very first step you would

357
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,320
do like

358
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,200
let's uh think about it this way uh

359
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
you've just uh

360
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,000
you've just decided that you want to

361
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
learn more about web application

362
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,320
vulnerabilities and you hear about tools

363
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,959
out there that os provides like um

364
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,639
different ctf tools neither side

365
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,040
security shepard to try so in that case

366
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,639
the very first thing you do is you have

367
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,839
to get

368
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,959
set up with a um web application proxy

369
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,800
and there's a fine example of one of

370
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,839
those so in this example i set that up

371
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,560
i'm not going to go over the full setup

372
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,360
and all of these solutions have readmes

373
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,680
and such

374
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,200
the next thing you do is you want to get

375
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
virtualbox

376
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,240
so in this case i'm running on the

377
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,720
windows machine

378
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,079
and then you want to get security

379
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,319
shepard to virtual machine version 3.1

380
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,800
once you do that

381
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
you're going to import security shepard

382
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,880
into virtualbox after you download it

383
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,959
and extract it and in this situation we

384
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,160
already have zap set up

385
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,839
so

386
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,760
with um

387
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
with the download from security shepard

388
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,079
jersey readme the virtual machine that

389
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,480
you download running ubuntu has

390
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,760
credentials

391
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,920
there in the readme and that's for the

392
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,240
initial setup

393
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,880
when you initially log in

394
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,279
you're going to get an ip

395
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,720
address here so if you follow this https

396
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,040
and the ip address you will get to the

397
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,560
web application because it's now running

398
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,920
on your machine or it's running on the

399
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,760
virtual machine hosted hosted on your

400
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,230
machine

401
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,470
[Music]

402
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,519
the default um credentials to log in the

403
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,920
very first time i had been password

404
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,240
um once you log in you'll be prompted to

405
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,560
change these

406
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,519
okay so once logged in the very first

407
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,519
thing you do is you sign in as an

408
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,800
administrator

409
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,199
and in this case uh you can configure

410
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,399
the application

411
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,639
whichever way you want

412
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,639
so for this example i'm going to open

413
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,440
all the web up levels

414
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,800
and if we go through some of the

415
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,079
features here like i've mentioned

416
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,680
previously we have the cheat sheet

417
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,239
management

418
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,000
we have feedback so if you want your

419
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,920
classroom to give feedback on how

420
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
difficult something was or

421
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,399
what they learned during um lessons and

422
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,320
challenges you can enable the feedback

423
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,920
feature so that every time they go to

424
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,839
submit a key before they complete the

425
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,480
lesson they have to like up well they

426
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,079
don't have to but they can submit some

427
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,199
feedback like in a form for example

428
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,240
and that feedback is saved

429
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,839
you can open and close registration as

430
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,839
well so if you're hosting online you can

431
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,160
then have different uh

432
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,600
like time zones available

433
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,040
and of course you can turn off the

434
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,920
scoreboard if you wish

435
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,399
and set up a custom database server

436
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,199
the um different data layouts you can

437
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,880
enable a tournament mode and open floor

438
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,839
mode

439
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,399
and it's basically up to you

440
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,560
and you can also block certain modules

441
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
so if you don't want the lesson to be

442
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,040
available you can turn it off

443
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
just a few feedback features because i'm

444
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,199
signing as an admin and then there's a

445
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,959
player management so you can add and

446
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,519
remove players uh

447
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,440
points or remove them like maybe if

448
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,360
you're hosting a class and somebody

449
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,399
finds a

450
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,079
interesting way to

451
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,160
you know be the challenge that either

452
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
you haven't heard of before or that

453
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,280
isn't in the cheat sheet then you can

454
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,799
maybe give them additional points or if

455
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,039
somebody's like maybe they're scanning

456
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,319
the application

457
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,480
generally uh with security shepard it's

458
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,880
a bad idea to do that because

459
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,439
this automated scanners can trigger the

460
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,400
um

461
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,839
score functionality so if you're trying

462
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,839
to submit a key and the scanner is

463
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,000
submitting wrong keys over and over and

464
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,280
over

465
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,799
and your score is going to go down

466
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,640
because you're just trying wrong keys

467
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,679
repeatedly so this is all about manual

468
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,280
pen testing

469
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,399
don't use a scanner at all

470
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,160
so in this example i'm going to enable

471
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,640
open floor mode so i can go through any

472
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,799
lessons and challenges i want to maybe

473
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,240
like in this case

474
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,480
i'm an individual user i can sign in as

475
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,000
a an admin and i can if i decide you

476
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,200
know what i want to brush up on my

477
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,440
crossover request forgery skills i can

478
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,240
do so by just um enabling open floor

479
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,760
mode and then testing those out too

480
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,960
so as an example i'll show you um how a

481
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,520
lesson works as you can see there's the

482
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,000
wall of text and you can hide the lesser

483
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
introduction and then right here in this

484
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,160
iframe here is the

485
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,880
basically the go to the lesson so what

486
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,080
you want to do is you want to tamper

487
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,320
with information going from your machine

488
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,919
to the host

489
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,840
and you want to do so in a way that

490
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,080
the host trusts the input coming from

491
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,600
the machine because

492
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,760
it's it's essentially been programmed to

493
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,799
think that

494
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,160
you can't modify the information here or

495
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,720
you can't modify information investors a

496
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,559
form and we're going to get around that

497
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,280
by using zap

498
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,918
you set it up like so

499
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,000
so one of the features i like about zap

500
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,039
is that

501
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,640
you get when you're sending uh when

502
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
you're intercepting server requests and

503
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,200
responses there's a lot of things like

504
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,520
headers and such but

505
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,559
it'll separate parameters as well so and

506
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,000
highlight them so it makes it much more

507
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,960
readable

508
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,720
and i find this is good for like

509
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
classrooms as well because when it comes

510
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,400
to teaching people um

511
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,840
then testing

512
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,600
the very like first thing you want to do

513
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,679
is you don't want to overwhelm them and

514
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,120
when it comes to like

515
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,039
cookies which are important to look at

516
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,919
right and csrf tokens and headers if

517
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,760
you're just demonstrating insecure

518
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
direct object references it's good that

519
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,520
this is just highlighted

520
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,799
so we can see that there's a guest

521
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,440
username we can change that to let's say

522
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,840
admin see what we get

523
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,720
and this is the first lesson

524
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,159
you get your key

525
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,600
and you submit it

526
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,320
and your score should increase

527
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,240
but in this case it doesn't so the

528
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,760
reason why is because we're signed in as

529
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,240
an admin and admins optionally have

530
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,120
access to uh scoreboard or rather have

531
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
access have the ability to update the

532
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
scoreboard by submitting keys you can

533
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,960
turn that on if you want but generally

534
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,679
um it's off by default so in this case

535
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,559
i'll go over registering a user

536
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,960
the email address is an optional field

537
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,880
so you just need to put in the username

538
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,960
and password

539
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,799
so i went over that again but i skipped

540
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,240
doing the same lesson again because i

541
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,760
didn't want to repeat myself so now we

542
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,840
can see that i was in the scoreboard

543
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
and all of the lessons

544
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,559
and challenges in this

545
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,799
there they have real vulnerabilities

546
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,400
and um

547
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,480
essentially although the vulnerabilities

548
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,320
are real and you're exploiting them

549
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,919
they're not made in a way that they can

550
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,559
exploit the over overall framework

551
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,440
so

552
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,360
it's it's a good mix of you know showing

553
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,200
people actual hacking techniques and the

554
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,679
results of them and in some cases during

555
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,760
classrooms people can get like

556
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,039
interesting results from this

557
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,320
so there's a user search here that's

558
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,360
vulnerable to sql injection

559
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,639
this is another lesson

560
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,679
and we can see like uh there's a lot of

561
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,000
help going on here so first of all when

562
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,400
we search for user which you could like

563
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,480
determine is like usually default

564
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
username like it's always user admin or

565
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,440
root or something similar

566
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,159
you're getting back um a result but if

567
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,799
you throw in a semicolon or a single

568
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,960
quote you can see that

569
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,880
you're getting back a database error

570
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,679
which in my experience is

571
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,679
99.999 of the time is an indication of

572
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,480
sql injection

573
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,400
also if you try like um just search

574
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,240
multiple times and if you try other

575
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,159
things as well like in other lessons

576
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:58,960
this

577
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,720
box will appear which will

578
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,559
offer you a hint now i know in this case

579
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,039
it'll show you the entire query that

580
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,880
you're writing and

581
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,559
the input you're putting into it and

582
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,720
from that it lets people more easily

583
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,039
visualize the sql injection attacker

584
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,880
doing because i mean in the wild you

585
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,440
don't always get that and so it's nice

586
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,080
to have it if you're learning

587
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,720
can see here that one of the um

588
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,559
one of the rows in the database had the

589
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,799
key

590
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,480
and that's a scoreboard

591
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,400
so challenges are a little bit more

592
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,720
difficult

593
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,039
and i say that

594
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,039
in that the challenges that come

595
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,640
directly after lessons are a little bit

596
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,039
more difficult they get tougher and

597
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,000
tougher

598
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
as you do more and more of them

599
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,080
and to the point where

600
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,480
from experience i've seen like high

601
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,440
skills students will usually get

602
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,559
between the first 15 and 20

603
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,240
levels complete

604
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,799
and um maybe security professionals will

605
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,919
get like

606
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,279
30 or so

607
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,679
it's all dependent on time because even

608
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,000
if you are competent and you know like

609
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,320
how to like complete lessons if you're

610
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,919
hosting a class in a three-hour slot

611
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,279
there's only a limited amount of things

612
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,279
that people can do so

613
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,360
what i tend to do with this particular

614
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
project is

615
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,200
i'll make it available to people but

616
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,039
then i'll host it elsewhere so if they

617
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,039
want to continue playing which in most

618
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,000
cases

619
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,440
a lot of them do

620
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,679
and they still have that option or

621
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,720
i tell them how to set up themselves and

622
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,960
then they don't have to like spend an

623
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,919
entire day like maybe 12 hours or so

624
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,039
constantly

625
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,200
like playing non-stop they can come back

626
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,720
to it when they have free time and they

627
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,520
can just learn on the fly

628
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,200
this challenge here is based on nosql

629
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
injection and i believe it was submitted

630
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,159
by paul

631
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,159
so we can see we're getting a gamer id

632
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,320
there's a uh db in use on the back

633
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,879
end as well

634
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,279
and the typical sql injection is gonna

635
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,039
work here we have to change the syntax

636
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,279
up a bit um

637
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,440
generally uh with this challenge if

638
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,039
you're if you're playing and you find

639
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,279
yourself stuck it's never cheating to

640
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,919
google things right so if you find that

641
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,480
you're stuck you can see it's now sql

642
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,200
googling something like nosql injection

643
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,480
chi chi and no sql injection attacks etc

644
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,679
eventually will lead you to the

645
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,840
conclusion that you can perform such an

646
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,799
attack here like this

647
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,520
so in that case i used it to select all

648
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,200
of the rows

649
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,679
and get the key

650
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,120
cool

651
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,749
[Music]

652
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,799
right so um

653
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,240
that's the overview of how the

654
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,039
application works so going forward there

655
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:29,840
is

656
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,080
still a lot of work to do and we have

657
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,840
open issues on github

658
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,400
um we want to perform some ui

659
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,279
improvements as well i mean just for

660
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,440
yourself like the application

661
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,320
looks fresh it's easy to use um

662
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,919
it doesn't there's not a lot going on in

663
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,360
the screen either

664
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,400
however we would like uh to get some uh

665
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,080
maybe somebody who has like experience

666
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,159
with ui development because

667
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,480
we don't and but i still think we've

668
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,000
done a fairly good job

669
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,480
um more translations of course like i

670
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,919
mentioned at the start

671
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,840
always up for new challenges especially

672
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,640
like

673
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,919
new challenges based on new

674
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,440
vulnerabilities would be a lot of fun i

675
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,320
