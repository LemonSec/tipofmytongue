2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,280
so

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,040
welcome to my talk welcome to the

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,400
flagship channel

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,559
i'm christian fellini i have 15 years of

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,079
experience running more security in

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,000
production and as lok has just

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,720
introduced me i'm the co-lead of the os

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,560
mod security callrail set project

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,199
in this talk i'm going to introduce to

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,080
coral set or crs as we call it i'm going

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,238
to show you a few key concepts what

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,320
we're currently working on what is going

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,120
on in community what future may hold for

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,480
crs and how you can join the phone

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,840
so let's dive

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,680
right in

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,360
crs

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
is a distribution remote security it's a

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,280
rule set for more security

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,079
security or a mod security compatible

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,360
web application firewall it's a set of

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,199
generic attack detection rules to

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,680
protect you from threats and risk

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680
nameless those as described in the

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,879
always top 10.

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,720
safety belts i reckon almost everybody

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,880
in the audience is wearing a safety belt

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,720
when driving a car

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,240
you're not driving

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,119
around without safety belts most of the

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,400
time

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,159
and you don't do this because you know

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,560
that a safety valve is protecting you

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,880
from going to an accident

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,680
or from protect you from any harm should

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,840
an accident actually happen

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,520
no you're wearing a safety belt because

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,799
it reduces the harm and because it gives

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,200
you a certain protection when an

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,799
accident happened when somebody bumps

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,280
into you our tree stands in the way as

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,720
in the photo

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,840
so

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,240
safety belts are no silver bullet

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,040
they're just one of several safety

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,600
measures in your car

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,640
so the return on investment is positive

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,320
for a safe development so relatively

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,520
easy to do

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,600
and it protects you to

52
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,360
a very good extent

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,320
so it's useful to vary safety belt and

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,280
the same is true for a web application

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,239
or c

56
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,280
or crf to be exact

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,920
it will not protect you from every

58
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,560
security incident far from it however it

59
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,040
has good

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,599
baseline security it gives a good return

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,000
on investments and you should apply it

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,480
to give you better sleep and to make it

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,959
harder for an attacker to exploit your

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,720
services

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,800
so

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,920
this is all based on mod security or

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,080
compatible web application firewall

68
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,040
engine

69
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,840
mod security is embedded it's in line in

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,280
the traffic it is rule oriented

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,920
on this gives you granular control so

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,000
this is no artificial

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
intelligence machine learning next

74
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
generation cloud enabled super

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,000
mastermind

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,040
this is

77
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,200
honest piece of engineering

78
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,319
that brings you a mechanism to deploy

79
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,480
rules and rules will then do pattern

80
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,640
matching on the traffic and decide

81
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,319
whether to block or let a request pass

82
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,480
so it's relatively transparent i'd say

83
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,239
it's very transparent but it takes a bit

84
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,720
of knowledge and then you can get this

85
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,000
running

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,720
so

87
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,640
mod security is the engine and then we

88
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,560
put the cordless set crs on top as the

89
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,760
next piece of the stack

90
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,480
and does it really work how does it work

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
let's take a closer look

92
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,440
here you see burp attacking

93
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,840
a volvo application the application in

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,640
question is vulnerable on purpose it's a

95
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,040
testing application that is deployed to

96
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,400
see whether security scanner like burp

97
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,080
is able to exploit it

98
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,400
where the burp is able to discover

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,920
all the weaknesses in the application

100
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,439
so burp here executed over four million

101
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,599
of requests again this vulnerable

102
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,840
application with

103
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,159
roughly a thousand of the requests burp

104
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,400
reported hey guys i think i found a

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,200
weakness i think this is exploitable

106
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,480
in the end this boils down to roughly 40

107
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,959
weaknesses so

108
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,560
a thousand hits

109
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,238
where we found a weakness

110
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,280
and 40 root causes of these weaknesses

111
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
that is the first column

112
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,960
the second column is the default

113
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
installation of crs crs 3.0 to be exact

114
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,040
and that is the five minute installation

115
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,160
that's just

116
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,720
app get installed off you go and that

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,600
brings you that positive effect roughly

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
80 90

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,199
of the weaknesses are gone

120
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,080
uh

121
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,720
pretty concretely s call injections are

122
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,400
no longer exploitable for burp

123
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,160
local file includes remote command

124
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,759
executions are

125
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,199
mostly gone

126
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,919
i'm not promising you that a skilled

127
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,160
attacker a really smart mind is not able

128
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,080
to pull off an escrow injection well a

129
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,759
really smart attacker is still able to

130
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,479
pull off an escrow injection but burp an

131
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,039
automated scanner is no longer able to

132
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,360
do it it takes brains now to pull this

133
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,080
off and this takes time investment and

134
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,840
resources

135
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,639
so the easy

136
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,360
simple attacks are gone and this frees

137
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,199
your mind to concentrate of the more

138
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,680
advanced stuff of the rest of yoga's top

139
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,000
ten social engineering tag

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
business logic flaws that you may have

141
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,000
in your application

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
so again crs is not freeing you

143
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,360
from protecting your application

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,479
source code

145
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,880
clean source code fixing your box

146
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,880
deploying latest versions supply chain

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,080
security are still important patterns

148
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,280
what we bring you is another piece in

149
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,560
your application defense another piece

150
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,759
in your

151
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,039
security program a first layer of

152
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,160
defense

153
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
so the script kiddies are gone the

154
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
simple attacks are gone the warms and

155
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,440
the points are no longer able to exploit

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,240
you this buys you time and it buys your

157
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,639
free mind so you can concentrate on

158
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,720
things that are really really relevant

159
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,919
good

160
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,880
so there comes additional columns and

161
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,960
we're going to return to those called

162
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
paranoia levels as we move along with

163
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
the presentation

164
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
good

165
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,720
next

166
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,560
here are other numbers

167
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,440
assembled by romo makon in the blog post

168
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,120
uh you want to

169
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,600
maybe follow me on twitter i'm linking

170
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,039
these resources

171
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,280
on twitter the address is in bottom left

172
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,800
as we move throughout the presentation

173
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
i'm linking these resources so you get

174
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,039
them on your desk or your mobile phone

175
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,440
so join with my column and try to find

176
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,319
out how good are various commercial

177
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,560
cloud offerings when it comes to the

178
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,240
detection ability

179
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,639
you want to compare the red columns to

180
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
the green columns as in the green

181
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,160
columns crs is always involved

182
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
and look at the third

183
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,440
line there

184
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
the first row s call injection that

185
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,800
confirms what i just said about burp the

186
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,160
green azura crs offering protects you

187
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
against 97 percent of the esco

188
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,880
injections that thomas macron tried out

189
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,160
the google cloud

190
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,440
cloud armor as crs gives you even 99

191
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,680
and even crs and culture is pretty

192
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,800
decent

193
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,400
honestly i don't really know what

194
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,880
cloudflare did to our remote command

195
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,039
execution uh protection rules or the

196
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,759
server side include rules on the top

197
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,880
right

198
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,120
but what the graphic can tell you

199
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,199
is that when you're shopping or

200
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,319
investing

201
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,520
in a web application firewall then crs

202
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,160
is your ticket to success

203
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,199
please

204
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,840
don't let

205
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,440
commercial advertisements

206
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,319
fool you crs brings you protection and

207
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,039
unfortunately the commercial competition

208
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,360
is not up to the task if you look at

209
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,120
this graph for example the commercial

210
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,440
competition is a joke and it might not

211
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,199
be so much true for the alibaba cloud

212
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,560
that they don't really know what

213
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,120
technology they're using the numbers

214
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,680
suggest it might be crs as well but

215
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
they're not telling us they're not very

216
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,440
open anyways

217
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,120
but definitely against the red

218
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,879
commercial buffs that are doing very

219
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,960
good in the clouds but they don't bring

220
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,759
you real protection

221
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,760
and that is a bit of a sobering uh

222
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,559
a sobering relevation so why is that

223
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,599
why are why is the open source offering

224
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,360
so much better than the commercial

225
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,040
offerings

226
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,920
let me tell you a story a story that you

227
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,279
know all too well

228
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,920
here is a boy

229
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,839
oops

230
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
oh wow

231
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,959
my my share uh i'm sharing uh

232
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,720
my screen

233
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,000
uh

234
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,120
as a pdf and it seems the emojis didn't

235
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,080
come when i exported it let me return

236
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,399
here

237
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,000
that should do the trick

238
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,480
so here is a presentation with emojis so

239
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,320
we have a boy here you know the story

240
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,080
all too well it's a story that

241
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,680
illustrates the reasons and incentives

242
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,399
why open source beats become a

243
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,959
commercial

244
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:35,839
so competition

245
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,320
boy is not overly happy because there is

246
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,519
work to do

247
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,680
the boy is supposed to take his sheep

248
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,880
to take his sheep

249
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,160
and take them to the forest

250
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,200
this is

251
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,480
very slow until ah let's just go on okay

252
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
so the boy has to take the sheep to the

253
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,839
pasture and guard them against the wolf

254
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,399
you know the story the wolf shows up and

255
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,560
the boy is supposed to to raise the

256
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,959
alarm so the hunters come and track down

257
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,240
the wolf

258
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,279
that is what we call a true positive

259
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,440
there is a wolf there is an alarm the

260
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,000
hunters come they track down the wolf

261
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
the sheep are protectors the hunters are

262
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,760
happy and so is the boy and everybody

263
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,240
has a big party everybody is happy

264
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,480
well with notable exception of the wolf

265
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,079
of course

266
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,760
but that is the game that you're

267
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,680
entering when you buy above and evaluate

268
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,079
above this is what you think is going to

269
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,480
happen however the problem is the

270
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,040
detection

271
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,519
the boy raises the alarm

272
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,959
very often

273
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,600
there isn't really evolve that is what

274
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,480
we call

275
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
a false positive

276
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,120
in fact that can happen with the call

277
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,680
rule set there is a certain risk that

278
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,800
sometimes this is not really a true

279
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,600
positive sometimes we think we have a

280
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,480
wolf but then there is none it's called

281
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,200
a false alarm the hunters go out protect

282
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
the sheep but there is no wall hunters

283
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,399
get pissed

284
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,880
it happens if it happens too often the

285
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,040
valve will be switched off that is very

286
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,839
problematic

287
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,720
however the alternative is even worse

288
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,320
and this is where the commercial

289
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
competition is everywhere

290
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,399
commercial competition will rather

291
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,279
accept a false negative and a false

292
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,519
negative means there is a wolf going

293
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,760
after the sheep and the boy does not

294
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,640
dare to raise the alarm because he's not

295
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,920
200 percent sure it's really a wolf the

296
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,480
detection is hard with web application

297
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,279
attacks you're never quite sure

298
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,200
now the incentive for the commercial

299
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,920
competition are as follows

300
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,560
if they have false positive

301
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,200
if the big boss of the company is locked

302
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,600
out of a web application he's seriously

303
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,240
pissed and he might not prolong the

304
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,720
license for the commercial laugh anymore

305
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,399
so there is a risk for the commercial

306
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,240
vendor but they're pissing off their

307
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,720
customers and that ruins their business

308
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,519
so false positive as seriously seriously

309
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,000
bad if you have a commercial offering

310
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,160
you're always risking to lose a customer

311
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
over false positive because you promised

312
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,000
him it's super easy and there are no

313
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,320
problems no false positives

314
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,399
and then a false positive is ruining the

315
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,560
day it's during the whole experience

316
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,200
that's why they would rather err on the

317
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,600
side of false negatives what is a false

318
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,200
negative a false negative means the

319
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,680
customer might be exploited

320
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,440
maybe it's only a penetration test say

321
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,720
hey look you have weakness there you

322
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,399
better fix the source code

323
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,480
and and maybe it's a real exploit maybe

324
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,360
real money is lost now imagine a company

325
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,320
losing real money will they disable

326
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,639
their wife no of course not they will

327
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,560
throw even more money at the commercial

328
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,959
life if that happens so actually the

329
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,639
commercial vendor

330
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,360
has an interest to avoid false positive

331
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,800
and if it's false negative he doesn't

332
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,120
care too much because this will even

333
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,040
bring him more money

334
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,519
and our skin in the game is completely

335
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,240
different we're open source developers

336
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,480
so what we're doing is we're spending

337
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,320
our spare time not enough for our

338
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,560
families and kids but we're writing

339
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,639
regular expressions to protect you and

340
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,920
your software from attacks

341
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,760
and if there are false positives we

342
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,320
really try to help you we want you to

343
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,040
open issues on github we try to nail it

344
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,839
down we try to weed out false positives

345
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,200
and we really have come

346
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,680
a long long way in this regard there are

347
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,600
less false posits than it used to be two

348
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
years ago let alone four or six years

349
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,560
ago so we're constantly improving

350
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,360
however if it comes to decide whether to

351
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,240
accept the false positive or allow a

352
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,120
false negative we would rather allow a

353
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,760
false positive and run the risk of

354
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,279
annoying you

355
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,920
and forcing you to work in this can

356
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,360
allow and exploit a wolf in a hoodie to

357
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,560
attack you and your data and your assets

358
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,959
so this is why we think the incentives

359
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,199
are on our side and that's why

360
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,160
we think the numbers are so much better

361
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,320
for the open source valve and for the

362
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,199
commercial competition

363
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,920
good so how do we go about this what is

364
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,959
under the hood when you look at crs

365
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,519
and you've shown you've seen the slide

366
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,000
with the paranoia levels

367
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,399
the default installation comes panorama

368
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,320
level one which brings a minimal number

369
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,920
of false positive and a good praise line

370
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,959
protection

371
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,440
we would say everybody hosting something

372
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,320
on the internet should run crs with

373
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,560
paranoia 1

374
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,639
then when you have real data and real

375
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,480
money involved maybe a commercial web

376
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,600
shop or

377
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,639
somebody or users really subscribing to

378
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,360
a service anything passwords involved or

379
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,600
real data real estate real people behind

380
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
it then you should go at least to

381
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
paranoia level two there you get

382
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,800
additional rules and these rules are a

383
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,360
bit less good when telling

384
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,519
hoodies and wolves

385
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,760
from benign traffic so there might err

386
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,160
on the false positive side you should be

387
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,760
able to help yourself in such a

388
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
situation takes a bit of knowledge now

389
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,720
on the side of the administrator

390
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,079
and that is important to actually take

391
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,920
into consideration this going to need a

392
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,600
bit of resources

393
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,759
then if you raise your security appetite

394
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,519
when you want to have a better solution

395
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,600
you go to paranoia level three we got

396
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,440
that is your online banking level

397
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,120
security brings you more specialized

398
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,279
rules and more false positives

399
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,440
and then at the highest paranormal level

400
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,880
for it currently

401
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,120
and that is meant to go for nuclear

402
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,199
power plant level security

403
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,120
that has been talking cheap but there is

404
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,519
actually a high security setup running

405
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,480
paranoia level 4 in switzerland for an

406
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,880
online voting system and i'm going to

407
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,000
present tomorrow in rome at romhack 22

408
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,040
21 about that system and how they pull

409
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,079
off a paranoia level 4 system in

410
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,560
production it's perfectly doable it just

411
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,880
means you need to weed out a lot of

412
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,800
false positives because these rules are

413
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,320
really crazy and they're super

414
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
aggressive and they will

415
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,959
they will tear a benign user into into

416
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,680
pieces unless the rules are trained the

417
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,600
valves is trained and the false

418
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
positives are tuned away and that is the

419
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,920
work of the administrator that we can

420
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,759
protect you with we're going to turn to

421
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,720
you

422
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,600
to that on the next slide so false

423
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,079
positives are there and they're home to

424
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,680
you

425
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,279
and you need to get rid of

426
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,680
they are expected from parallel level 2

427
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,279
and you have to fight them with

428
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,680
so-called rule exclusions on the right

429
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,320
you see a cheat sheet here

430
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,040
that shows you four conceptual variants

431
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,759
to fight false positives there is a very

432
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,320
good rule of solution tutorials at my

433
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,199
company's website netanyah.com and there

434
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,400
is also c-rex a rule exclusion software

435
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,599
that we are run at net near look into it

436
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,079
if you're haunted so animal scoring that

437
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,319
is a methodology that actually works in

438
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,839
production you reduce the animal

439
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,520
threshold gradually

440
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,839
and as you move down

441
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,319
with the limbo stick the stormtroopers

442
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,799
it gets harder and harder for the

443
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,360
attacker to fit underneath so the

444
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,440
adjustable limit and the iterative

445
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,320
tuning makes it easier for you to move

446
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,480
into a crs

447
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,640
setup in blocking mode

448
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,799
next concept and final concept we're

449
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,880
going to present you the sampling mode i

450
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,280
don't know why commercial software is

451
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,960
not offering that commercial apps are

452
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,440
not offering such a service or such a

453
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,679
feature with the sampling mode you can

454
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,400
define for crs to inspect only one

455
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,559
percent of the quests coming in so you

456
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,679
have a

457
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,840
working a productive setup and you add

458
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,080
crs for one percent of the request to

459
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,640
see what's going on if it fails then it

460
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,559
only fails for one percent of the user

461
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,320
and if the performance

462
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,640
is very bad then it will not kill the

463
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,320
server because it's only one percent of

464
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,640
users affected so you can tune your

465
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,440
system maybe roll back or you're happy

466
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,000
with the setup and you slowly raise the

467
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,080
sampling to 2 5 10 50 and ultimately 100

468
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,919
so that really works you can ease into a

469
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,440
situation into a setup without risking

470
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,840
to piss off your users again as an

471
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,520
animal in this

472
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,460
scoring mode that lets you

473
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,720
[Music]

474
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,120
guide or take one step after the other

475
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,640
be iterative

476
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,080
so you always

477
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,799
remain in charge in control of what is

478
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,559
happening

479
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,440
good

480
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,120
next slide

481
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,039
uh what about our project now um when

482
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,880
my priest western was a leader came took

483
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,000
over in 2015 he was more or less alone

484
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,919
in 2016 uh my current co-lead uh vulture

485
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:06,880
joined

486
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,840
and

487
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,520
we took to release

488
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,679
to class three so we took the protein

489
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,880
cla three the big major release where we

490
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
were actually starting to fight false

491
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
positives and we introduced these

492
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,360
paranoia levels that i explained to you

493
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,000
and the animal scoring was you now the

494
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,880
default this attracted a large number of

495
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
new developers and ever since we have

496
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,679
steady streams of new developers we're

497
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,600
14 of us now

498
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,520
a very diverse group

499
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,919
spread over three continents and very

500
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,919
happy women in our ranks one of our

501
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,679
strongest engineers francisco from

502
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,520
switzerland

503
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,240
as i am and we just promoted three

504
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,559
developers to become active developers

505
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,280
with commit rights on our github

506
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,080
of the 14 people listed here 11 have

507
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,280
contributed code in the last two months

508
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,400
so this is really an active a fairly big

509
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,320
ovus project contrasts to this many

510
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,640
smaller os project where there is a one

511
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,159
man fighting along for his own project

512
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,240
you guys and beyond you should really

513
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,640
join these projects and support them or

514
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
you join us because we have a lot of fun

515
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
when we're a large a growing number of

516
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,600
friends

517
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,000
working on this together and we have

518
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,080
very good meetings we do cool stuff

519
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,960
together to support each other's

520
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,159
and it just feels so different from

521
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,000
other open source projects have run

522
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
before but it was such a struggle so

523
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,720
this is compared to it this is a bit of

524
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,240
a i wouldn't say you're working with

525
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,360
sunshine but

526
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,760
almost almost

527
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,880
next thing going on is what we call the

528
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,559
devon duty program

529
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,039
that for duty program means that one of

530
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,400
our 10 or 14 developers is active on

531
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,360
duty seven days a week and

532
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,600
and he or she is doing first level

533
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,760
support on a number of channels

534
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
so this is free software this is open

535
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,000
source software but you're getting free

536
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,240
support between at least first level

537
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
support on several channels so with

538
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,320
course covering our github new issues

539
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,480
coming in within 24 hours you're

540
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,880
guaranteed to get a response recovering

541
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,520
stack overflow for crs questions but

542
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
we're also covering mod security

543
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,360
keywords and stack overflow and the

544
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,960
various sister sites

545
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,880
but of course looking at the serialism

546
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
of security mailing list and starting

547
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,280
october we're going to expand our depth

548
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,360
and duty program to twitter where we

549
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,000
will also include mod security keywords

550
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,320
and questions asked on twitter because

551
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,400
nobody's doing that

552
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,600
right now

553
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,000
thanks to our sponsors we can expand

554
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,480
this to 200 euros step us dollars per

555
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,600
week of duty for our debt and duties

556
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,960
so we have we're in a thankful position

557
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,799
to have real sponsors and we can now

558
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,840
bring

559
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,320
our developers in to support our

560
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,480
community with that money i think that's

561
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,880
a very very welcome development and that

562
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,400
supports all the crs users of course

563
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,640
next up at the end of october

564
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,360
is our developer retreat we've done this

565
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,080
before at around always conference

566
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,919
namely always europe conferences where

567
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,799
we met for a day or two and hacked away

568
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,520
and this time we're going to retweet for

569
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,080
a week again sponsored one of our gold

570
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,240
sponsors and for seven days we'll

571
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,919
retreat to this a little hotel in

572
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,159
switzerland right in the alps with 10

573
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,480
developers and a thousand ideas what you

574
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,200
can

575
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,760
nail down would get done within the week

576
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,559
whenever we meet it's like an explosion

577
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,120
of our mind there's so many ideas and we

578
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,280
we contribute to each other we inspire

579
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,960
each other and

580
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,600
we're working like man and i'm sure this

581
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,080
first time meeting of 10 active

582
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,320
developers would be a huge success for

583
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,399
us

584
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,960
so this is at the end of october

585
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,919
and

586
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,840
what is what else is going on in current

587
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,960
development

588
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,440
we're acting very active in keeping the

589
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,760
number of open issues those most of the

590
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,440
open issues that we're getting at false

591
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,520
positive and we really try to help our

592
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,919
users as fast as they can reading out

593
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,720
false positive we immediately tell them

594
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,440
how to do a rule exclusion so they get

595
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,240
rid of it and immediately but then we

596
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,640
also fight uh trying to fight this false

597
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,840
positive so future users after the next

598
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,520
release are no longer exposed to them

599
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,600
that is probably the biggest ongoing

600
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,240
book in the project we went down from

601
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,480
over 150 open issues as low as 27 and

602
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,159
that's about where we want to get out

603
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,480
because there is a third at a certain

604
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,720
time that it takes an issue to run

605
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,279
through multiple stages until we have a

606
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,960
working pull request that can be merged

607
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,559
we're developing a plugin mechanism

608
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,360
that's almost over now we want to move

609
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,840
certain exotic feature out

610
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,039
from crs into separate plugins the

611
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,960
plugin mechanism will also allow third

612
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,760
party parties to plug into crs so you

613
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,080
can bring your own rules and join the

614
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,159
scoring fund or do your own rules on

615
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,679
paranoials

616
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,039
and

617
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,840
that makes it more open and to work

618
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,640
together with us and it it lowers the

619
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,600
bar for new interesting rules that we

620
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,440
were probably not allowed into the

621
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,880
mainland distribution that's really

622
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,679
strict what we want to do there but

623
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,159
we're open to accept plugins to do more

624
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,480
creative things more risky things

625
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,400
perhaps and

626
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,240
that allows for experiments that may

627
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,120
ultimately come into mainstream or not

628
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,960
so this is like uh

629
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,159
crs for everybody it's very cool

630
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,120
um

631
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,559
we're the underlying uh

632
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,080
web servers that we're protecting are

633
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,760
not very good when it comes to all the

634
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,600
new requests modeling service like

635
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,120
request fortunate

636
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,480
that uh

637
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
portsmouth guys burp and many many

638
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,320
owners are bringing up and and

639
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,559
publishing and conferences and blog

640
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,440
posts

641
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,600
and we want we are

642
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,400
we want to see if we can uh improve the

643
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,480
situation there are certain things that

644
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,080
above cannot do

645
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,840
but we're convinced that we can do

646
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,760
better than because

647
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,080
the current states we're sure that we

648
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,320
can improve that and we can improve our

649
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,279
rules and we're doing concert before

650
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,840
they're probably at our developer

651
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,760
retreat at the end of october

652
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
we're going to set up usable demo site

653
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,840
so everybody namely security resources

654
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,919
can try out their payloads

655
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,960
and uh

656
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,360
ideally they would try their payloads

657
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,600
and when they publish they will also add

658
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,200
a slide and say hey look sirens by the

659
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,039
way already protecting this why is your

660
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,200
software affected

661
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,360
so that is the ultimate goal with that

662
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
and we would learn a few payloads that

663
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,559
way and a second benefit of course we're

664
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,760
thinking about using some of the

665
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,400
responding money for bug bounty so we

666
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,679
would get hold of new phones negative

667
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,640
things flipping underneath crs and we

668
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
could then write new rules for it so

669
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,400
that'd be really beneficial

670
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
and we're also looking into more ruler

671
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,279
solution packages for well-known

672
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,520
software you do haul them on a document

673
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
a dozen of those

674
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,039
so when you run

675
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,880
something like drupal or joomla php

676
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,000
myadmin or a wordpress there is a rule

677
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
exclusion

678
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,559
package that anticipates uh well-known

679
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,039
false positives and we want to expand

680
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,760
that also to plugins because most people

681
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,720
are not running and making wordpress so

682
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
that is still good you go

683
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,080
i'm slowly coming to the end of my

684
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,760
presentation now

685
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,200
and here is the summary

686
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,360
crs is the first line of defense against

687
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,080
verification packs it's a generic set of

688
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,559
deny rules for wraps namely against

689
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,200
attacks as described in yoga's top 10

690
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,360
it blocks at least eighty percent of web

691
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,520
application attacks by default you can

692
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,880
go as high as 95 99 if you're willing to

693
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,679
run

694
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,600
in paranormal level four

695
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,520
and more security and crs gives you

696
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
granule control over the behavior of the

697
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,480
back

698
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,320
down to the parameter level and i think

699
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,200
that is very very important for that

700
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,320
even if

701
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,080
artificial intelligence laughs tell you

702
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,240
differently

703
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,159
we're a very happy growing developer

704
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,320
