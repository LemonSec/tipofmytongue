1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,799
so um first i would like to wish

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,720
the overwatch community a really happy

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,200
20th birthday it's saturday morning over

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,360
here in sydney australia and it's really

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,200
a pleasure to get to speak with this

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,359
lovely community and close off this

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,400
session

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,560
so i remember the days that more than a

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,800
decade ago where i was desperately

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,599
trying to implement an algorithm which

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,160
was designed by a group of professors in

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
israel and that was part of my computer

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,558
engineering bachelor's final year

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:33,600
project

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
after countless of nights you know

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,320
trying to soften a really annoying bug

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,640
i actually cried tears of joy when i

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,800
finally managed to write the code and

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,440
make the bug to stop the bug and make

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,160
the whole program work so now those days

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,480
have long gone by and but i will always

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,559
have respect for all our security

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,680
enthusiasts and all the hungry learners

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,039
you know for those who have just joined

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,600
us my name is xiaomi tan so i am the

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,000
chief group officer at private sects so

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,080
as uh it is one of the top tier cyber

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,080
security consulting firms in asia

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,799
pacific and i lead our security outreach

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,240
strategy with the c-suite and executives

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,400
so i'm also the author of cyber risk

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,320
leaders and the latest book that's

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,880
coming to your local town uh and the

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,040
bookstores and even in the u.s because i

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,119
wrote this for my co-author it's called

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,280
cyber melee and the day after i don't

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,360
know if you guys are familiar dan lorman

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
he's the former cso of the state of

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
michigan so we wrote this together and

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,759
today i will be looking to walk through

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,079
a few key asterisks from my book

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,400
together with years of research combined

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,880
with speaking to more than a thousand

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,439
executives from around the world

45
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,479
so what does birds and buttons have got

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,119
to do with this whole presentation so

47
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,240
we'll find out shortly

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,960
now my content today

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,360
is very different from what most of you

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,280
have heard from the other speakers

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,399
earlier

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,920
if you are a security leader or aspiring

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,960
to head up security in your organization

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,038
in the near future you will find this

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,360
section really helpful on learning how

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,400
to speak with your executives business

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
or the board

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,920
or if perhaps you are an executive

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,160
leader or you're from the business side

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,920
and maybe you don't have so much of a

61
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,760
security background this will actually

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,480
give you a good overview of things to

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,239
key things to know and understand when

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,800
it comes to communicating cyber risk

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,959
so to start off with i will cover an

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,560
overview of the different risks with

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,440
cyber the five questions your executives

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,840
should be asking themselves when it

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,720
comes to dealing with them

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,120
and how do we communicate with the four

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,599
different kind of birds what's that all

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,720
about

73
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,440
and what are the buttons of our boards

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,280
and finally i'll end off with the six

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,360
success criteria for them so there will

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,720
be quite a lot that i'll be cramming

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,879
into this session um this is one session

78
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,720
that you will need to get your pen and

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,879
papers ready or your digital notepads

80
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,640
out as well

81
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,120
so for those who are newer to our

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,440
industry let me start off first by

83
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,120
setting the scene of the world today of

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,800
cyber risk

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,680
first of all to understand cyber risk we

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
need to understand that there are many

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,720
different risks that comes with cyber

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,840
we have been seeing increasingly

89
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,599
complexity of highly sophisticated cyber

90
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,760
threats

91
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,799
and also effects of data breaches are

92
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,480
now expanding beyond you know

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,200
information losses to significant damage

94
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,239
in other areas as in australia in

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,200
singapore and in many parts of the world

96
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,720
with what's happening also with the

97
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,840
hospitals healthcare infrastructure you

98
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
know it's not just data but lives are

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,080
being impacted

100
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,920
there's also competitive pressures to

101
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,000
deploy increasingly cost effective

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,080
business technologies

103
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,319
greater connectivity especially with

104
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,560
covet you know where we have seen and

105
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,280
increased digitalized movement for

106
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
example you know your smart devices

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,439
cloud computing real device bring your

108
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,120
own application 24x7 access to data

109
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,959
or your disgruntled fully trained

110
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,920
employees you know subcontractors

111
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,079
and there are more economically

112
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,358
motivated cyber attackers as well

113
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,600
there are smaller organizations with

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,479
fewer security resources

115
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,880
huge reliance on international supply

116
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,000
chain

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,880
and what about new risk that comes with

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,120
merger and acquisitions

119
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
so there there is a whole shift in

120
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,720
hacking you know that we are seeing

121
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,400
these days you know targeting less and

122
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,840
less machines and more and more humans

123
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,120
so

124
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,840
cyber definition may really need to be

125
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,080
redefined to include risks such as

126
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,759
privacy misinformation physical security

127
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,720
ics and ict now i've only scrapped the

128
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,440
surface of this risk but there's too

129
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,080
many if much information overload if i

130
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,400
were to go on and it's not realistic to

131
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,880
educate our executives on every single

132
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,520
possible risk that can exist so we need

133
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,919
to make it really simple for them and if

134
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,000
you are an executive here's just five

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,440
questions that you need to be asking

136
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,120
yourselves to know if you are dealing

137
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,759
with cyber risk effectively

138
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,479
so the first one would be you know what

139
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,360
data do we care about do you know

140
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,759
who would find your organizational data

141
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,199
available

142
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,120
who would want to do it

143
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,919
which data is stolen or blocked would

144
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,360
cause organizational damage

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,440
second you know where is our data stored

146
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,479
but is it onshore offshore is it cloud

147
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,960
is there a service provider have they

148
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,639
shared information with third parties

149
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,479
another question that the executives

150
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,800
need to ask themselves who is able to

151
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,360
access our organizational data or have

152
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,080
super user admin privileges do we

153
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,199
regularly check to see who has access do

154
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,280
we restrict it to those who only need it

155
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,680
to do their job

156
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,319
the fourth question is how is our data

157
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,039
secure who is protecting our data how is

158
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,080
this being done and how well

159
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,039
and finally how do we respond if there

160
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,800
is a compromise

161
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,639
as an executive do you know what

162
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,440
security systems that currently exist do

163
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,199
you know where they are who do we

164
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,720
contact and how in the event of a bridge

165
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,120
so now having worked with hundreds of

166
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,280
leaders and being in this industry for

167
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,840
now more than a decade the issue here is

168
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,960
not so much about our lack of knowledge

169
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,759
but unfortunately i see a lot of common

170
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,680
excuses coming up as well from the

171
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,960
business on why good practices are not

172
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,840
being implemented

173
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,800
so dan lahmann who is the former cso

174
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,319
state of michigan that i introduced

175
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,400
earlier who's based in the u.s

176
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
now um

177
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,160
we wrote this next segment together

178
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,360
where it contains we studied a lot of

179
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,000
true cyber emergency stories and how

180
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
business leaders can really better

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,400
prepare and manage and recover their

182
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,120
organization with inevitable business

183
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,639
disruptions

184
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,280
so one of the chapters we explore the 10

185
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,479
common excuses for best practice equity

186
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,880
and i've highlighted our top five tips

187
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
in the next few slides to help as well

188
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,199
to help you guys so here are some of the

189
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,960
common excuses

190
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,120
we could not afford it

191
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,520
the business didn't understand why it

192
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
was necessary

193
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,479
we tried it before and it didn't work

194
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,160
it's too hard

195
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
or to be honest we were afraid of what

196
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,800
we might discover

197
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
now in one of the

198
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,400
chapters here

199
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,440
for for cyber media and the day after i

200
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,360
provided a comprehensive coverage of

201
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,599
tips and solutions to help overcome

202
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,080
these ex-users

203
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,599
so if you look at a few key factors over

204
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,800
here

205
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,039
we have time culture budget risk allies

206
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
and environment and i would suggest this

207
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,879
as question checklist that you can

208
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,360
challenge your thinking and ask if you

209
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,440
are asking the right questions

210
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,680
so number one where are we spending the

211
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,080
bulk of our time are we allocating our

212
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,160
time proportionally according to the

213
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,840
criticality levels of

214
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,440
risk when it comes to

215
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,120
budget are there other areas where

216
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,199
spending our budget on that can be

217
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,599
reallocated how does our budget align

218
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,159
with the current company's strategy and

219
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,320
business risk

220
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,799
what is the current security awareness

221
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,360
culture like among the leadership team

222
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,519
are you aware of that and how does it

223
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,480
cascade to the different divisions

224
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,399
and what was the organizational

225
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,160
environment like when your approach

226
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
didn't work you know how can change be

227
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,839
done and executed differently this time

228
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,440
have you look at the mechanics of

229
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,600
influence

230
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,680
have you tried getting airlines so that

231
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,640
it is not just you fighting an

232
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,760
organizational battle

233
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,440
are there other battles that might

234
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,320
result in better outcomes you know what

235
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
are some other smaller initial

236
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,240
commitments that you can focus on

237
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,880
securing from your stakeholders first

238
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,279
and then working your way on getting

239
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,040
more buy-in from the rest of the

240
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,880
stakeholders

241
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,120
and finally are you comfortable with not

242
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
knowing what other malicious attackers

243
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,120
that are out there that would know

244
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,040
things about your company

245
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,279
how are you managing your risk if you do

246
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,120
not know what needs to be managed

247
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,680
so we need to be constantly learning

248
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,320
from incidents whether internally or

249
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,560
externally even if they don't directly

250
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,320
impact us

251
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,560
if we recognize that disruption is

252
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,040
continuous rather than just based on

253
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,839
episodes we can shift our responses from

254
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,480
being reactive to making the first move

255
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,399
so here are some tips that i've put

256
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,480
together that can help you overcome

257
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,079
good practice efforting

258
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,920
make failure real

259
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,160
exercises is a must right we have to

260
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,480
practice practice and practice and here

261
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,320
are some additional questions for you

262
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
you know what is your mindset and what's

263
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,440
the leadership views on cyber failures

264
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,920
who is accountable how can you build a

265
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,000
culture and work environment that does

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
not finger point

267
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,800
but encourages transparency in sharing

268
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,320
lessons learned and mistakes owned

269
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,079
fmea i don't know how many of you

270
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,600
familiar with that which is the failure

271
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
mode effective analysis you know create

272
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
a structured process

273
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,160
so question for you do you know your

274
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,920
industrial peers you know what are they

275
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,320
using how does your process benchmark

276
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,399
against yes

277
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,399
regular reports on readiness to

278
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,000
management helps

279
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,959
do you know what has been the impact on

280
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,880
other organizations who do not have a

281
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,399
bcp

282
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,320
how does your bcp compare in your

283
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,800
industry sector you know what are the

284
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,279
different lessons learned each time it

285
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,279
is being run

286
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,360
and the fourth what is your current

287
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,160
process how often have you reviewed your

288
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,360
process

289
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,600
are there ways of doing this more

290
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,839
effectively

291
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,079
fifth get a second opinion we are

292
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,200
stronger together how can you play your

293
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,320
strengths

294
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,399
while leveraging the community

295
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,640
or collaborating with existing or new

296
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,920
partnerships

297
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,440
to complement

298
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,839
and also strengthen your business case

299
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,160
our ciso leaders are experts in

300
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,640
understanding the issue but it is one

301
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,560
thing to understand the issue and

302
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
another to address it effectively

303
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
security professionals often fall into

304
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,760
the trap of using too much technical

305
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,639
and providing too much data right now if

306
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,560
you're presenting to the board or you

307
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,959
get a chance to right unlike the

308
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,800
executives they are not going to be

309
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,320
interested in the details of the

310
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
operational aspects

311
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,720
on the other hand risk and compliance

312
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,639
will be their trigger buttons and that's

313
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,639
the language you need to use

314
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,040
your metrics report needs to be measured

315
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,760
against business requirements and any

316
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,440
strategic plans

317
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,320
need to demonstrate why security is a

318
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,200
means to business outcome in terms of

319
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,040
value preservation or growth

320
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,120
over time you want to be showing trends

321
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,440
of improvement tell the story to the

322
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,000
board not just focusing on issues but

323
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,160
also what you are doing right

324
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,519
and how do you do that

325
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,240
how many of you have heard of dope

326
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,720
d-o-p-e which is an acronym that stands

327
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,000
for deaf

328
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
our

329
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,480
peacock and eagles so it's a personality

330
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,800
test and this tool is actually really

331
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,959
available for those who are earnestly

332
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,760
interested in self-discovery

333
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,639
it can help you make sense and

334
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,760
understand why certain people tend to

335
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,240
communicate in a certain way

336
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,320
really interesting um research to look

337
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
into as well because most people have a

338
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,880
dominant combination of at least two

339
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
birds

340
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,839
so the

341
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
ego you know the eagles bold dominant

342
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,760
decisive and direct and they are very

343
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,440
stimulated by challenge they are

344
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,200
straight students and a lot of the

345
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,440
leaders tend to have ego like quality

346
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,399
i had a cio of toe on one of my blackout

347
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,560
series shows on youtube channel you can

348
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,199
find it he actually walked through toes

349
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,600
incident and examines the leadership

350
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,320
response on hindsight for those who are

351
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,240
not familiar with toe group they are a

352
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,000
logistic giant that operates an

353
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,519
extensive diverse road asc and rail

354
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,480
freight transport services across 1 200

355
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,639
locations in more than 50 other

356
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,720
countries but they suffered a major

357
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,360
cyber attack and their i.t systems were

358
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,079
taken offline twice in the span of three

359
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,480
months early 2020

360
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,639
and if i want to look at toa's incident

361
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,720
it is impo really important to display

362
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,279
your ego quality you know when your

363
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,120
second bridge happened the first

364
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,360
question that was not just on the ceo's

365
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,680
mind but also

366
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,279
being questioned from the rest of the

367
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,120
business is this

368
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,560
how soon can our systems be recovered

369
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,639
now the expectation of the team is that

370
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,920
they should be able to recover the

371
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,040
systems and get back online a lot faster

372
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,800
especially since they would have learned

373
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,199
the lessons i mean it was it was thought

374
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,639
that they would have learned the lessons

375
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,399
right after their first attack and now

376
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,279
have a better process in place

377
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,199
now it was a very difficult situation to

378
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,399
be in but kingly who is their cio had to

379
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,079
be really direct you know this is the

380
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,760
second time that they have been hit

381
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,440
which only proves that there are many

382
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,040
actors waiting to attack them again

383
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,279
so told cio told me this you know we

384
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,440
need to make sure that when we bring the

385
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,560
system back online it has got to be

386
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,519
better

387
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,399
safer and stronger than when we went

388
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,440
down

389
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,839
king reframed the conversation and

390
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,600
mindset to save team before speed

391
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,360
those approach is then to share with

392
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,880
your customers the reason for their

393
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,040
delay the measures they have taken to

394
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,519
build a stronger and safer system so

395
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,120
that when they bring it back online

396
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,360
again customers would have more

397
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,519
confidence

398
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,600
they might have to wait a little longer

399
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,680
but at least you know it is worth the

400
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,040
wait

401
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,680
king also shared that on hindsight you

402
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
know as an additional stat they could

403
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,160
have done is perhaps help their

404
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,279
customers

405
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,440
better communicate with their own

406
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,839
customers right and cascade that

407
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,399
downwards to those who are also impacted

408
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,480
because for some of their customers they

409
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,160
struggle with translating toes

410
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,880
communication in their contacts

411
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,199
for their own customers so in managing

412
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,839
crisis communication the approach and

413
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,040
content is really important and if you

414
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,199
take into consideration the forward

415
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,440
personalities of the audience you will

416
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,199
be able to craft a very effective

417
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,199
message one that also takes into

418
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,519
consideration the cultural context of

419
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,360
your audience and the different

420
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,800
personalities now um the second word is

421
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,120
actually the opposite of of ego you know

422
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,480
what do you think

423
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,079
you know when you look at your death

424
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,000
right they are usually a representation

425
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,279
of peace

426
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,759
the devs are more people oriented they

427
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,880
are team players they tend to avoid risk

428
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,399
they operate and trust and once you have

429
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,240
earned their trust they tend to be quite

430
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,440
loyal

431
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,600
they don't like to be pushed into making

432
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,279
decisions

433
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,279
and i wouldn't spend so much time going

434
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,680
into debt fear but you know feel free to

435
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,839
research further on these different

436
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,079
personality traits

437
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,320
when you look at hours

438
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,120
well the hour right they are very

439
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,279
analytical they are logical they might

440
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,000
come across as passive especially in

441
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,520
their communication

442
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,160
but believe me their minds are always

443
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,319
taking away you know they are not big

444
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,119
risk takers but they love detail they

445
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,119
are more doctor they are not optical and

446
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,839
they are sometimes seen as

447
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,559
perfectionists

448
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,319
if you ever say that you are an expert

449
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,919
in something and you're speaking to an

450
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,919
hour but you can't provide evidence or

451
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,839
show that you really know your stuff

452
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,919
then you lose your credibility

453
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,760
immediately

454
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,039
peacocks

455
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,000
yes so they are pretty enthusiastic

456
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,200
creatures

457
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,440
they are passionate they love a good

458
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,080
talk and they like building rapport they

459
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,320
can actually be quite showy as well and

460
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,480
if you ever have a friend that loves to

461
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
talk and enjoy being in a center of

462
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,600
attention

463
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,840
they might be your peacocks

464
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,160
they are relational creatures though so

465
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,039
they will generally do business with

466
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,200
people that they like

467
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,440
i'm sure as i described all these four

468
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,120
buts you are seeing the different

469
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,039
stakeholders or people that you work

470
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,640
with fit into these different

471
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,200
personalities and when you understand

472
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,440
the different personalities that sits on

473
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,160
the board you also recognize and you

474
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,840
know the knowledge and experience that

475
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,120
they bring with them because they also

476
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,679
sit on other boards usually and you'll

477
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,520
be able to tailor your language use and

478
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
also add you know these lenses are

479
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,360
applicable as well when you're dealing

480
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,440
with your executive leadership not just

481
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
the board

482
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,799
another layer in addition to

483
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,679
understanding their personalities is to

484
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,120
understand the motivators of you know

485
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,720
the leaders that you work with and

486
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,000
especially if you want to talk about

487
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,360
presenting to the board you want to make

488
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,039
the most out of your board you need to

489
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,440
understand their drivers what makes them

490
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,600
care you know they care about meeting

491
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,400
the interests of their own stakeholders

492
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
board has to consider the company's

493
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,720
unique characteristics including the

494
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,600
company's size their life cycle stage

495
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,240
business plans industry sectors

496
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,400
geographic footprints culture as well

497
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,039
both also bear the reputational and

498
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,280
financial damage if a breach were to

499
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,039
occur

500
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,520
now in communicating with any

501
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,840
stakeholders whether it is with your

502
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,160
executives or the board you need to

503
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,960
always ask yourselves these two words

504
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,039
so what

505
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,679
what does it mean for the board right in

506
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,240
order to communicate effectively you

507
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,320
know do you know what are some of the

508
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,039
trigger buttons

509
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,679
the legal ramification of a cyber breach

510
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,320
and avoiding fines for the company is a

511
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,000
big factor

512
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,799
there's also some upcoming potential

513
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,360
regulations of board directors you know

514
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,600
being held accountable for cyber

515
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,840
breaches

516
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,240
and boards care about risk to the

517
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,080
business

518
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,880
boards also care about the revenue and

519
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,240
margin

520
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,120
now

521
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,600
although some security initiatives will

522
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,240
improve efficiencies which gives some

523
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,960
value it is generally difficult to

524
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,159
provide an roi return of investment for

525
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,400
cyber security you know to measure

526
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,120
return of risk prevention or return or

527
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,480
protection

528
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,080
so this is why it's really important to

529
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,480
deliver your cyber security risk report

530
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
in terms of the business outcomes that

531
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,360
impact current and future revenue and

532
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,760
margin

533
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,640
you can lead with anticipated business

534
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,960
impact of the system being down you know

535
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,200
this is not a cyber security risk but a

536
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,280
business risk

537
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,960
and how well

538
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,520
is the company managing and mitigating

539
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,559
risk and downside losses while

540
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,880
continuing to ensure profitability and

541
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,320
growth in a very competitive environment

542
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
so votes care about the company's

543
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
prosperity but they also care about

544
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,480
maintaining their social license their

545
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,760
reputation

546
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
you know the boards value the trust that

547
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,600
they have from the public

548
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,200
especially when you talk about large

549
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,120
infrastructure or public companies

550
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,360
hospitals utilities you know colonial

551
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,080
pipelines being just one example

552
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,760
and these things

553
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,360
for example the social license is not

554
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,919
quantifiable

555
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,559
so now applying my so what component

556
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,400
here why is it important to work with

557
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,240
the board

558
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
you know they are able to make real

559
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,200
impact

560
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,799
their role is to bring judgment to

561
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,919
provide effective guidance to management

562
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,080
the cyber security strategy needs to be

563
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,280
led by the board executed by the c-suite

564
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,520
and owned at the front lines of the

565
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,440
organization

566
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,200
so there's hundreds of pages of

567
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,240
documents for board directors but when i

568
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,000
looked when i did my research i speak to

569
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,440
different board directors and after

570
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,919
countless conversations with them

571
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,000
you know if i want to summarize their

572
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,720
top six success criteria that you can

573
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,240
put in a checklist

574
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
there were eight the board in their

575
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,799
cyber literacy thinking it would be this

576
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,600
following six success criteria which

577
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,520
will form the basis of an effective

578
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,120
cyber risk governance of the board

579
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
the first criteria

580
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,200
business ownership so first up the

581
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,120
chairman needs to make sure there's

582
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,200
sufficient time allocated in the board

583
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,799
agenda for cyber risk discussions

584
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,200
you know who owns cyber risk when we

585
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,880
know it is a strategic business enabler

586
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,640
we need to know who's taking ownership

587
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,400
how are we aligning cyber risk

588
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,880
management with the business needs

589
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,039
are you asking the right questions to

590
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,320
ensure cyber risk is woven into business

591
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,520
processes

592
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,679
right from the beginning

593
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,320
has it been baked into a major business

594
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,440
decision

595
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,000
process in a timely fashion you know

596
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,240
take measurement acquisition for example

597
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,600
partnerships and new product launches

598
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,679
we need to approach cyber risk from an

599
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:05,200
enterprise-wide perspective

600
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,600
does the board have oversight of their

601
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,400
capability across detection and response

602
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,960
is our management team able to detect

603
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,760
any cyber attacks and any critical

604
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,159
events that require addressing at a

605
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,240
senior level if an event does occur do

606
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
we have a plan what is it and how

607
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,559
quickly can we recover

608
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,200
second criteria is appropriate

609
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,640
investment are we investing

610
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,919
appropriately

611
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,240
is our current investment and security

612
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,520
budget

613
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,000
into our defense enough

614
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,799
board needs to continuously invest

615
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,960
appropriately in security budget while

616
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,200
being mindful that there's no silver

617
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,279
bullet

618
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,320
and a lot of these things can and will

619
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,200
be resolved by more investment more

620
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,240
controls more automation and more

621
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,799
processes but that still leaves us with

622
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,679
the weak naive and compassionate humans

623
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,520
which is us

624
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,159
so we need to constantly level up in

625
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,480
awareness safeguarding and have

626
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,880
reputation

627
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,919
third criteria rightly equipped are we

628
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,080
rightly equipped in protecting our most

629
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,840
valuable assets

630
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,080
you know we can't forget we need to

631
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
secure our supply chains as well and we

632
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,240
have to pull our suppliers to a good

633
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,200
standard how does organizational design

634
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,120
instruction fair at the moment when it

635
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,039
comes to supporting our cyber security

636
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,039
strategy

637
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,200
how are we incorporating cyber security

638
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,559
expertise into board governance

639
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,120
protection do we have the right tools

640
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,679
process and people including at the

641
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,480
board level itself in place to protect

642
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,240
our boundaries

643
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,480
do we have the access to subject matter

644
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,440
experts to make well-informed decisions

645
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,840
both criteria risk transfer options this

646
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,080
is a simple question if there is no

647
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,600
adequate cyber insurance do we know what

648
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
you know the exposure to the board is

649
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,320
right and if there is do the bot know

650
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,640
what is exactly covered

651
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,120
what are the benefits and does this

652
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,520
effectively align your cyber risk with

653
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,400
the business risk tolerance and if not

654
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,559
other risk other risk transfer options

655
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,840
that can be looked

656
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,400
at fifth criteria maintaining foresight

657
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,080
that is important right how is

658
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,919
organization keeping up with current

659
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,799
affairs and who will be giving top

660
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,880
level sponsorship for upcoming cyber

661
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,120
security related legislation and

662
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,480
regulations

663
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,039
have we tied in future economic drivers

664
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,679
and digital transformation with its

665
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,679
impact on cyber risk

666
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,559
and if so looking into the future how do

667
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,279
we track and respond and budget for all

668
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,960
these new threats

669
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,600
do we understand the legal ramifications

670
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,279
for the company

671
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,240
are we campaigning secure a secure

672
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
culture you know there has never been a

673
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,400
better time to promote and champion

674
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,520
security people are more aware than ever

675
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,919
about securing their personnel and

676
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,039
private information

677
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,480
i had doug richie who hates up cyber

678
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,360
crime

679
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,880
threat response at interpol uh on just

680
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,559
the other day and he really highlights

681
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,159
the importance of a culture that is

682
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,400
beyond the organization and ones that

683
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,600
spend across industry and countries you

684
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
know it's all about an ecosystem and we

685
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,760
need to be sharing intel in order to

686
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,400
strengthen our defenses and resilience

687
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,400
and this brings me to the final criteria

688
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,799
industry resilience right collaboration

689
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,720
is needful for industrial resilience we

690
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,960
can't do it alone are we participating

691
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,480
with other information sharing

692
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,279
organizations and within the ecosystem

693
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,240
itself

694
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,720
are we doing peer review do we know how

695
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,640
we compare with companies in our

696
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,000
industry and similar sizes

697
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
this is my final slide you know you have

698
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,120
succeeded as a cso or cyber risk leader

699
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
if your body is able to say we

700
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,799
understand risk in the context of our

701
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,440
unique business and its objectives

702
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,919
we have confidence that risk is being

703
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,720
managed effectively and that there is a

704
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,600
process in place to continually test

705
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
those assumptions

706
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,159
we have confidence that our security

707
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,440
investment is appropriate to both known

708
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,760
and anticipated risk

709
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,559
we have a high degree of confidence that

710
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,200
we have crisis ready

711
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,679
