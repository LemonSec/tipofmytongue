[Music]

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,840
thank you for the for the introduction

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,480
and so uh i'm brian reed uh i work at

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,559
now secure i have been in mobile and

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,400
security since the blackberry was born

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,600
so that makes me an old mobile dinosaur

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,119
today i'm going to talk about creating

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,960
an iot connected mobile app compliance

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,800
program leveraging the os masvs

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,840
otherwise known as how to take an owasp

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,160
standard and use it to create a new

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,719
certification regime and so we're going

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,559
to talk about that a little bit today

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,559
now

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,840
about 12 hours ago 12 and a half hours

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,160
ago this awesome 20th anniversary event

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,760
kicked off and one of the first

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,200
presentations uh was sven and carlos

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,640
giving us an update on the owasp mobile

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,920
project

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,760
and i'm guessing a decent number of

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,600
people who were here were not up with me

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,640
at 4 00 a.m eastern time this morning

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,640
to go through that and i understand you

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,399
know very much if you're not deeply

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,000
passionate about mobile you may not have

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,959
been there

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,479
but i took the liberty of snapping a

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,159
couple of screenshots on their content i

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,320
have them here and uh for those who know

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,799
the os mobile project the two core

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,560
pillars of the os mobile project are the

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,960
mas vs and the mstg

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,280
a lot of work a ton of work has gone

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,960
into mas vs maturing m-a-s-v-s this

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,159
morning carlos and sven talked about

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,159
updating the mstg

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,520
and so if you're used to the mstg it is

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,320
a less formalized more manual oriented

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,960
document and the process of managing and

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,920
updating the mstg is not quite as well

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,200
organized

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,280
nor is it as automated in the get repo

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,799
as masps

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,479
so they rolled out a new architecture

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,320
this morning uh

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
and so now you can see there's a more

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,479
organized structure here

49
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,280
in terms of creating the mstg and

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,960
updating the mstg

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,640
so looking at it from from both the

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,159
fundamentals and then getting into test

53
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,880
cases uh testing techniques and tools as

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,399
well all in a much more organized

55
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,520
fashion

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,200
so you're going to see this evolve this

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,959
is one of the next big projects that the

58
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,878
team is on going forward

59
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,640
and there was another interesting thing

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,800
they actually had their own now if

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,239
you're a mobile person you know all

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,200
about steve jobs one more thing

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,440
some rebranding is going on so these are

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,920
actually this is the cover art for the

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,879
mesvs and the mstg and some graphical

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,640
updates as you can see from the last

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
slide i showed you as well as this slide

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,959
of some changes there as well and so i

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,239
thought it'd be really great to give

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,640
folks a quick update on the ost mobile

71
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,560
project here before i get barreling into

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,440
my own we started a few minutes early um

73
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,959
and so what i'd like to do now is

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,280
transition into my own content uh if the

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,640
replay is available or you can get your

76
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,879
whole hands on the slides from earlier

77
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,239
this morning i do recommend you have a

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,200
look at it huge thanks uh to carlos and

79
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,599
sven uh for driving the os mobile

80
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,680
project chairing it uh both of them have

81
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,280
been involved for many years and are

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,200
continuing uh with all kinds of

83
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,720
excitement uh to drive it forward so i

84
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,440
want to talk about how an organization

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,920
and how a community can take the 20

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
years of history of owasp and the

87
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,159
maturing processes and documentation of

88
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,120
oas and use it to create new compliance

89
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,480
regimes

90
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,760
and so a couple of years ago a group got

91
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
started about a year year and a half ago

92
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,879
group got started saying we need

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,040
something for mobile connected iot and

94
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,400
vpn

95
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,720
and so a group of us got together and

96
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,920
started working on that i want to share

97
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,120
the story today and it's kind of a

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,319
different kind of perspective that i

99
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,959
think is ideal for really the legacy of

100
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,720
what owasp has created

101
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,040
now just briefly uh as i was introduced

102
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,799
i'm the chief mobility officer what what

103
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,400
the hell does that title mean what that

104
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,239
actually means is i've been doing mobile

105
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,560
longer than my kids have been alive um

106
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,760
and from that perspective whether you

107
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,360
look at blackberry which is the original

108
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,879
mobile security company all the way

109
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,159
through to where we are with ios and

110
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,159
android today it's been really quite a

111
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,840
journey and i've been very excited to be

112
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,360
in in the core of many of the businesses

113
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,360
that have driven that and partnered with

114
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,480
apple and google and the other

115
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,400
organizations along the way uh my

116
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,319
particular company uh we're actually the

117
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,400
the lead financial sponsor and have been

118
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
since the inception of the oauth mobile

119
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,000
project we also participate in creating

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
tools the os mobile project involving

121
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,959
the me svs and the mstg uh if you know

122
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,040
frida and radari sort of the world's top

123
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,199
reversing and disassembly tools uh the

124
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,880
research teams that created frida and

125
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,240
radari are

126
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,560
members of our organization frida and

127
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,040
oola and pancake for example

128
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,720
if you know them we work with a lot of

129
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,320
kind of who's who so if you need help

130
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,880
with mobile appsec clearly uh mobile is

131
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
here for us now to kind of tee this up

132
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
we spend so much time uh

133
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,160
many times thinking about uh the the

134
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
world economy driven on web apps but the

135
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,800
reality is that 69 of all digital time

136
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,560
and traffic now actually is mobile apps

137
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,479
and mobile apps now dominate usage in

138
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,840
the marketplace

139
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,400
there were actually 130 billion apps

140
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,479
downloaded during the pandemic last year

141
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,800
alone and it drives billions in economic

142
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
value and so

143
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
mobile is there and much like you know

144
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,280
15

145
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,039
14 13 years ago when the mobile project

146
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,240
got started you know the reality is that

147
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,560
85 percent of all the apps we test and

148
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,440
in fact 85 of the millions of apps in

149
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,800
the apple app store in the google play

150
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,960
store have security vulnerabilities you

151
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,160
know in the web world we talk about

152
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,919
cross-site scripting well in the mobile

153
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,919
world insecure network connections and

154
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,160
insecure data storage dominate and in

155
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,919
fact 70 of those leak private data as

156
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,240
well and so the the the

157
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,880
security issues for mobile apps are as

158
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,080
big or more and as prevalent or more as

159
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,520
they are in the web world and that's why

160
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
the oauth mobile project got started and

161
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
that's why so many of us are investing

162
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,759
in evolving that project

163
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,600
now if you've done pen testing in mobile

164
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
or you've dug into some of those scary

165
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,759
stats what you find is about half of

166
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,160
mobile apps have insecure data storage

167
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,199
48

168
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,880
leaked data over the network and secure

169
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,400
networking the good news is most of them

170
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,600
are good at authentication and

171
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,080
authorization um and about 47 of

172
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,919
exploitable extraneous functionality

173
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,840
that shouldn't be there right so those

174
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,280
are some pretty bad stats we do

175
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,600
benchmark uh and analyze the app stores

176
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,120
i'll give you a link to get the

177
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,880
benchmark analytics at the end here if

178
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,880
you want to see it but the reality is

179
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,479
that much like we all talk about

180
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,160
cross-site scripting as being an example

181
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,639
for web the prevalence is there

182
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,800
so last year a group of us got started

183
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,720
with an organization called ioxt looking

184
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,400
at iot connected mobile apps and uh last

185
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,080
uh three years ago

186
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,919
an organization called ixt created a

187
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,319
standard for certifying uh the security

188
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,880
of iot devices and started thinking

189
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,560
about what happens with mobile apps and

190
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,199
if you if you sub dumpster dive into

191
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,520
looking at uh mobile connected apps so

192
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,880
those are apps that talk to things in

193
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,039
your house those are apps that talk to

194
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,160
irobot or talk to your car like ford or

195
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,960
tesla or talk to industrial production

196
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,720
equipment hvac in your building what

197
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,039
have you uh so both industrial consumer

198
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,880
apps and many different kinds of things

199
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,039
what you find is they're pretty bad too

200
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,960
and so while we're scared about we're

201
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,360
concerned about uh and we're starting to

202
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,840
to publicize about issues of iot devices

203
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,919
being insecure the reality is mobile

204
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,520
apps are insecure too and those mobile

205
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,880
apps that connect to them are often the

206
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,440
breach uh language angles and so in

207
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,319
benchmarking about 250 270 the most

208
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,680
prevalent common apps we found about 87

209
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,599
had data storage issues encryption

210
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,840
issues and so on and so forth some did a

211
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,199
really great job with credentials which

212
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,199
was awesome and authentication again so

213
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,639
those sides are being addressed pretty

214
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,560
well there's a link to this benchmark

215
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,240
you can see that you'll be able to go to

216
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,720
afterwards to kind of understand it

217
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,400
so what do we do about this so ioxt

218
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,560
formed over five years ago uh it's

219
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,039
really the who's who of all of the iot

220
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,880
device manufacturers you have google and

221
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,479
amazon and things like ring doorbell in

222
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,000
there uh sonus and and uh

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,720
numerous consumer and industrial uh iot

224
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,120
organizations are part of it and it's a

225
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,479
standards body that created a

226
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,639
certification regime

227
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,680
for uh iot things and they've done

228
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,199
certification regimes for a number of

229
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,879
other things but they're they're started

230
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,639
with founded on uh

231
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,440
iot device certification so a group of

232
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,759
us google amazon now secure ncc group

233
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,440
seven layers and durka

234
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,360
with a handful of others in review got

235
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,199
together and said hey what can we do

236
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,080
about creating a certification regime

237
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,280
for uh mobile apps that connect to iot

238
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,199
devices and while we're at it some

239
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,280
members of the vpn community joined as

240
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,879
well and we said okay so mobile apps and

241
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,479
mobile vpns

242
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,319
what can we do about that

243
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,080
and so the group got together and got

244
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,760
started on a project and i'm going to

245
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,799
take you through the story of the

246
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,039
project so what was the objective well

247
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,120
the objective was to create a reasonable

248
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,479
reliable

249
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,640
industry standard to build test and

250
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,919
certify

251
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,519
the security of mobile apps that connect

252
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,320
to

253
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
uh directly to

254
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,600
or through cloud services to iot things

255
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,000
and vpns and i think the key word here

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,800
is certify right so there are existing

257
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,720
standards like oasp on how to build and

258
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,040
test but there is no publicly available

259
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
and publicly agreed to

260
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,720
certification regime

261
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
and because io xt was having a lot of

262
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,040
success with certifying the security of

263
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,880
devices they thought it would be logical

264
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,399
to then extend that to things that

265
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,080
connect the devices which are mobile

266
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,320
apps and other things

267
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,080
and so we got together started working

268
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,160
through this and with many of the device

269
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,000
vendors right here with for example

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,839
google and amazon

271
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,600
and so you know the first series of

272
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,279
brainstorming sessions were well should

273
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,200
we build this from scratch

274
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,560
right and i don't know how many of you

275
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,399
have ever been as part of coming up with

276
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,160
a new idea but for some reason most of

277
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,600
the time we tend to start with well

278
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
let's build from scratch

279
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,800
right and you start putting ideas on the

280
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,080
board and you start thinking through the

281
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,680
semantics of it and you think about you

282
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,959
know where's the edge of the envelope

283
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,240
and all the rest

284
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,480
and that kind of after a meeting or two

285
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,880
moved pretty quickly into well maybe

286
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,720
it'd be better if we started with some

287
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,959
existing standards or regulations so we

288
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,640
went over to europe we looked at the iso

289
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,560
stuff we looked at cis

290
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,240
here in the states we looked at nist and

291
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,959
we looked at owasp and in doing all of

292
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,279
this there were pros and cons for you

293
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,800
know leveraging the different regimes

294
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,839
and you know depending on your

295
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,680
organization for example you might be

296
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,920
you know using the the the mitre attack

297
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,440
framework or some of the nist standards

298
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,640
or the iso standards in your

299
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,279
organization as a

300
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,760
security framework overall

301
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,600
to protect your enterprise

302
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,000
and so going through it it became really

303
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,480
pretty clear pretty quickly

304
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,040
that os was the place to go and mas vs

305
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,200
was the real foundation for us to take

306
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,279
what mas vs was

307
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,920
make extensions or modifications to it

308
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,880
for what's relevant to io xt or excuse

309
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,959
me what's relevant to iot devices and

310
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,720
vpns

311
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,279
and extend it into a certification

312
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,480
regime uh beyond a security standard and

313
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,920
testing regime

314
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,480
and you know we and and we who are

315
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,920
sponsored the mobile project and very

316
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,320
deep in it uh our friends at google who

317
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,720
are huge on leveraging standards uh in

318
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,399
oasp and some of the others said that's

319
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,480
absolutely the way to go here we go

320
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,240
now as we started merging in the vpn

321
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,839
stuff we grabbed some some core

322
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,760
components from the vpn trust initiative

323
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,880
as well

324
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,160
and so what i'd like to do is kind of

325
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,640
walk you through how we went about doing

326
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,320
this so first we took a look at the

327
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,959
oauth project resources and clearly the

328
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,360
masvs and the mstg are the core it's

329
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,200
evolved a lot since the os mobile top

330
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,079
10.

331
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,160
so we started digging into that right

332
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
and if you've been through the masvs and

333
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,920
you've been through the mstg you'll be

334
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,720
familiar with some of these things so uh

335
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,560
owasp the masvs

336
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,720
the project team recognized in the os

337
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,800
mobile project that really there were

338
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,200
four levels and categories right so we

339
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,160
had this this basic l1 which is a

340
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,959
standard level of security that meets a

341
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:43,920
certain

342
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
we'll call it a low threat model

343
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,200
threshold

344
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,519
and then l2 is this idea of defense and

345
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,240
depth so if i have regulated data if i

346
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,399
have compliance

347
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,560
and so forth you know that's more than

348
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,399
than a simple app so you know simple

349
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,120
masbs l1 security standard app might be

350
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,000
like a book a conference room app

351
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,360
right and uh uh or look up a map of a

352
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,680
building the level two might be book a

353
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,200
conference room

354
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,560
um but now when you get into something

355
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,399
like a financial app or maybe you get

356
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,240
into a mobile connected app where the

357
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,480
mobile app is a a blood pressure or a

358
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,399
blood uh

359
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,800
insulin injector type of thing you need

360
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,399
resilience

361
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,800
and so the the l1 plus r and l2 plus r

362
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,120
was really looking at it resiliency with

363
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,839
the idea of a self-defending application

364
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,480
so if i'm l1 i'm at a lower level but i

365
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
have some ip protection and maybe some

366
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,800
some malicious modification a from l2

367
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,560
plus r now you're into doing complex

368
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,040
activities with sensitive data and where

369
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,720
uh sensitive data and ip protection

370
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,480
really are critical so think of your

371
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,120
classic banking app think of the app

372
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,760
that drives industrial machinery or

373
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,480
manages and maintains an airplane right

374
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
those kinds of things need the highest

375
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,880
level which is l2 plus r

376
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,639
and so working through the msvs levels

377
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,000
we're like okay we need a leveling

378
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,519
system we need to think about resiliency

379
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,680
we need to think about a structure to

380
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,040
that

381
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
further we looked into the domain so

382
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,959
masbs has eight domains that's right and

383
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,320
so we're looking at everything from

384
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,839
architecture and threat modeling all the

385
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,079
way through data storage uh into

386
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,560
cryptography into authentication and

387
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,320
session management into the network

388
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,279
layer

389
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,959
environmental interactions right there's

390
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,639
some unique characteristics of a mobile

391
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,279
device versus a laptop or a web web

392
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,320
environment

393
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
uh everyone needs to worry about code

394
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,760
quality and then obviously there's that

395
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,920
resiliency the the plus r here that we

396
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,000
talked about earlier now if you remember

397
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,959
my stats earlier basically data storage

398
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,040
and network communications are a train

399
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,720
wreck in mobile

400
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,079
and so we needed to think about that as

401
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,399
we got into the mobile connected iot and

402
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,560
mobile vpn side of the house you may

403
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,079
also remember that authentication and

404
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,519
session management were actually pretty

405
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,560
good

406
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,480
from that perspective as well

407
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,680
and so we're working our way through

408
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,120
this we're looking at those benchmarks

409
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
in the analytics of

410
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,959
analyzing the mass scale of iot

411
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,199
connected apps and vpn mobile apps and

412
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,279
things like that and so we said okay

413
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,920
let's create a regime now that will meet

414
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,639
our our requirements so within io xt

415
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,959
there was already a structure within mas

416
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,639
vs there was already a structure who

417
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,279
wanted to harmonize uh and bring all of

418
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,199
that together which is what you'll see

419
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,360
here in the picture

420
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,160
and so we settled on while masbs had you

421
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,240
know over 80 requirements we settled on

422
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,560
30 key requirements that are truly

423
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,600
relevant

424
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,959
to an iot and a vpn world and organize

425
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,040
them across eight pledge categories now

426
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,480
some of the pledge categories i'm going

427
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,320
to show you in a minute are the same as

428
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,480
what's in masbs and some are different

429
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,519
right because they're more relevant to

430
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,079
certification

431
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,800
oriented regimes that are beyond uh

432
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,639
traditional security

433
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,160
requirements

434
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,480
now one of the core characteristics here

435
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,920
was recognizing that if you're going to

436
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,720
have a certification regime it's very

437
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,440
brutal if you force everybody to meet a

438
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,800
common bar

439
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,279
the reality is in many ways a number of

440
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,199
other types of certification regimes

441
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,959
enable different levels so you can be

442
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,959
sort of lightly certified versus middle

443
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,360
certified versus deeply or heavily

444
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,639
certified

445
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,720
and so what we did is created this

446
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,040
ability to have different levels and

447
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,880
those mandatory levels that's that

448
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,120
minimum bar that everybody has to meet

449
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,440
but the optional levels really enable

450
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,760
organizations to choose right so as a

451
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,959
developer

452
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,880
in building a new mobile connected iot

453
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,279
app i can choose whether i want to be

454
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,199
highly differentiated by providing a

455
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,199
super high level

456
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,279
of certification or maybe a lower level

457
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,959
of certification for a lower bar maybe

458
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,399
have a more economical or cheaper

459
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,079
product maybe i charge a premium for the

460
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,480
higher level and then for the consumer

461
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,759
for the consumer that gives them

462
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,759
transparency oh this is a level one or

463
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,759
two or three right depending on which

464
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,600
level now i understand what minimum bar

465
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,360
they meet and so it's really great for

466
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,880
both the consumer and the vendor having

467
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,680
this levels of differentiation

468
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,920
now in order to to be successful what we

469
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,880
learned from iot device certification is

470
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,560
really need to establish some policy

471
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,639
requirements not just security

472
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,320
requirements and we'll show you those in

473
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,920
a second

474
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,360
and as part of that then as i mentioned

475
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,800
before having this notion of minimum

476
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,360
certification requirements and so when

477
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,000
we think about mas and mstg

478
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,839
organizations use them as a testing

479
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,160
regime but there's no there's no like

480
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
public mechanism or

481
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,800
or standard way to say hey i passed

482
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,120
these components of mstg that makes me

483
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,759
this sort of certified vendor according

484
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,920
to owasp that's not the premise of owasp

485
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,399
is to certify people but the premise of

486
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,120
the ioxt world is to certify people so

487
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,920
we we build on masvs and mstg and we

488
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,360
actually create certification

489
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,959
requirements and then of course there

490
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,079
are some things that are kind of unique

491
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,240
to iot and vpn we wanted to make sure

492
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,000
that the right elements were in there

493
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,160
sometimes those are subdescriptors or

494
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,079
test case scenarios that are specific to

495
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,000
something related to iot or vpn that

496
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,240
maybe doesn't exist in the broader world

497
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,759
of more general

498
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,519
applications

499
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,199
so i'd like to show you what this looks

500
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,079
like

501
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,319
so uh first we have the application

502
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,480
profile that was created and it's a

503
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,679
simple uh

504
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,000
19-page document uh very simple uh

505
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,679
compared to the thickness of mas and

506
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,599
mstg however

507
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,919
inside it's footnoted everywhere with

508
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,079
links and credits back to the masvs and

509
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,679
the mstg

510
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,599
so along with the application profile we

511
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,160
have a compliance test case library

512
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,400
so basically like there's an mas vs an

513
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,320
mstg there's the profile and there's the

514
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,400
test case library and inside the test

515
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,840
case library there are references to the

516
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,919
mstg much like they're inside the

517
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,039
profile there's references to the masbs

518
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,039
so as we jump into this here you can see

519
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,440
very specifically in the in the test uh

520
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
in the testing guide here on the left

521
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,160
we're at uh up103 so authentication of

522
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,240
remote services and you'll see the

523
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,679
description of how to test and what are

524
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,360
the requirements for uh building and

525
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,280
testing the application and all the

526
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,440
footnotes link back to something in the

527
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,520
masves for almost everything in the ms

528
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,840
in the testing guide here for io xt

529
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,480
there is a link back to the masvs or the

530
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,679
mstg as a source or reference point for

531
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,760
more information and so we found this

532
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,840
very certain synergistic pattern means

533
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,160
that any development team using the mas

534
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,799
ps and any any um testing team using the

535
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,320
mstg can very easily move into and take

536
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,600
advantage of iot certification because

537
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,240
there's such a commonality between the

538
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
two they just need to adapt to some of

539
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,600
the unique differences that i'll show

540
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,760
you as well

541
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,400
so much like the os beme svs has uh the

542
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,840
four boxes here we have the mobile

543
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
application profile there are actually

544
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,039
uh eight sections at the bottom uh and

545
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,960
as you can see in each one

546
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,600
um there is a stack diagram that

547
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,919
basically represents different levels

548
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,480
and so the levels uh escalate as you go

549
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,919
up so deeper and deeper or more

550
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,000
sophisticated requirements higher degree

551
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,160
of certificate security certification

552
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,880
occurs as you move up uh in each of

553
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,799
these sections and then within each

554
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,160
section you're going to notice some

555
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,080
things as well so i'm going to kind of

556
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,679
peel this apart

557
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,360
so in my build here the first thing

558
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,200
we're going to see in the build here is

559
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,520
uh to go in the top right we have the

560
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,880
required

561
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,840
yellow arrow and so as you look through

562
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,960
each section there are minimum required

563
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,440
standards to achieve

564
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,200
io xt certification

565
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,520
so for example if i look at the secured

566
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,000
interfaces you can see that uh

567
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,320
si1 and si2 si110

568
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,880
111 and 112. those are all required

569
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,440
now the level one two three four five is

570
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,760
based on some core io xt standards and

571
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,120
certification levels uh so the the red

572
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,440
excuse me the sort of pink fuchsia

573
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,480
blue gray orange mapping maps across

574
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,200
other types of ioxt certifications and

575
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,559
then as you level up you've got the

576
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,720
masbs items pulled over and so you can

577
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,039
see for example for secured interfaces

578
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,799
that you actually have to have all the

579
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,600
way up to that bar now that's minimum

580
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,440
required certification now if i want to

581
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,000
enforce uh if i want to achieve the

582
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,640
higher level the level 4 certification

583
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,679
then that means i need to incorporate si

584
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,960
113 which is basically enforcing x 509

585
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,080
certificates

586
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,840
and so we can walk our way across this

587
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,240
from a password level through

588
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,600
cryptography to security by default to

589
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,360
verified software automatic software

590
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
updates vulnerability reporting and

591
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
security exploration we can see that

592
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,640
there's varying levels of requirements

593
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,360
uh within uh each of these and those

594
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,240
varying level of requirements are again

595
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,320
getting to minimum requirements that

596
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,559
then are predictable and consistent uh

597
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,280
for the audience now as we dive into

598
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,880
this there's another area of unique

599
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,400
additions and that's really around

600
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,760
policy

601
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,280
and so some of the things we have

602
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,520
experienced around the ioxt side and

603
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,000
experience around the sort of lack in in

604
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,280
owasp from masvs or around these so

605
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,600
verified software right so is there

606
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,440
something that actually verifies and

607
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,520
certifies that anti-rollback is in there

608
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,000
that proven cryptography is in there uh

609
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,080
that images are signed and verified and

610
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,320
so on and so forth so verified software

611
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,440
is an excellent policy uh for true in a

612
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,280
certification regime

613
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,799
vulnerability reporting is also

614
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,559
important um so do you have a public

615
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,640
disclosure program right do you have it

616
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,880
in place are you running a bug bounty

617
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
program are you monitoring for it can

618
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,480
you prove that you're monitoring for it

619
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,640
uh and so on and so forth and we believe

620
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,039
in responsible disclosure we do it a lot

621
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,200
to help organizations and this is

622
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
important really to have an effective

623
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,640
program

624
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
and then expiration date is also very

625
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,760
important so if you think about a

626
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,440
physical device like if i have a thing

627
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,919
it's got a fixed chip set in it i may or

628
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,679
may not be able to update that firmware

629
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,240
and technology moves so fast that the

630
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,720
reality is you should have a security

631
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,039
expiration on that and and we should

632
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,799
think about it that's a software level

633
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,679
for applications as well and so security

634
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,760
expiration date is a key difference

635
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,720
between osp uh and io xt but it's an

636
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,240
important difference because that's

637
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,159
really enabling organizations to

638
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,880
understand how long can i trust this

639
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,320
based on the velocity of the market

640
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,159
based on the standard that i use based

641
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,039
on the certification level that i have

642
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,039
and that really forces the upgrade

643
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,480
cycles that we all know are so

644
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,360
critically important and enabling people

645
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,799
or not including them means that a

646
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,320
potential set of vulnerabilities could

647
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,880
be introduced or the opportunity for

648
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,760
risk is is escalated if i don't actually

649
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,240
have a regime that expires so that was

650
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,240
an important addition as well

651
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,400
uh as we built this all out

652
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,320
and so we're really excited now because

653
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,840
here we are and there's some uh 50 uh

654
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,720
mobile applications and vpns that have

655
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,919
been certified uh by now secure but also

656
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,039
there's over 200 have been certified i

657
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,440
failed to mention before that the

658
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,640
the io xt mobile application profile

659
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,440
regime was announced february of this

660
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,880
year so february of 2021 and so in the

661
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
first six or seven months we've had

662
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,840
hundreds

663
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,720
of mobile connected iot application

664
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,000
vendors

665
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,640
as well as vpn vendors come through the

666
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,799
certification process

667
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,400
and achieved certification so it is

668
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,320
working very well

669
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,400
it's also been very interesting when we

670
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,840
look at some of these policy levels

671
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,679
remember we said that the

672
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,520
notion of required

673
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,760
allowed organizations to meet a certain

674
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,360
minimum bar but organizations could

675
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,640
differentiate

676
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,080
and it's been interesting watching the

677
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,159
vpn vendors for example

678
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,400
some of the vpn vendors who only met the

679
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
minimum level recognized their

680
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,480
competitors were achieving level three

681
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,880
or four and so from a competitive

682
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
differentiation perspective they found

683
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,279
themselves at a competitive disadvantage

684
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,799
and so the regime worked because the

685
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,080
buyer community could see the

686
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,159
differences in certification between vpn

687
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,240
vendors and some of those vpn vendors

688
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,559
went back improved their products and

689
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,320
then came back and got the higher level

690
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,919
of certification

691
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,760
and so when we think back to the mission

692
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,080
of owasp and the use of owasp as a

693
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,159
really guiding principle from mobile

694
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,159
application developers and for mobile

695
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,360
application security testing

696
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,640
professionals the ioxt certification

697
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,440
creates a new layer or a new layer of

698
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,279
value on top of what we were already

699
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,240
doing adding that compliance compliance

700
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,880
layer and that compliance regime to it

701
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,400
which actually really helps drive the

702
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,279
market

703
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,640
and so while development teams are

704
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,000
working better and security testing

705
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,679
teams are working better now we have an

706
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,120
ability to

707
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,440
apply certifications to them

708
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,520
for the public marketplace we see this

709
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,120
working really well

710
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,080
for iot connected devices and vpns we

711
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,320
see this going many other places until

712
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,240
we kind of think about the evolution now

713
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,080
masvs and

714
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,000
mstg and the os mobile project they're

715
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,080
barreling down the path they're very

716
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,000
mature but as i showed earlier at the

717
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,919
beginning we're working on some tune-ups

718
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,520
for the mstg we're working on more

719
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,440
tooling we're working more education and

720
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,279
all those great things

721
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,799
and now it's it's mature enough that

722
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,720
you're able to build certification

723
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,200
regimes on top of it like the ioxt

724
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,279
mobile application profile

725
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,120
uh and where is it going well there's

726
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,520
some interesting work going on with etsy

727
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,279
uh and it's e3o en 303 645 um and so

728
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,159
there's some uh opportunity here to to

729
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,720
build on what ioxt has done with the

730
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,039
mobile application profile and uh

731
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,799
testing certification with what etsy's

732
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,840
doing uh and we see a good opportunity

733
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,960
for those two to compound together uh

734
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,720
and grow things to the next level as

735
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,120
well and so if uh if you're attending

736
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
this session today uh because you are an

737
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,200
iot or the vpn world and you've been

738
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,520
watching or participating in ioxt uh

739
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,760
come join us also with the etsy group a

740
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,120
lot of ios team members are

741
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,960
participating with etsy as well

742
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,480
and there's likely congruence that's

743
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,240
going to happen as these these come

744
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,279
together

745
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,520
uh organizationally and structurally

746
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,679
so really it's osp you know tell us for

747
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,960
the win

748
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,640
from this perspective again i've been

749
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,159
doing standards going all the way back

750
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,880
to ansi and iso uh back before i had

751
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,200
gray hair uh in the late 80s and early

752
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,600
90s i was in the nc sql standards bodies

753
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,240
for 89 and 91 i have worked with other

754
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,919
standards groups uh over the year a lot

755
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,520
of standards related to blackberry in

756
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,440
the early days and now owasp in the last

757
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,600
decade uh and i'm really excited to see

758
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,559
how well owasp was matured listening to

759
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,400
you know andrew vanderstark and and the

760
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,640
other founders of marcus just before me

761
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,279
um it's amazing evolution uh here and

762
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,279
now we have certification regimes and

763
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,159
expanded standards being built on uh os

764
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,919
which has become the core standards for

765
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,520
the world so we're very excited about

766
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,320
that

767
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,480

come participate in those projects as

774
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,559
well uh now secure does a number of

775
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,720
crack knees uh along with spec work so

776
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,120
we recently uh as part of our two con

777
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,400
last year

778
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,080
a group at r2 got together and created

779
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,320
an android crack me uh so if you're

780
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,600
working your way through developing your

781
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,159
skills and the oos suite you can go into

782
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,240
the os acme

783
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,760
crack me and download it and have some

784
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,520
fun with that as well uh the r2

785
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,640
community continues to work

786
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,480
collaboratively with with the owasp

787
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,520
community

788
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,600
um i talked about some of the benchmarks

789
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,720
earlier so there's a couple of

790
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,360
benchmarks here so uh um the big one is

791
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,679
in the middle the app store risk tracker

792
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,600
so that is analyzing the millions of

793
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,880
apps in the app store and giving

794
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,960
aggregated data around security risks

795
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,840
and privacy issues no we're not outing

796
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,600
any individual vendors but all the

797
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,960
vendors you know that are top

798
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,520
manufacturers and 15 verticals are there

799

that can be give you some more

800
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,559
background on what's going on and give

801
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,360
you a path to uh testing yourself

you on the journey of you know 20 years

826
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,760
of a wasp has led to now certification

827
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,159
regime uh where ioct has been able to

828
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,440
leverage the osp masbs and mstg to turn

829
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,600
it into a certification and testing

830
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,960
regime uh for iot connected mobile apps

831
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
and for vpns and we're super excited
