2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,480
now that i'm between a bunch of people

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,040
in their weekend

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,920
i have story time

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,680
essentially so you had andrew

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,680
vanderstalk talked with you all a little

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,439
bit earlier today

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,920
and gave you a bit of an overview of the

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,119
top ten

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,240
and my job today is task to give you an

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,800
idea of how we got to the top 10.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,680
so

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,600
bear with me this has a

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,600
let's say

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
several hundred hours over the last year

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,440
condensed into about 25 minutes

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,640
so we will have to give you some stories

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,000
so first i would like to

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,800
actually thank hugo

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,559
costa

21
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,680
the iconography for the top 10 for this

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,960
20th anniversary is amazing um for the

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,799
first time we actually get to provide

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,000
our own icons for the top 10

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and i i love them

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,360
i think they're really good and they'll

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,000
help us carry the message through

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,840
so the question is how how did we get

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,960
here

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,920
and it's a uh it took us a while it's a

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,200
long journey

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,439
um i won't give you all the details you

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,040
don't have time for that

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,000
but i will get you an idea of what it

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,159
took for us to get through this

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,000
so one of the things like jeff williams

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
mentioned earlier

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,079
was one of the biggest things we can do

39
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,759
to improve security is have transparency

40
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,759
and so one of the things we wanted to do

41
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,399
was be able to share how we got

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,280
to what we picked as the top 10 risk

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,200
categories in the top 10

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,759
for 2021.

45
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,840
so as we went through building it we had

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,920
these core principles so one thing we

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,759
had to remember is the top 10 is a

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,560
baseline it's not a ceiling

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200
so not everything has to be in it

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,520
but at the same time we also realize

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
that over the years some people don't go

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,560
past the top 10. so we need to make sure

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
that it's good it's actionable and it

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,360
has good solid coverage

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,920
data is good but it's not everything

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,000
the data that we look at is looking in

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,480
the past so it is not necessarily

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,319
representative of today

59
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,280
it is what we managed to figure out

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,560
potentially

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,280
weeks months or even years in the past

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
so that's part of the reason why we use

63
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,280
a community survey as well because there

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,480
is a lag between when humans figure out

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,680
we have a particular type of

66
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,959
vulnerability

67
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,040
to where they can reliably test for it

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,640
to when they can build it into

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,879
automation to when automation runs at

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,560
enough scale that it shows up in the

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,040
data

72
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,480
the other core principle we have is

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,560
stability is good

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,879
so some people have asked us why the top

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,720
ten only updates every three to four

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,840
years

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,879
and

78
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,720
one of the things that we understand

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,879
with the top 10 that is incredibly

80
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,120
humbling and we take incredibly

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,560
seriously

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,200
is that whatever we pick

83
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,000
for these top 10 risk categories is

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
going to start in motion

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
10 to hundreds of thousands of hours of

86
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,319
labor over the next some odd years

87
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,879
this is not something we take lightly

88
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,360
and it's also something that why we

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,239
don't update it on an annual basis or

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,959
even update it live because could you

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,760
imagine trying to build training content

92
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,799
or dro build standards or build

93
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,959
tools or build anything against the top

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,239
10 and it never stops changing

95
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,640
so if we change it too often people will

96
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,760
basically quit using it because there is

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
a point and there is a place for things

98
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,040
that change

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,159
quite frequently or just continuously

100
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,000
but there is also a place for things

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,720
that

102
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,519
provide foundational stability for other

103
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,840
people to build on

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
the other principle we have is raise

105
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
minimum bar

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,560
so we need to our goal is in this

107
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,040
position of this project is to raise

108
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,519
that bar

109
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,120
we need to further

110
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,279
improving security across the industry

111
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,199
across the community and if we don't

112
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,960
raise the bar then

113
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,120
who is

114
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,720
we also want to make sure we drive the

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
right behavior we don't want to drive

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
pure compliance behavior we don't want

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,320
to drive checkbox behavior we want to

118
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,240
drive behavior that actually improves

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,120
software security across the industry

120
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,080
and one other that we thought about

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,320
this year around that came up was

122
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,800
looking at root cause over symptom

123
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,240
and i'll talk a little bit more about

124
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,639
that as we go through this

125
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,639
but one other thing i wanted to show you

126
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,840
is

127
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,680
i also work on the software assurance

128
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
maturity model life cycle or the

129
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
software assurance maturity model or

130
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,880
oauth sam

131
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,199
and to give you an idea of the size of

132
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,080
scope or scale between these two so this

133
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,360
is a blown up image of sam

134
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
that i put together at one point so

135
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,479
typically the top 10 fits here

136
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,000
the top 10 might fit in software

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,280
requirements might fit in dependencies

138
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,479
um

139
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,120
and it comes in the test cases

140
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,440
so of the direct impact it's usually in

141
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,800
those places

142
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,639
it gets used sometimes in policy and

143
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,400
standards it gets used in training and

144
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,919
awareness

145
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,199
with the recent updates to 2021 we also

146
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,479
now have a say in

147
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,080
where you need to help improve your

148
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,400
deployment process a little bit of

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,880
secret management build process

150
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,039
and with the addition of a4 insecure

151
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,280
design now we're touching a little bit

152
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,280
on architectural design and threat

153
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,919
modeling app risk profiling but at the

154
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,160
end of the day we still within the top

155
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,639
10 itself touch a fraction

156
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,680
of how broad secure software security

157
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,840
actually is

158
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,319
so please understand this is a starting

159
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,560
point

160
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,960
so as we look at how what we did for

161
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,000
data

162
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,639
i have to stop and just say thank you

163
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,520
because without these 12 organizations

164
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,400
who put out volunteer hours

165
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,280
to gather data to organize it to send it

166
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,600
to me to answer my questions about their

167
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
data to respond some more

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,759
and then a 13th anonymous donor

169
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,759
thank you so much this is the largest

170
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,080
data set we've ever had related to this

171
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
kind of information

172
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,600
and there's so much more to glean from

173
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,000
it beyond just what we used for the top

174
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,840
ten so it's something that i look

175
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,520
forward to being able to dig through for

176
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,199
the next few years

177
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,520
but i need to say thank you because if

178
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,840
you all had not contributed this data

179
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,240
then your top 10 will be subject to our

180
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,160
whims on whatever we felt like at the

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,400
time

182
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,520
so with the data so we're continuing

183
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,800
what we did with 2017 so in 2017 we

184
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,440
switched over from incidence rate we

185
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
switched over from frequency to

186
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,880
incidence rate

187
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,680
so frequency is not really a good way to

188
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,639
measure impacts to a population so

189
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,599
incidence rate more comes from

190
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:18,880
epidemiology where you're looking at

191
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,520
what percentage of the population was

192
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,599
affected by something in a given time

193
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,360
period

194
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,919
the other thing we changed or one of the

195
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,479
things we changed in 2021

196
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,440
was

197
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,720
we kind of opened the floodgates for cwe

198
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,880
map data so in 2017 it was the original

199
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,759
data call prescribed between 30 and 35

200
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,280
cwes

201
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
and we asked organizations send us what

202
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,000
you have related to these cwes that we

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,759
prescribed for you

204
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
versus in 2021 we said send us

205
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,479
everything you find

206
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,800
whatever you map stuff to

207
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,240
send it to us and we'll deal with it

208
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
so a minimum level data request that we

209
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,840
asked for is we said please send us a

210
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,879
year

211
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,840
please send us what cwe you tested for

212
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,080
please tell us the population that you

213
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
tested how many applications were tested

214
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,759
for the cwe

215
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,440
and then how many apps were found to

216
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,680
have at least one instance

217
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,479
so again if you had 4 000 instances of

218
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,639
cross-site scripting in the app i want a

219
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,080
one one app

220
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,919
helps us understand like what percentage

221
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,440
of the population

222
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,599
was actually impacted by types of

223
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,279
vulnerabilities it does not tell us

224
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,039
whether or not the vulnerability was a

225
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,919
systemic issue or a one-off but in our

226
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,360
case for

227
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,000
the top 10 it that's not a big deal we

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,440
don't really need to know that type of

229
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,839
information

230
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,600
so we ran into an interesting thing when

231
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,399
we got cwe's from organizations

232
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,120
so on this bottom we have

233
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,800
13 organizations so only one cwe did all

234
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,720
13 organizations tell us they actually

235
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,399
tested for

236
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,279
only one cwe did 10 organizations test

237
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,880
form

238
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,720
so this is the part where i really

239
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,000
really wish i was actually in front of

240
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,519
the audience because then i could ask

241
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,200
you this question and you all could yell

242
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,040
it back at me

243
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,080
but what do you think the number one cwe

244
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
tested for was

245
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,959
so that's cwe 79

246
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,519
and if you pay if you've dug in the cwes

247
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,880
before cwe 79 is you guessed it

248
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
cross-site scripting

249
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,600
shocker right

250
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
the second one is actually cwe 200. now

251
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,080
cwe 200 isn't quite as well known by

252
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,320
people um at least not in terms of we

253
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
memorized its number

254
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,440
and it's exposure of sensitive

255
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,760
information to unauthorized

256
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,040
attacker

257
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,399
so the interesting thing is with cwe 200

258
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,399
and this is the say this gets me back to

259
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,600
that point of root cause versus symptom

260
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,360
cwe 200 doesn't tell me why

261
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,160
it says hey you coughed up sensitive

262
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,920
data to somebody who wasn't authorized

263
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,880
to see it

264
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,800
but doesn't tell me

265
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,640
why that happened it doesn't tell me

266
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,160
that there was a lack of a control it

267
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,519
doesn't tell me if there's a broken

268
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,920
control it doesn't tell me what caused

269
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,279
it it just told me what happened

270
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,120
so it's an interesting challenge as we

271
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,279
walk through trying to figure out root

272
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,360
cause versus symptom

273
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,839
in terms of some of the cwe's or symptom

274
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,440
as well not all of them are root cause

275
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,240
so for number three or for three of them

276
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,079
we have 327

277
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,160
which is a use of broken or risky

278
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,640
cryptographic algorithm 89 which

279
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,720
everybody should know 89 is and that's

280
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,399
sql injection

281
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,519
and then 352 which is csrf

282
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,760
the other side of this which is a really

283
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,399
interesting challenge was of the almost

284
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,560
400 cwes that were contributed over 75

285
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,160
percent of them

286
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,200
were only tested for three or fewer orgs

287
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,839
this tells me that at this point we do

288
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,760
not as an industry we have not

289
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,000
standardized on what we call our test

290
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,519
cases or what cwes we map our tests to

291
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,440
this makes the data collection quite an

292
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,079
interesting challenge when we try and

293
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,640
collate and correlate all of these type

294
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,760
different types of test results

295
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,000
so like i said also it's not purely the

296
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
data because again the data is looking

297
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,560
back in the past so what we do and we

298
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,440
did this in 2017 and we did did it again

299
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,800
in 2021 is we have a community survey

300
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,640
and we go through and we say hey tell us

301
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
a little bit about yourself because we

302
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,160
want to understand the demographic

303
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,800
but then we also ask hey within the top

304
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,560
10 so for

305
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,200
a certain set of cwes

306
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,519
do essentially a ranked voting of one

307
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,240
top one through four that you have

308
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,120
and tell us which ones that you feel

309
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,279
should be in the top 10 that are

310
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,560
unlikely to show up in the data

311
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,320
and the results of the survey this time

312
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,880
around was without a shadow of a doubt

313
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,760
we were told that ssrf was important

314
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,000
ssrf is a really interesting anomaly

315
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,720
because we had testing for ssrf and it

316
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,800
showed that there was a really low

317
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,880
incidence rate for it

318
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,040
but the community said hey by the way

319
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,200
the data may not be accurate ssrf is

320
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,480
important

321
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,160
so there might be a couple reasons for

322
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,639
this we don't know exactly why

323
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,120
but it may be the ssrf is hard to test

324
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,680
for and we have not found all the good

325
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,800
instances of it it may be that all of

326
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,680
the media from breaches from ssrf made

327
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,519
it top of mind for people and they

328
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,600
decided that hey this is what i've heard

329
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,440
of most recently for the last year or

330
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,959
two so it must be really important

331
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,200
we're not entirely sure but what we know

332
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,000
is as a result of the survey ssrf is in

333
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,240
the top 10. the second one was

334
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,639
unmaintained third-party components

335
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,600
and

336
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
in 2017 there actually wasn't a cwe for

337
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,800
this the only cwe related to vulnerable

338
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,160
components was a cwe for the top 10

339
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,120
itself

340
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,920
um so thankfully it exists now but that

341
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,320
one was through the data itself we had

342
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,240
enough data from testing that says this

343
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,600
is a problem

344
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
so then number three was insufficient

345
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,480
logging and monitoring so that was a bit

346
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,959
controversial in 2017

347
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,440
where people said hey by the way

348
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:25,950
um

349
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,120
[Music]

350
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,399
you're going to break we had a few

351
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,600
people tell us that we were going to

352
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,120
completely break the top 10 and make

353
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,959
people walk away from it because of

354
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,320
picking and sufficient logging and

355
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,839
monitoring because it's really really

356
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,440
hard to test for it

357
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,760
like how do you know what is sufficient

358
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,279
logging and monitoring so how do you

359
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,279
test for insufficient

360
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,839
but at the same time three years later

361
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,040
we had

362
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,120
an absolutely resounding level of

363
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,880
support saying you know what this really

364
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,959
is important

365
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,320
so through the rest of these we've had

366
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,160
most of the rest of them in the survey

367
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
found their way into the top ten in one

368
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,560
category or another because like i said

369
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,600
we had 400 cwes this time so we ended up

370
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,320
with a lot more cwes of coverage within

371
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,000
the risk categories in the top 10.

372
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,600
so we're here we're trying to manage

373
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
likelihood so if you remember the risk

374
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,240
equation of likelihood times impact

375
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,279
so we're looking at the likelihood

376
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,720
incidence rate was essentially the

377
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,120
number of apps we found at cwen divided

378
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,959
by the number of apps tested

379
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,320
but then we ran into some really

380
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,920
interesting scenarios because of the

381
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,320
data that we had and so we had for

382
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,440
instance cwe 552

383
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,279
so files or directories accessible to

384
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,720
external parties

385
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
has an incidence rate of about 56

386
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,440
percent

387
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,720
which at first blush seems really high

388
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,320
so we dug into it a little more and we

389
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,680
found that ao was found in 6200 apps

390
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,959
but only 11 000 apps were tested

391
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,240
so of the overall population of testing

392
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,839
only two percent of the entire

393
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,600
contributed population was actually

394
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,839
tested for the cwe

395
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,079
so the overall incidence rate was

396
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,000
somewhere just over one percent of the

397
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,800
population but we don't know

398
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,040
and so we realized we need to balance

399
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
out some of these

400
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,880
smaller more niche

401
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,680
cwes that were tested with trying to

402
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,519
figure out what's the level of assurance

403
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,160
that this is an accurate incidence rate

404
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,399
so if only two percent of the apple is

405
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,160
two percent of the population was

406
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,680
actually tested

407
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,560
for cwe 552

408
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,480
i don't have a really high assurance

409
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,560
rate that that is a statistically

410
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,000
significant chunk of the population

411
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,519
so we added in a factor that's

412
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
considered coverage so what percentage

413
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,839
of the population was actually tested

414
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,600
for that vulnerability so that gave us

415
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,519
some weight whether or not that incident

416
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,199
how accurate that incidence rate

417
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,440
actually was

418
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,199
so like i said though we have likelihood

419
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,199
times impact

420
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,440
incidence rate and coverage helps us

421
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,839
with likelihood but we still need impact

422
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,839
in 2017

423
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,279
impact was exploit and technical

424
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,079
impact we also use detectability which

425
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,639
technically is more into likelihood

426
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,440
but honestly the data source for this

427
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,199
exploit information was essentially the

428
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,800
collective experience of the leadership

429
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,600
team

430
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,079
we had no data to work off of that so it

431
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,240
was essentially a five-hour marathon

432
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
call where we argued back and forth

433
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,480
over what is the general level of

434
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,920
exploit or impact of the average of a

435
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,160
particular type of risk category which

436
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,079
is ridiculously difficult to try and

437
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,639
figure out what a typical vulnerability

438
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,560
is because we could always come up with

439
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,680
edge cases of how horrible or how

440
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,199
neutered a particular vulnerability was

441
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,720
so in 2021 since we had so much data

442
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
related to likelihood we wanted to see

443
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,440
if we could use data again for impact

444
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
because we didn't want to dilute the

445
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,440
data set that we had by making the other

446
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,360
half of the equation basically licking

447
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,600
our finger and sticking it in the wind

448
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,919
so we decided after some digging around

449
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,799
that it might work to use the sub scores

450
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,799
of exploit and impact from cvss

451
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,439
so we went over to our neighborhood

452
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,319
owasp dependency check project and we

453
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,079
set it up and we told it to update its

454
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,240
database from the mvd

455
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,520
we pulled that database out queried it

456
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,199
and then found that

457
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,840
of the cwes there were 241 cwes mapped

458
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,720
to the cves within that data set

459
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,240
so but we had almost 400

460
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,840
so not all of our cwes ever had a cve

461
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,400
issued against it or mapped against it

462
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,160
and one of the interesting things is one

463
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,400
example is vulnerable components

464
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,280
we will never have a cve mapped against

465
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,520
a vulnerable component cwe because it

466
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,160
will be mapped against the actual base

467
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,160
problem that was in the component itself

468
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,240
so if we look at the cwes that were

469
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,280
mapped

470
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,600
to this data we find that there's

471
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,280
somewhere around 125 000 of them

472
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,720
but 35 000 of them were marked with

473
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,840
other or no info and today and i haven't

474
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,280
had a chance to dig through it i'm not

475
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,120
entirely sure why there's an option to

476
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,320
pick other

477
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,520
versus no info they essentially end up

478
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,960
with the same thing

479
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,760
where

480
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,400
we don't know what cwe does

481
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,120
that cve actually matches to

482
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,160
so the largest individual cwe is

483
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,600
our friend cvcwe79

484
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
cross-site scripting is something that

485
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,080
usually dominates top 10 lists because

486
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,240
of a high frequency and it's really easy

487
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,559
to find

488
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,440
cwe 119 is interesting

489
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,120
if you play with web apps you don't run

490
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,960
into it a lot it has to do with buffer

491
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,320
overflows and memory management

492
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,280
cwe20

493
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,760
is a generic cwe for

494
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,679
input validation

495
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,240
and then you have our friend 89 which is

496
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,880
sql injection again 200 which was our

497
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,360
sensitive data exposure

498
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,720
264 which is a general category for

499
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,160
access control

500
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,760
doesn't really tell us what happened

501
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,880
just unauthorized access

502
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,360
and then this data tails off really fast

503
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,880
so there are only 20 cwes that were

504
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
mapped here that actually had more than

505
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,039
a thousand cdes against it

506
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,919
there are only 70 cwes that actually

507
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,799
have more than 100 cves

508
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,120
and of our data set 65 cwes only had one

509
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,840
or two cves mapped to it

510
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,120
so the other interesting thing in the

511
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
cvss scoring

512
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,559
was version 2 versus version 3 of cvss

513
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,200
so if you've done any defect management

514
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,120
you know the fun that you deal with when

515
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,520
you get into v2 versus v3

516
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,039
and just looking at the graph you can

517
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,320
see this is interesting because

518
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,480
cvss2 has a range that looks like it's

519
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,400
between three and ten

520
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,440
but cvss three is between essentially

521
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,840
one and six

522
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,679
part of that reason is because they

523
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,440
change the formula between the two and

524
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,000
they change the bounds that the score

525
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,559
subscores could actually be so if you

526
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,720
take all that weighting into account you

527
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,799
also find an interesting trend that in

528
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,280
cvss version three

529
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,640
within the impact sub score on average

530
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,159
it scores

531
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,120
almost a point and a half higher

532
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,000
within version three of cvss

533
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,799
versus version two for the same type of

534
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,039
vulnerabilities

535
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,960
so also notice if you go left from right

536
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,880
the amplitude seems to go up and that

537
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,840
has to do i believe with the number of

538
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,400
actual vulnerabilities

539
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,720
actually goes down so the fewer you have

540
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,640
the harder it is to have somewhat of a

541
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,679
normal setup

542
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,559
so

543
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,320
we looked at x-play as well and all of a

544
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,159
sudden this was even more dramatic of a

545
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,200
difference so in cvss v2 you're

546
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,320
somewhere between four and ten and in v3

547
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,880
your raw scores are between one and four

548
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,600
and we're trying so we realized

549
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,280
that that has to do with the difference

550
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,320
in v2 they let the scores go all the way

551
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
up to 10 but then they would

552
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,039
basically multiply times 0.4 they'd take

553
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,960
only 40 of the score

554
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,120
and in v3 they just capped it at four

555
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,159
and they said you know what we're not

556
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,520
going to do it that way we'll just do it

557
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,919
slightly differently

558
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,240
so overall the difference between them

559
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,559
was have about

560
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,720
almost half a point lower on average for

561
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,960
export which is also kind of interesting

562
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,200
on that setup

563
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,159
so we have this data portage right so to

564
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,159
calculate risk we now have distance rate

565
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,559
and testing coverage for likelihood we

566
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,200
have exploit and impact

567
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,240
for impact and so we kind of sprinkle

568
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,400
total occurrences on it as well because

569
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,039
there is some significance to how many

570
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,880
different apps were actually found to

571
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,760
have

572
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,240
particular types of cwvs so we wanted to

573
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,080
bring that in too because that has an

574
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,159
impact

575
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,880
so our not so secret formula so this is

576
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,960
essentially what we used

577
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,159
so we went through in between incidence

578
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,240
and coverage and exploit and impact and

579
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,080
occurrences

580
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,559
we weighted them

581
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,480
went through and essentially we spent

582
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,799
weeks working through different

583
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,039
scenarios we have

584
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,480
we looked at average and we looked at

585
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,640
high water mark

586
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,960
trying to figure out what makes the most

587
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,559
sense from this data so trying to

588
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,720
balance the data with the

589
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,799
decades of expertise we have as a

590
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,280
leadership team in terms of does this

591
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,760
seem to represent would this drive

592
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
appropriate behavior

593
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,240
and then the second half below here as i

594
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,919
broke it out because i wanted to see

595
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,080
depending on what part of the formula

596
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,320
how did it contribute to the overall

597
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,600
score

598
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
so for some things like broken access

599
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
control and cryptographic failures they

600
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,679
have most of their score comes from

601
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,480
incidents we find more of them

602
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,919
they have generally decent coverage

603
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,440
and then their number of occurrences are

604
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,280
fairly high the exploit and impact don't

605
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,799
weigh as much in their part of the

606
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,159
formula

607
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,520
on the other hand there are things that

608
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,039
may have a higher impact that we don't

609
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,400
find as often

610
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,039
so there's our eternal dilemma of trying

611
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,799
to go between

612
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,679
you know

613
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,080
what's worse the whole lot of low impact

614
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,960
or a few high impact and as humans we're

615
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,720
kind of bad about risk management in

616
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,400
that space

617
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,080
so it becomes an interesting challenge

618
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,840
to figure out how do we balance all of

619
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,919
this but at the end of the day as much

620
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,600
as we do all of this

621
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,120
if you're in the top 10 you're in the

622
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,360
top 10 whether you're number four or

623
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
your number five or your number eight

624
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,639
you're still in the top ten

625
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,919
so where do we go from here

626
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,080
so looking at how we built this

627
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,799
we need to get more consistent with cwes

628
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,120
we have in the data we have a number of

629
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,200
retired and archived that were still

630
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,919
being used

631
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,039
just don't map to them

632
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,240
so um

633
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,720
try to use root cause cwes as much as

634
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,400
possible we have some that were

635
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,159
completely mapped to categories there is

636
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,919
no information there we just have a

637
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,360
category we don't know the details of it

638
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,960
one of the main things that we're hoping

639
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,279
to do within the top 10 is fix this

640
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,799
stuff at the language and framework

641
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,400
level

642
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,120
we're hoping to drive this change so

643
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,400
csrf in 2007 was added to the top 10.

644
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
almost every single web app was

645
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,159
susceptible to csrf in 2007. so now in

646
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,799
2021 we're looking at single-digit

647
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,159
percentage susceptibility so just a

648
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,080
small tiny fraction of web apps are

649
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,640
still susceptible to csrf and typically

650
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,480
the more modern languages we don't have

651
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,120
that problem

652
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,640
the other thing that we're looking at is

653
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,039
don't just shift left

654
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,559
and you've heard that from a few people

655
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,880
we need to do more we need to expand and

656
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,039
assimilate security it needs to be just

657
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,960
part of a mindset and part of everything

658
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,559
else we do

659
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,159
and the other thing is is we have a lot

660
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,640
of security outside of code

661
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,360
code is really important and and i do

662
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,600
share uh mark's

663
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,919
mark curfey's note where i went looking

664
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,039
for these secure development guidelines

665
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,799
and was disappointed to see that we

666
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,279
hadn't messed with them in 11 years

667
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,679
um would love to see that come back but

668
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,240
at the same time we can't only focus on

669
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,400
code we have to focus on stuff that's

670
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,559
outside of that level of automation and

671
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,760
go to the human part as well

672
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,120
but thank you

673
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,400
um

674
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,039
again this is there's so many more

675
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,480
stories to tell with what we've done

676
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,720
with this but at the same time you know

677
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,360
i get my 25 minutes and i'm at my 25

678
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,279
minutes so thank you so much i

679
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,840
