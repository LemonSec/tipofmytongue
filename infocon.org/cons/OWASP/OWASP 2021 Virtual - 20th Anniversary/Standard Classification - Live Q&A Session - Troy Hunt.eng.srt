45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,360
with us live today so troy i guess the

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,600
the first one classic interview tell us

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,280
a little bit about yourself in

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
particular what i'd really love to hear

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,720
is this your software

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,880
development background what was the

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,040
first project you worked on

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,759
for pay

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,920
yeah good question so

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,719
i

55
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,560
i started building software for the web

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,520
in 95 because i like i saw the internet

57
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,799
and i went this is really really cool

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,479
it's like this might be something one

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,360
day i should uh i should try and start

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,680
learning a little bit about it and i was

61
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,599
i was at my first year university then

62
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,879
and

63
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,640
i was like looking through the the

64
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,160
course syllabus whatever it was i'm

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,440
trying to find like the web development

66
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,640
course there's no web development like

67
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,040
there was nothing at the time

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,920
so

69
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,800
my

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,640
beginning was i literally went and

71
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,920
bought the for dummies book and

72
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,319
somewhere on that shelf which my fiance

73
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,239
is has very kindly color coded all the

74
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,879
books no longer coded by technology so

75
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,280
summary in the yellow section down there

76
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,120
is html for dummies

77
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
uh and that's the book that i i started

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,519
to learn for or learn from rather

79
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,000
and and i built my first websites

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
literally using it for dummies book

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,200
so that the first one that i can recall

82
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,680
that that i built for money again

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,800
keeping in mind this is probably about

84
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,720
96 i think by the time i need money from

85
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,360
it

86
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,720
was a

87
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,840
a rental uh car went rental website and

88
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
this was just like a static brochure

89
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,000
site and in fact it was a company here

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,800
in southeast queensland called abel abel

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
and i saw this sign the other day and i

92
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,680
was in brisbane walking around i was

93
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,879
like i remember remember those guys

94
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,959
and i actually tried to find the website

95
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,480
and archive.org the other day but i

96
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,760
think it's actually even too old for

97
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,159
archives of org so by the time i found

98
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,239
the first version i was like no

99
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,400
that wasn't me yeah they got a flat

100
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,159
static brochure car rental

101
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,519
yeah website sounds familiar

102
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,159
what is this cgi script you know i

103
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,400
wonder what that might do well i didn't

104
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,920
have to worry about that because it had

105
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,599
no service functionality it's just like

106
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,040
html maybe you didn't have to worry

107
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,319
about css back then either

108
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,799
nostalgia

109
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,400
so one of the things that that's

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
actually very interesting to me is so

111
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,760
what was the circumstance or what

112
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,319
particular event inspired the creation

113
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,640
of have i been found

114
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,120
i i think the the catalyst if if we were

115
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
to call it that was the adobe data

116
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,760
bridge

117
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
and and there were a couple of things

118
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,400
about adobe that i thought was really

119
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,840
interesting and i'd sort of been

120
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,239
analyzing a bunch of data breaches and

121
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,560
writing blog posts about them

122
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,040
mostly because i find it

123
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,238
the thing i find really interesting

124
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,680
about data breaches is you get to see

125
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,279
someone else's dirty laundry all right

126
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,800
so oh so you're storing passwords like

127
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
that

128
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,440
why did you use that kind of key like

129
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,199
what on earth are you doing inside the

130
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,639
system and we've all got dirty laundry

131
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,560
in systems that we've built so looking

132
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,240
at other people's is a little bit i know

133
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,960
it's almost like a little bit

134
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,479
voyeuristic right

135
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,400
so i was finding it very interesting

136
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,800
looking at data breaches and then i

137
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,080
started doing things like actually

138
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,880
looking at uh patterns across breaches

139
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,639
so there was a point there i wrote a

140
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,639
blog post about sony and gorka two

141
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,240
different data breaches

142
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,400
both passwords and plain text

143
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,919
sometimes you have the same person in

144
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,600
both breaches and hey wouldn't you know

145
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,680
it like they're using the same password

146
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,080
and we we know that people do this but

147
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
having empirical data in front of you to

148
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
demonstrate that yeah yeah they really

149
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
do and like this is how frequently it

150
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,560
happens

151
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,720
was really interesting so when the adobe

152
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,919
database happened there were more than

153
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,080
150 million people in that

154
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,280
i thought well this is like a really

155
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,520
really big set of data i'll have a look

156
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,120
and i found myself in adobe twice

157
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,800
once was with my work account and once

158
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
was with my personal account

159
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,400
and i thought that was fascinating

160
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
because to the best of my memory i

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,479
hadn't given adobe any of my data

162
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,280
but i was a big macromedia dreamweaver

163
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,440
user uh back in the in the day and of

164
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,199
course adobe bought macromedia so my

165
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,759
data flowed to somewhere else

166
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,280
and i kind of went

167
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,400
like if if i don't know that my data is

168
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,840
held by a company and it's in data

169
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,960
breaches

170
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,160
and i do give this stuff a lot of

171
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,000
thought so if i don't know this like how

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,919
many other people don't know maybe i

173
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,240
should just like dump it all into a

174
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,479
great big azure table storage instance

175
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,840
and put a web interface in front of it

176
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,680
and then people can go and search

177
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,840
and and that's where it started and i i

178
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,360
honestly didn't think it'd be much more

179
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,639
than that i thought oh some of them i

180
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,160
might so use it you know this will be

181
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
this would be a bit of fun

182
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,759
and uh yeah now like eleven and a half

183
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,960
billion records later here we are

184
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,639
just just a few records

185
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,560
um

186
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,000
as as the breaches have come in

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
has there been

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,520
a breached

189
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,400
entity that just really shocked you like

190
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,080
you just thought they had their act

191
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,280
together and this wouldn't happen

192
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,600
you know i was going to

193
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,520
say ashley madison until you added the

194
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,960
bit about they have their act together

195
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,160
and that would then demonstrate that

196
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,280
i've been thinking a lot about ashley

197
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,880
madison which really wasn't

198
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,400
before the bridge which really wasn't

199
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,759
the case

200
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,880
i was going to say actually madison

201
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,639
because that's the one that shocked me

202
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,560
in terms of

203
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,479
the fact that

204
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,199
that it was so salacious and it had such

205
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,880
dire consequences you know literally

206
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,039
suicides on the back of that

207
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,680
uh but it look in in terms of thinking

208
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,000
that they really had their act together

209
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,120
if if we're entirely objective about it

210
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
could we think today of a single

211
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,639
organization

212
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,440
that would shock us if they had a breach

213
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,120
and i i can't you know i really can't i

214
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
mean let's say it was google who had a

215
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,160
breach it's all right

216
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,039
i'd i'd be a little bit surprised in so

217
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,240
far as they have all the money in the

218
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,520
world to invest in this sort of thing

219
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,960
super super smart technical people

220
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
however

221
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,000
they've got so much stuff out there and

222
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,639
it only takes one little mistake so i i

223
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,319
don't think i would be shocked if google

224
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,479
had a substantial data breach i don't

225
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,479
think i'd be shocked if anyone did

226
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,880
and it's it's just interesting when

227
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800
you think about people sort of saying

228
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,240
you know like who should you trust with

229
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
your data all right so which websites

230
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,680
should you sign up to don't sign up to

231
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,960
these ones over there because they look

232
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,840
dodgy sign up to these ones because they

233
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
look professional and then i'm like what

234
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,919
you mean professional like adobe and

235
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,919
dropbox and linkedin

236
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,840
you know i mean that's that's just

237
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,759
that's just not a measure of how likely

238
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,680
your data is to be

239
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,000
taken

240
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,360
sometimes i i often think that maybe

241
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,039
it's it's sort of the other way around

242
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,120
that when when you see that they've

243
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,560
invested a lot in that polished facade

244
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,199
i wonder where they skimped

245
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,560
well you know what i think's the other

246
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,759
way around so i had a question uh jesus

247
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,199
did it i lose track but i think it was

248
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,280
like yesterday in another ama very

249
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,080
similar to this and someone was like uh

250
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,479
how likely are people to leave an

251
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,159
organization once they've been breached

252
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,640
because obviously the implication there

253
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
is that this is an organization's poor

254
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,760
security

255
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,559
and

256
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,679
the bit that i think is the other way

257
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,120
around is

258
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
organizations that have been breached

259
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,080
have

260
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
had some very very good first-hand

261
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,560
experience of being breached they have a

262
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,440
heightened awareness of security

263
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,920
beyond that of the organization which

264
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,320
hasn't been breached so i'd be really

265
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,720
reticent to say look at adobe and go

266
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,000
well i'm not going to trust them with my

267
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,920
data again i'm going to go to this other

268
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,440
company over here

269
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
who is also a big name who hasn't had a

270
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,760
data breach and and somehow that is

271
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,399
going to be a better security posture i

272
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,080
i feel that that's that's

273
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,279
just completely the wrong way around

274
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,490
fair point

275
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,279
[Music]

276
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,440
now actually we had one question that

277
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,320
was submitted earlier just around

278
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,560
the breach data itself

279
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,080
and

280
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
they mentioned i'm interested in

281
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,040
everything to do with two-factor

282
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,399
authentication

283
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,720
do you see in the breach data

284
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,880
information on

285
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,440
usage of two factor

286
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,279
basically are you able to glean some

287
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,519
information about adoption rates by

288
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,360
users from the breach data you're

289
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,959
getting

290
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,279
so we uh we don't need data breaches for

291
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,920
that um and in fact i'm just trying to

292
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,240
look up the reference here there was uh

293
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,000
it's a bit in the news about twitter the

294
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,160
other day who are saying it was

295
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,480
something like two percent of their

296
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
subscriber base uh

297
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,399
users 2fa

298
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,440
and we've sort of gone like that's

299
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,200
like two percent like why don't you let

300
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,279
more people know uh well actually to

301
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,519
finish answering your question um i

302
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,399
don't

303
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,399
usually see information in data breaches

304
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,560
about turf adoption and to be honest

305
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,920
there's a lot of organizations out there

306
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,120
that don't even offer it in the first

307
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,279
place uh some of the more mainstream

308
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,200
ones do but a lot of the larger ones

309
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,959
like twitter

310
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,279
social media platforms banks we haven't

311
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,440
really seen data breaches in recent

312
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,760
years i'm saying this just whilst i've

313
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,040
said linkedin but of course that was

314
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,920
back in 2012 dropbox was 2012 as well

315
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,360
but what's really interesting is when

316
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,120
you do look at the figures which

317
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,200
organizations publish about adoption

318
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,760
rates and they're all like stunningly

319
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,360
stunningly low

320
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,519
and and i remember uh years ago i had a

321
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,120
chat to someone at dropbox

322
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,640
after seeing similar figures and i was

323
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,600
like

324
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,480
but but 2fa is like so good why don't

325
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,519
you push this harder and they said well

326
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,240
but the problem is is that when we push

327
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,720
it harder we have to deal with a lot of

328
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
other account lockout problems and then

329
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,480
the problem you're dealing with is you

330
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,240
get someone emailing a support desk and

331
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,720
they're like hey i went to your website

332
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,640
and i turned on 2fa so that if someone

333
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,480
has my username my password but not my

334
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,240
soft token authenticator they can't log

335
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
in uh i have my username password but i

336
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,160
don't have my soft token authenticator

337
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,839
can you please let me in

338
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,760
and then they're like well

339
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,120
which one which one was it like what

340
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,040
what do you want and inevitably then you

341
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,360
fall back to much more laborious time

342
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,839
consuming resource intensive processes

343
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,920
to try and verify

344
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,760
that this is the actual owner of the

345
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
account and not someone trying to break

346
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,040
through the very defense that the actual

347
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,160
owner of the account put in there in the

348
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,200
first place

349
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,040
and and i think the overarching problem

350
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,839
is that 2fa is just a very blunt very

351
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,800
user unfriendly implementation

352
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,279
some of it's better than others but for

353
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,279
the most part this is why we see really

354
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,440
really low adoption rates yeah i think

355
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,880
really twitter does a pretty good job of

356
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,320
it i can't remember the last time i

357
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,240
entered a twitter 2fa code it's probably

358
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,639
the last time i set up a new device

359
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,560
but still we're like these tiny tiny

360
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,839
fractions of a percent

361
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,519
another submitted question that's

362
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,959
also piqued my interest a little bit

363
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,360
what do you think we'll see

364
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,560
so at some time in a glorious rosy

365
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,120
future do you think that we'll see an

366
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,880
industry standard

367
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,600
change password type api

368
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,880
so that users could have their password

369
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,480
management tools

370
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,839
manage password rotation for them

371
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,000
is that impossible and then the next

372
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,760
part of the question would be and if we

373
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,920
could do it should we

374
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,720
yeah

375
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,399
and i think that the second part is

376
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,800
actually the really interesting bit uh

377
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
and maybe if we start there because part

378
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,120
of the problem is and i've i've been a

379
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,959
massive proponent of password managers

380
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,399
for a very long time

381
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,920
part of the problem is if you have a

382
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,000
password manager so i've got all my

383
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,720
things in in one password for example uh

384
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
so i have them in one password

385
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,120
every time i create an account

386
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
i have like

387
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,360
40 random characters or something like

388
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
that which are completely unique across

389
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,959
every web asset

390
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,600
now if you're having long strong

391
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,399
genuinely strong and unique passwords on

392
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,600
every single web asset

393
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,120
does it actually make sense to be

394
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,959
rotating them on a regular basis like

395
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,959
the value proposition of that then goes

396
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,160
down it'll be different if it's like

397
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,680
yeah i have my dog's name on every

398
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,760
single website that i use

399
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,040
and then as soon as your dog's name get

400
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,480
compromised from one place not only does

401
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,680
it potentially get cracked if it's

402
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,959
stored as a hash because it's going to

403
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,320
be a weak password and the sort of thing

404
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,639
that will be cracked but then of course

405
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,000
it's in plain text somewhere and that

406
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,519
immediately unlocks everything else like

407
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,560
that's

408
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,480
that i see is as needing rotation

409
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,760
but then you're not you're not really

410
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,040
solving the root cause of the problem

411
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,480
are you and once you solve the root

412
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
cause of the problem you don't really

413
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,560
need rotation certainly not in the same

414
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,920
way as before

415
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,000
now should we have a

416
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,160
a standard implementation for password

417
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
reset i think that would be

418
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,160
nice i think it would also be nice to

419
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,600
have a standard implementation even just

420
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,800
for login

421
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,880
look at the way password managers do it

422
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,959
you you go to a website you hit submit

423
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,160
and it's looking at the dominance

424
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,279
looking at the network request and it's

425
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,720
trying to figure out what is the name of

426
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,480
the password field and what is the name

427
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,160
of the username field so that we can

428
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,079
come back and pre-populate

429
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,480
like this is this is just a reminder of

430
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,920
how much the web is stuck together

431
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,959
sticky tape

432
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,040
like that feels like a very very very

433
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,560
rough way of doing it

434
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,040
so i would like to see a standard

435
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,199
implementation there but to the best of

436
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,959
my knowledge i really would love someone

437
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,480
to prove me wrong with this as well that

438
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,160
there's not much not much happening in

439
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,560
that space

440
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,880
thanks for that

441
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
we got a question submitted on the slack

442
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,959
channel thank you chris

443
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,240
and he says

444
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,160
i have found the ability to get details

445
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,399
from have i been phoned for domains i

446
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,040
own to be very valuable is this a widely

447
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,279
used feature everyone i tell about it

448
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,399
isn't even aware it's possible

449
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,680
yeah so

450
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,199
maybe they don't know about it because i

451
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,040
hide the domain search feature under a

452
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,320
big link on the top of the website which

453
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,160
says domain search the number of times

454
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
people go to the website and then they

455
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,760
email me and say is there a way of doing

456
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,320
domain search and i'm like yeah

457
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,000
click the domain search link and then

458
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,040
follow the instructions so i

459
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,800
i think it's pretty obvious but then

460
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,320
again if multiple people are missing it

461
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,800
maybe not uh so the answer the question

462
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,880
is yes it's very popular i haven't done

463
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,000
any

464
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,839
detailed steps on it for a couple of

465
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,079
years now but the last time i did it was

466
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,160
more than half the fortune 500 were

467
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,120
using it

468
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,600
um or getting it for free too so good on

469
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,040
those guys it works well yeah

470
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,440
i think i'm not a very good businessman

471
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,320
uh

472
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,399
so it look it's used really extensively

473
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,959
there by a lot of big brands it's also

474
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,959
used uh very extensively now by

475
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,560
governments there are 27 different

476
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,680
governments that are doing tld wide

477
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,279
searches for gov

478
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,440
domains which is which is super super

479
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,399
cool

480
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,560
uh i i forget the exact number of

481
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
searches that are done but i know that

482
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,240
every time i load data and i see the

483
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,600
numbers about how many people get

484
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,880
notified

485
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,560
that there's always a substantial number

486
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,160
of organizations that are getting

487
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,000
notified that email addresses and their

488
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,320
domains have been in a breach

489
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,759
so yeah look at

490
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,079
it it seems to work and people seem to

491
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,719
be happy with it

492
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,480
okay thank you

493
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,600
now another question that was submitted

494
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,320
by one of my local colleagues here

495
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,800
so he pointed out the fact that that you

496
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,160
are a strong proponent of ubiquity gear

497
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,440
and also that you love just love jet

498
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,639
skiing

499
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,720
so he was asking if you've considered

500
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,519
the possibility of combining those two

501
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,519
loves by providing say

502
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,959
access points afloat for recreational

503
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,799
boaters

504
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,039
i feel like i have a blog post for just

505
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,880
about everything so i have a blog post

506
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,760
from march 2017 titled how i finally fix

507
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,359
the dodgy wi-fi on my jet ski with

508
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,520
ubiquiti's unifi mesh

509
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,400
so

510
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,880
there is a blog post for this

511
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,799
which was more about

512
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,400
uh using their tech to create mesh

513
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,919
networks so that i could get enough

514
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,760
coverage from my house

515
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,000
down onto my my pontoon where the where

516
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,520
the jetty gets mowed so if i want to set

517
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,360
my jet ski down there

518
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,960
i i have wi-fi

519
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,039
so so there's that i i do um i do find

520
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,240
interesting i've got

521
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,480
14 ubiquiti access points around the

522
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,799
house in different places now and i can

523
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,039
go over to my my neighbor's place which

524
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,799
is across the water we live on on the

525
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,679
water here and it must be 100 metres

526
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,039
over there and like i can sit in their

527
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,280
backyard and have wi-fi at home which is

528
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,559
um

529
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,240
which is ah this is geeky but it's kind

530
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,480
of cool

531
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,280
100 meters wouldn't that be nice

532
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,799
i have to be careful when i go around

533
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,160
the corner to the kitchen because we

534
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,919
have steel studs

535
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,679
ah right well you know that the biggest

536
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,240
problem that i have with with um

537
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,840
with connectivity and

538
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,280
or range is most people probably know

539
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,520
like it depends on what is between you

540
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,960
and the access point

541
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,600
so i have a ubiquity uh g4 doorbell

542
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,080
which is a really really cool doorbell

543
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
the problem is is that the doorbell is

544
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,400
on the other side of a solid concrete

545
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,600
wall

546
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,480
so

547
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,400
it's like i have an access point just

548
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,720
here i almost have line of sight

549
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,799
bothered that the house or the wall of

550
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,400
the house which you can get good signal

551
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,240
through but then it goes

552
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,160
down about i know probably like 10

553
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,000
meters and there's a solid wall and then

554
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,720
the doorbell which only works over wi-fi

555
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,160
keeps dropping off

556
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,360
so occasionally i've got someone like

557
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,039
literally banging on the door because

558
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,320
they're like dude your doorbell doesn't

559
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,600
in fact your doorbell is literally

560
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,120
glowing red and says can't connect to

561
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,640
wi-fi which isn't a very professional

562
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,760
look when people come over to your house

563
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,840
so i think they need like a they need an

564
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,520
external antenna or something on that

565
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,760
thing

566
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,280
excellent

567
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,520
all right one more question here

568
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,799
so

569
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,320
feel free to talk about this one for as

570
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,080
long as you want while i think of some

571
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,600
other things to ask you

572
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,440
what do you think are the unique

573
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,960
security risks

574
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,039
in the ai and machine learning space

575
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,799
i i've kind of feel that the the ai and

576
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,640
ml bit does become a little bit

577
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,960
hyperbolic in the same way as

578
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,000
as blockchain becomes a bit hyperbolic i

579
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,240
remember i was at um

580
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,039
infosec eu uh in london a couple of

581
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,640
years ago back when we used to go places

582
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,000
remember that

583
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,240
and i'm walking around like this massive

584
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,720
hall and it's it's a very similar to a

585
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,000
black hat style thing where it's just

586
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,080
like vendors and stuff everywhere

587
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,320
and there's this one stand which is

588
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,160
selling literally the the name on the

589
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
stand was next gen blockchain so they

590
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
come and buy next-gen blockchain and it

591
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,240
just made me laugh because so much of it

592
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,360
is

593
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,039
is obviously pitched

594
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,360
at sales managers and and people making

595
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,039
purchasing decisions who may not be that

596
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,559
in tune with the tech

597
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,240
i i think what's interesting about the

598
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,960
whole ai and ml bit is

599
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,799
it's all still just code right and it

600
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,320
might be self-learning or self-healing

601
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,799
code or code which can write itself

602
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,039
it's still just code

603
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,320
this is what's underneath the whole

604
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,280
thing

605
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,880
um i i guess for code that can learn and

606
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,039
evolve on its own i think that makes it

607
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,400
really interesting on both sides of the

608
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,240
fence an infosec because on the one hand

609
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,679
we're saying

610
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,520
i i suspect this question was very much

611
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,440
around like what if the bad guys get it

612
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
you know what if the bad guys start

613
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,840
using ai so the robots get smarter and

614
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
in some sort of like skynet world they

615
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,159
somehow managed to pwn more things and

616
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,919
it's like yeah okay that's that that's

617
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,000
that's a reasonable concern

618
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,240
uh the good guys have got it too so

619
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,640
we're seeing ai style behaviors

620
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,960
increasingly make their way into into

621
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,799
defensive technologies so

622
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,039
uh and even if we think about the way

623
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,919
that defensive tech is getting smarter

624
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,039
things like

625
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,720
user behavioral analytics like isn't it

626
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,080
really cool now that we can have

627
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,600
software that doesn't just look for like

628
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,679
known bad patterns but starts to

629
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,840
understand the way people interact with

630
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,600
machines and because it can understand

631
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,039
the way they interact with machines it

632
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,400
can start to

633
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,360
identify deviations from the norm

634
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,919
i like getting away from very sort of

635
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,360
binary security positions such as

636
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,200
is your username and password correct

637
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
yes cool okay you get in you get to do

638
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,240
anything

639
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,080
i like the more uba style approach where

640
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,159
you might say look an organization is

641
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,280
running

642
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,600
let's say some form of endpoint security

643
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,960
where

644
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,400
bob normally logs into the sales

645
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,240
department each day and he does a bit of

646
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,840
work on his spreadsheets and that's it

647
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
one day bob logs in from beijing and

648
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,120
pulls down five gigabytes worth of

649
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
marketing material so well

650
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,880
maybe it's not bob you know it doesn't

651
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,240
matter that the username and password

652
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,640
are right this is not a behavioral norm

653
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,600
for bob

654
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,280
uh so that's where i i think we have a

655
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,400
lot of potential in that that ai space

656
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,760
and it just sits on the other side of

657
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,440
the scale to the to the people doing

658
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,120
malicious things with access to io

659
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,039
all right excellent thank you

660
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,360
uh we got a couple more questions in

661
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,480
and

662
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,360
so a little bit of a challenge about um

663
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,440
or maybe you know can you lift

664
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,039
lift the covers a little around have i

665
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,520
been pwned itself

666
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,640
and the

667
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
the listener was asking our search is

668
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,840
locked how does that affect data privacy

669
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,960
does this get shared with anyone

670
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,880
yeah good question not as far as i know

671
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,039
so it certainly doesn't explicitly

672
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,520
happen intentionally

673
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,240
no it's yeah one of the the joys of

674
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,880
havoc on is it it is such a simple

675
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,640
simple simple thing it's like what you

676
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,159
see is pretty much what you get there's

677
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,840
a box on the front and you press submit

678
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,280
and it makes a query and then it comes

679
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,720
back and pulls back the data

680
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,880
so that there is a section in the faqs

681
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,679
there uh about logging and it says

682
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,320
nothing is explicitly logs if you and

683
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,640
i'm trying to make sure i remember

684
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,159
what does get recorded for various

685
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,600
reasons which i'll explain what doesn't

686
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,120
but certainly that front page when you

687
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,200
do a search no it doesn't log in a thing

688
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
certainly not at a code level

689
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,919
there are transient logs which both

690
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,080
cloudflare will store so everything goes

691
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,320
through cloudflare so i do have the

692
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,919
ability to pull back i think it's about

693
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,799
like one hour of queries from cloudflare

694
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,559
logs and they get purged

695
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,679
there will be

696
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,760
logs that happen on the azure side of

697
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,080
things everything is is sort of turned

698
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,400
off to the fullest extent possible but i

699
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,840
could sit there and literally watch the

700
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,000
queries that are coming through in real

701
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,840
time a little terminal you can pop up

702
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,279
and it shows every request coming

703
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,480
through

704
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
so you know that that would be

705
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,960
that would be possible uh and this is

706
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,559
one of the reasons why things like the

707
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,960
phone passwords feature has has an

708
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,720
anonymity model on it it's like look

709
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,760
let's let's just remove any concern

710
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,000
whatsoever and make sure that

711
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,840
even if i logged everything for at least

712
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,320
for that particular feature

713
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,360
then i couldn't do anything with it

714
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,799
anyway

715
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,640
domain searches going back to that there

716
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,799
is some logging on the domain search

717
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,840
first of all that's how i know about the

718
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,600
fortune 500 thing

719
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,679
but second of all i i need that because

720
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,039
the domain search goes through a

721
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,520
verification process where you need to

722
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,440
initiate the search and then there needs

723
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,120
to be a point at which you either

724
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
receive a confirmation email to one of

725
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,960
the standard email addresses on the

726
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,720
domain or uh make a dns entry or or

727
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,159
other so there has to be this sort of

728
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,080
persistence

729
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,440
there's probably an argument to be made

730
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,880
about is this the sort of thing that

731
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,080
could be purged over time

732
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,919
but then again there's there's a bit of

733
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,440
value to this too and the thing that

734
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,120
come immediately to mind as i i

735
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,880
mentioned the government situation

736
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,240
before when i unborn onboarded on board

737
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,520
the first government which was the uk

738
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,640
uh one of the things that was actually

739
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,960
really valuable is i said look

740
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,520
it'd be great if we knew how many people

741
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,240
uh are doing searches against gov dot uk

742
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,840
assets like

743
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,520
we're government we don't always talk

744
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,320
real well between each apartment be cool

745
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,480
to know which departments around the uk

746
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,320
are actually using this service and then

747
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
we can like roll everyone up into this

748
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,760
one thing we can do it essentially we

749
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,039
can add all the other departments which

750
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,799
aren't using it already

751
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,799
and it was it was just the domain search

752
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,600
history there which again is sort of a

753
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,120
i guess a necessary part of being able

754
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,640
to do the verification which was useful

755
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,080
for that

756
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,120
so yeah i guess that's uh that that's

757
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,640
the answer but if you want more details

758
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,840
for the person to ask that question go

759
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,919
to the faqs and have a look at there or

760
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,200
ping me on twitter if anyone's got

761
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,080
specific questions as well

762
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,360
you're muted john

763
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,400
i did that of course

764
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,080
in the lockdown life you know stuff is

765
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,440
going on in the kitchen so it's like oh

766
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,720
i better mute

767
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,039
you know it's lunch is getting made

768
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,720
so a question that just came in

769
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,240
you partner with many different

770
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,720
organizations and perhaps some people

771
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
might find some of those

772
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,240
questionable

773
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,840
what do you feel

774
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,080
is the benefit of allowing intelligence

775
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,799
agencies to have ingestion pipelines

776
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,440
from have i been pumped

777
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,360
you know for a moment i was like hey i

778
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,279
thought they were really nice which is a

779
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,159
questionable one but i i suspect the

780
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,600
question here

781
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,320
is around uh some of the governments

782
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,080
there's 27 governments

783
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,279
there's been a couple of the governments

784
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,440
and i'm going to avoid calling them out

785
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,279
by name at the risk of offending someone

786
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,039
from one of these company uh countries

787
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,559
rather because of

788
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,559
i think what the the ask of this

789
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,039
question is implying is that

790
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,200
they don't like say the

791
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,159
uh

792
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,240
the the human rights history for example

793
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,799
in one of these one of these countries

794
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,760
um

795
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,360
assuming this is the case and it's not

796
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,960
just like look you don't like ubiquity

797
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,760
or lenovo or one password or nord i

798
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,559
think they're the ones i have

799
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,720
relationships with uh assuming that's

800
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,159
the case

801
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,760
we've got to remember for these

802
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,200
governments

803
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,720
i'll pick australia no one gets too

804
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,919
upset about australia because we don't

805
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,039
really do a lot

806
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,480
in terms of upsetting other parts of the

807
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,840
world don't believe what's on the news

808
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,720
at the moment hyperbolic anyway

809
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,320
the australian government can go through

810
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,559
and query any one of the domains that

811
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,880
they have control over with or without

812
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,880
my support they literally go to domain

813
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,039
search and then if they want to search

814
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,120
say cyber.gov that iu they're like okay

815
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,240
cool i'll just get an email to that

816
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,159
address or i'll upload a file a dns

817
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,760
entry or something and they can do the

818
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,919
search so they've always had that

819
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,120
ability

820
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,240
and the relationships with the

821
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,480
governments is is just to try and remove

822
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,880
some of the mechanical barriers that are

823
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,799
designed to stop abuse and to make it

824
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,320
easier for them to access the data they

825
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,240
have access to anyway

826
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,399
the the other thing that i'd sort of say

827
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,640
there and again assuming someone's

828
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,919
referring to a government that they view

829
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,960
as dystopian or something like effect

830
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,720
this is their data

831
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,919
and i'm

832
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,720
very much of the view that

833
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,640
when i'm in a data breach

834
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,159
and i was in another one just the other

835
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,399
day when i'm in a data breach that's my

836
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,480
data that that's there in that breach

837
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
and i should have access to it

838
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,039
uh and if it's a company that's in there

839
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,399
or their email addresses are in there

840
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,840
that's that's their data and they should

841
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,440
have access to it so i believe it's the

842
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,720
same as governments they should have

843
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,880
easy access to that

844
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,880
now that said there

845
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
there are limits so if we pick some easy

846
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,039
ones if um

847
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,200
if kim jong-un pops up tomorrow and goes

848
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,000
hey

849
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,279
you know can you uh can you help out uh

850
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,120
glorious nation north korea with domain

851
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,240
searches

852
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,840
uh that that's pretty easy because we

853
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,520
have export controls

854
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
over over north korea we have export

855
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
controls over other parts of the world

856
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,960
and we have a department of foreign

857
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,799
affairs and trade which is very explicit

858
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,799
about what sorts of uh goods and

859
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,480
services you can offer to some parts of

860
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,679
the world and that's not something that

861
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,720
i'd break

862
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,760
because i'm pretty sure bad stuff

863
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,279
happens too if you do that

864
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,120
but if it's just simply that

865
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,039
there is another part of the world who's

866
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,399
whose policies the you know we we're

867
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,960
not as aligned to as say australia or

868
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,279
the uk or new zealand when's new zealand

869
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,960
coming on john maybe you can talk to

870
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,399
someone anyway

871
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,279
uh

872
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,200
that's uh yeah so that i think that's

873
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,480
where the question was and that's that's

874
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,320
my feeling on it

875
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,760
yeah that actually was the follow-up

876
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,159
have you ever said no to anyone

877
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,720
all right um

878
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,279
let us just say i stopped returning

879
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,880
emails in one case

880
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,039
and i see we have just about a minute

881
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,799
left and i'll actually give you an

882
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,279
opportunity to do a plug if you'd like

883
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,919
chris was asking if you have plans for

884
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,120
any future online courses such as with

885
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,200
pluralsight

886
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
uh we are talking about a few different

887
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,120
things the the stuff that's that's in

888
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,720
the pipeline coming out at the moment

889
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,240
we've released the first episode of this

890
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,159
was we've done a series for one password

891
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,159
called hello ciso

892
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,159
and and this is cool because look i mean

893
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,360
pluralsight's really cool but it's

894
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,559
something that you pay for when you get

895
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,000
a subscription and and so on and so

896
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,679
forth the series we're doing with one

897
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,919
password it's just it's just on youtube

898
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,399
and it's free and available to everyone

899
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,600

900
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,520
we've uh put the first episode out a few

901
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,880
weeks ago i think we're going to try and

902
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,640
do about one a month

903
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,000
and that's going to keep us going until

904
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,840
well into next year as well so keep an

905
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,159
