breaches as uh as steve mentioned

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,079
okay but first i would like to introduce

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,520
the platform when i got the main

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,800
information from which is how i pinpoint

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,840
which it can be used as a defensive tool

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,920
uh it covers some breaches i like some

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,760
lessons and

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,079
and from these bridges and finish with a

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,600
little bit of trivia

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,520
all information discussed in this

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,160
presentation is from public sources i

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,559

also information sources are

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
acknowledged as much as possible in the

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,479
presentation without filling it with

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,759
references there are quite a few so uh

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,400

after the presentation if you guys want

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,799
to read more about it

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,320
all right

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,960
let's talk about how i beam pound or hiv

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,520
p as i would refer to it during the rest

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,280
of the presentation

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
hiv p was created and is maintained by

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,920
fellowship troy hunt

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,600
these two screenshots that you see right

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,479
now are from the side the first one is

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,560
from the home page where you can input

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
an email address phone number to check

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,200
if it has been compromised the one on

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,439
the right is to check if the password

52
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,680
you are planning to use or are using

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,000
have already been compromised

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,320
it has a lot of cool features uh besides

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,560
these two i just mentioned such as the

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,600
notify me allows you to set a

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,119
notification

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,840
to know if your details are compromised

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,520
uh the domain search allows you to

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,200
search by domain that have been

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,480
compromised

62
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,319
the who's been found to check a list of

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,480
all compromised sites that have been

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,440
reported to how i've been found or hiv

65

69
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,959
important to remember all these costs

70
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,840
money uh troy will have to pay for

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,040
security for servers for disk space etc

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,560
etc etc

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,800

check if passport one has been

79
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,560
previously preached

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,000
okay

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,120
so

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
i have this ready to go as you can see

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,360
so we just type password one

84
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
pin

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,440
ah there you go has been seen four

86
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,280
thousand six hundred fifty five times

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,519
for those of you who use password one

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,599
don't use it

89
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,959
all right uh let's move on

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,159
okay

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,080
back to our presentation hopefully it

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,319
works

93
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,640
okay now let's move to the core part of

94
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,120
this presentation the breaches

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,640
we are going to cover the following

96
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,080
three bridges

97
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
raychat which is from iran

98
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,200
now i was not sure if iran would fall

99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,599
under apac but thought the lessons

100
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,280
learned from it outweighs the

101
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,360
technicality whether it belongs to apac

102
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,560
or not

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,959
oxfam australia yes the charity

104
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,040
organization the sole purpose is to help

105
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,200
the poor uh dominos india

106
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
okay let's start with an interesting one

107
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,599
the rage hat bridge

108
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
that occurred early this year

109
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,159
first thing first i'm going to go

110
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,599
through a brief introduction of the

111
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,799
company

112
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,840
raychat was founded in 2017. he sought

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
to make a name for itself as a business

114
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,239
and social media application

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,480
it partnered with businesses and website

116
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,639
which used it for sales and customer

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,759
services

118
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,079
among other things it was featured at

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,440
iran silk road startup summit in 2018

120
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,680
and was rated as one of iran's most

121
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,560
popular new companies and of course

122
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
without having found the company when

123
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,880
defunct this year but the salary is

124
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,720
still up and the service appears to be

125
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,759
running

126
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,600
i could not find any articles or

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,840
information regarding the current status

128
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,479
of the company the one thing to note is

129
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,360
that it is a driving business the social

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,919
media business they type that attract

131
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,039
lots of investments

132
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,320
it is not exactly what happened but the

133
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,240
articles i found at least two different

134
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,800
breaches that seems to be the same

135
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,039
however reports that 938

136
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,600
981 email addresses ip addresses browser

137
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
user agents and passwords

138
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,600
were stolen on the 31st of january 2021

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,720
i submitted to this database on 4th july

140
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,680
2021 it's saying that there are multiple

141
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,240
articles around that say it was 150

142
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,440
million user data that had been leaked

143
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
the first instance where the leaked data

144
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,479
was discovered was approximately at 7 20

145
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,360
a.m monday may 3rd 2021

146
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,759
the database was put up for sale on a

147
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,240
prominent russian hacker website

148
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,639
it was unclear if the data was extracted

149
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,120
on the attack of the 31st of january but

150
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
it contained a significant amount of

151
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,280
information of iranian citizens using

152
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
the site

153
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,520
the breaches occur because of a

154
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,560
misconfiguration on a database in

155
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,960
use which allow remote attackers access

156
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,960
to all the contents of the database

157
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,000
so what happened now first please

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,080
forgive my pronunciation

159
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,240
obtiachenko discovered the

160
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,199
misconfiguration in the mongodb database

161
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,919
and reported to the company the company

162
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,160
for unknown reasons did not respond to

163
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,880
the researcher and did not fix the fault

164
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,600
as a matter of fact the when the achenko

165
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,000
posted the misconfiguration in twitter

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the company initially responded with a

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,560
tweet negating the report

168
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,520
according to the action code 267 million

169
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
accounts were available due to the

170
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,039
misconfiguration

171
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,360
which included information such as

172
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,960
addresses passwords metadata encrypted

173
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,720
messages

174
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,639
once the achenko went public with the

175
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,639
findings it seems the company had a

176
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,280
change of heart acknowledged the breach

177
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,199
say that nothing was compromised and

178
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,880
reported they were working with the

179
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,840
researcher to resolve the fault

180
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,560
they also said the legal department was

181
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,599
investigating the case interesting

182
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,759
it is unclear if the hack occurred

183
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,080
before or after the researcher made the

184
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,800
vulnerability public but one thing is

185
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,199
clear the lack of action by the company

186
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,680
gave time to for the hackers to perform

187
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,440
the attack and steal the information

188
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,360
it is unlikely that all the data was

189
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,840
stolen due to its size but has reported

190
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,319
150 million record at the very least

191
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,280
where

192
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,440
the attack interestingly was an

193
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,080
automated bulk attack called meow which

194
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,160
here which hands for misconfigured

195
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,880
databases downloads as much data as

196
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,120
possible that replaces the database with

197
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,080
the word meow

198
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,199
from this example we can conclude that

199
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,919
if a researcher reports a vulnerability

200
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,000
the least a company can do is

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
investigate

202
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,280
i will advise to acknowledge the work of

203
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,879
the researcher and provide some

204
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,520
financial incentive for the work even if

205
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,840
there is no backbone the program

206
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,680
at the end of the day is their time they

207
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,319
are investing on your security

208
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,360
if the vulnerability is confirmed fix it

209
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,759
no point denying it nothing good will

210
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,240
come out from denying the vulnerability

211
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,800
if a researcher founded soaking every

212
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
hacker in the world

213
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,240
hackers are out there looking to exploit

214
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,639
misconfiguration like this and do it on

215
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,479
a daily basis

216
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,199
another one if it happens the only way

217
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,319
to contain it is honesty the more honest

218
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,879
you are with your customers the better

219
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,120
give them a chance to protect their data

220
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,599
at least appear to care for them

221
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,440
at the end of the day without customers

222
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,839
there is no business businesses have to

223
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,240
look after their customers

224
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
another important one is that the

225
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,920
hackers got away with it

226
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
the companies suffer and lost money but

227
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,720
the hackers only made money out of these

228
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,800
of their crimes

229
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,959
it is difficult for authorities to hunt

230
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,120
down these criminals especially when the

231
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,720
crime is carried out from another

232
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,399
country

233
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,959
finally make sure you have a security

234
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,600
program in place this needs to happen it

235
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,360
is important that the ceo entrepreneur

236
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,839
business owner acknowledge this

237
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,839
if there is not enough money testing

238
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,680
help from professionals

239
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,240
front follow the vendor's advice buy a

240
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,480
scanning tool do the best you can to

241
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,120
scan the code the server configuration

242
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,920
and all the low-line fruit as we call it

243
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,080
make an effort to secure the business as

244
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,000
much as possible

245
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,240
there are plenty of consultancy small

246
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,480
ones that can help the business get

247
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,959
started i acknowledge

248
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,360
it is not a cheap service for a crash

249
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,160
trap startup or small business but it's

250
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,240
enough that there is enough information

251
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640
out there to at least get started and

252
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,200
prevent vulnerabilities such as these

253
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,279
also there is os which is entirely free

254
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,680
has the chapters all over the globe and

255
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,360
thousands of projects to help with

256
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,000
security

257
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,200
okay let's move to another spectrum one

258
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
that should shock most of us one that we

259
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,440
would think will not happen

260
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,680
but the reality is in the hacking world

261
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,320
there are no morals or boundaries

262
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,800
these criminals have no qualms on who

263
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,680
they hack their focus is on the value of

264
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,600
their hack

265
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,399
who is of oxfam faculties from their

266
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,160
side

267
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,320

emergency and campaigning to improve the

277

lives of disadvantaged people around the

278
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,440
world they aim to give disadvantaged

279
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,880
people improve access to social services

conflict and disaster

283
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,640
why would anyone hack an organization

284
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,720
like oxfam is beyond me

285
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,399
what was the breach

286
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,279
it occurred in january 2021.

287
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,839
author and australia bridge exposed 1.8

288
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,560
million unique email addresses

289
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,959
or supporters of the charity the data

290
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,200
was put up for sale on a popular hacking

291
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
forum and also included names

292
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,160
phone numbers addresses genders and

293
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,399
dates of birth

294
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,959
a small number of people also had

295
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,200
partial credit card data exposed the

296
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
first six and last three digits of the

297
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,399
car plus car touch and expiry and in

298
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,440
some cases the bank name account number

299
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,680
and bsp were also exposed

300
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,000
the data was subsequently made freely

301
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,160
available on the hacking photo

302
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,639
later on the following month

303
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,279
in accordance to hiv p the compromise

304
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,440
data included bank account numbers dates

305
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,320
of birth email addresses gender names

306
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,720
partial credit card data payment history

307
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,160
phone numbers and physical addresses

308
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,120
which is

309
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,560
what i said

310
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,480
okay

311
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,560
i was not able to find a specific

312
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,279
details on how the breach occur oxford

313
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,120
australia claimed that they have a

314
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,519
robust cyber security system at the time

315
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,880
of the incident

316
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,639
but it is difficult to assess this

317
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,360
statement without more information

318
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,000
as a charity that is by nature cash trap

319
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,839
it will be difficult to imagine how

320
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,240
robust that system will be

321
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,079
the bridge was discovered by bleeping

322
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,800
computer and reported to oxfam oxfam

323
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
reported the incident to the australian

324
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,880
cyber security center and the office of

325
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,440
the australian information commissioner

326
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,120
the complete conducted a complete

327
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,200
forensic investigation and the matter

328
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,440
was referred to the federal police

329
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,760
also the very nature of the work oxfam

330
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,079
does can easily be manipulated by an

331
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,040
attacker by a fishing or some such

332
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,079
attacks

333
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,920
their attack surface will be quite

334
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,160
significant due to the trust-based

335
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,839
system of their business

336
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,160
this is as shocking as it can be

337
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,360
imagined

338
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,760
but it's a lesson to us all

339
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,800
hackers follow no moral code and that

340
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,240
everyone and everything is up for grabs

341
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,800
we need to be extra vigilant to protect

342
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,959
the people closest to us

343
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,519
if anything this race should be a lesson

344
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,440
of how low these criminals are willing

345
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,160
to go to make a buck

346
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
from the report we can say that the more

347
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,680
that likely vector using was fishing

348
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,160
training is the main defense against

349
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,880
fishing there are some good tools around

350
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,440
as well that can help you defend against

351
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,320
fishing as if the company has the cash

352
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
investing of one of these tools is a

353
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
must

354
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,120
okay

355
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,480
let's finish with a big one

356
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,560
domino's pixar as i'm sure we all know

357
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,519
is a global pixar restaurant

358
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,079
the famous the famous domino's started

359
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,040
in 1960 as a pixar business between two

360
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,079
products

361
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,480
this quickly became three and grown over

362
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,160
the years to the corporation we know

363
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,360
today

364
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,120
in 1998 domino's founder retired and

365
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,639
sold 93 of the company to paying capital

366
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,519
for 1 billion

367
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
okay so what happened

368
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,320
in accordance with hiv p

369
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,560
in april 2021

370
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,760
13 terabytes of compromised domino's

371
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,560
india data appear for sale on a hacking

372
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,760
forum

373
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,600
after which the company acknowledged a

374
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,320
major data breach they take it back to

375
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,760
march

376
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,880
a compromise data included 22.5 million

377
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,040
unique email addresses named phone

378
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,880
numbers or the history of physical

379
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,279
addresses

380
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,600
hackers claimed that 13 terabytes of

381
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,160
data was stolen from domino's databases

382
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
including credit card data

383
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,720
this was put for sale for 10 bitcoins or

384
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,920
approximately 380 000 at the time of the

385
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,199
hack

386
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,959
in today bitcoin prices is approximately

387
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,120
475 000

388
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
the heart is created at public site

389
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,839
allowing people to check the details

390
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,440
finally as the hackers run the site more

391
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,120
than likely this is to further

392
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,600
compromise more data so please do not

393
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,480
use this site

394
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,480
so how did the bridge occur

395
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,240
the bridge was discovered by our

396
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,399
research called and again please forgive

397
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,240
my pronunciation

398
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,040
rashikar raja harrier

399
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,120
rashicard discovered both the site

400
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,600
selling the data and decided to confirm

401
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,480
the compromise user details russia card

402
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,000
deported to domino's india dominos took

403
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,560
a little while but they acknowledged the

404
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,040
breach eventually and took action to

405
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,320
investigate as a responsible company

406
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,560
they carried out full insulin response i

407
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,800
conducted and concluded that the breach

408
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,480
occurred due to a third-party

409
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,759
corporation

410
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,160
fortunately due to their policy of not

411
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,320
storing financial information no

412
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,560
financial information was compromised

413
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,759
also domino's india claim

414
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,839
i did not find any exact details of the

415
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,240
third party or what the vulnerability

416
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,120
exploited was

417
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,920
now let's talk about mitigations

418
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,000
how do we reduce the risk of this

419
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,519
happening to us

420
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,279
what can we learn from the domino's

421
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,320
bridge

422
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,160
unfortunately we could not find the

423
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,880
exact technical details of the bridge

424
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,320
it seems unless they are one of the

425
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,480
super famous ones they still release

426
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,800
in-depth technical details and still

427
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,560
with the details we have we can still

428
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,839
learn

429
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,199
dominoes claimed that the breach

430
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,120
occurred by a third party

431
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,199
but a mere fact that did not know it

432
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,399
occurred

433
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,199
says a lot about their own security

434
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,119
sometimes companies only care about

435
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,799
blaming someone else

436
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,679
and perhaps this is the case

437
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,599
in this case

438
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,599
but it would have been good if they

439
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,599
acknowledged their failures like failing

440
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,919
to detect that the breach was occurring

441
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,480
perhaps they have no way too but why

442
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
would a third party have access to all

443
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,480
the data

444
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,880
it is important i think in all fairness

445
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,960
to note that a business like domino's is

446
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,039
based on third parties

447
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,600
still applying a no trust policy could

448
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,520
have reduced the impact of such a

449
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,960
compromise

450
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,039
having better detection mechanism in

451
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,960
place would have helped them detect the

452
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,880
bridge too

453
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,799
there would have been lessons for for

454
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,360
the main corporation specifically how to

455
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,000
manage their third parties

456
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,559
talking specifically about third parties

457
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,240
i think the key here is to have a

458
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,559
minimum set of security standards

459
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,240
demand that is a business was to

460
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,919
interact with the network they have to

461
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,840
comply with this requirement

462
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,679
pretty much like the pci requirements

463
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,640
that credit card companies demand of all

464
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,480
the businesses performing credit card

465
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,000
transactions do

466
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,160
i imagine this is one of the reasons why

467
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,400
they didn't keep the data as pcr

468
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
compliance

469
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,559
would apply in full if they had

470
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,039
it is important to note in all fairness

471
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,679
again that domino's third parties will

472
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,799
the vast majority be a small businesses

473
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,200
with very little funding for a security

474
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,160
program

475
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
which comes to the core of the problem a

476
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,960
company like dominic's will have

477
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,440
they can demand the minimum standard but

478
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
the majority of the third parties will

479
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,559
be unable to comply the cost of a good

480
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,960
security program is significant

481
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
there is no easy way for a small

482
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,360
business to implement and manage any

483
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,240
rules

484
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,160
it is essential for the program to

485
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,120
succeed that the parent company dominus

486
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,760
in this case provide assistance and

487
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,080
resources to the smaller companies to

488
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,760
help them comply

489
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,320
also governments have a key role to play

490
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,120
in this area they need to make more

491
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,960
resources available for small bit to

492
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,720
medium businesses

493
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,280
to help them secure themselves

494
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,440
i mean we do not have security guards in

495
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,520
front of our homes we're relying on the

496
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,440
police to come and protect us from the

497
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
thieves and criminals why should cyber

498
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,080
be in a different

499
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,160
any different okay

500
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,679
okay with this image let's move to a

501
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,559
little preview this is a funny one

502
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,640
uh i don't know how we do with that i'll

503
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,120
be doing okay

504
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
i think so okay with this in mind let's

505
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,039
move to a little tibia this is a funny

506
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,320
one in march 2021 the cardi mafia forum

507
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,400
suffering a data breach that exposes

508
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,840
almost 300 000 members email addresses

509
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,000
the funny thing is that cutting mafia is

510
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,080
dedicated to the theft and trading of

511
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,840
installing credit cards

512
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,320
the forum breach also exposes exposed

523
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,280
from some of the articles i read

524
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,440
on another popular hacking forum a

525
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,679
different hacker has appeared

526
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,760
advertising the data is stolen from

527
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,480
guardian mafia the motherboard chair

528
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,880
screenshots online

529
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,960
which show that the allegedly installing

530
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,080
database was

531
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,039
990 gigabytes in size and contain 660

532
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,520
000 posts and 130 000 threads

533
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,679
the hacker was supposedly offered the

534
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,080
database for free they usually do this

535
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,640
to increase their reputation

536
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,960
although ip information could allow law

537
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
enforcement agencies to determine the

538
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,440
cyber criminal's location information

539
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,840
most hackers use vpn services to hide

540
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,440
the real internet addresses

541
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,840
hackers use untraceable email addresses

542
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,880
from providers such as mailinator to

543
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,280
register on hacking sites

544
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
novice hackers are likely to err by

545
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,840
logging in using the real ip addresses

546
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,240
or registering on the card in hacking

547
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,520
site using their real email addresses

548
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,200
commenting on the compromise of the

549
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
legal card inside forgiving my

550
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,720

founder and archie architect and

553
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
immunity says

554
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,799
most of the compromise accounts have

555
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,799
fake data and ips freedom

556
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,200
for anonymous vpns or proxies that are

557
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,919
not likely to bring much actionable

558
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,400
evidence to law enforcement agencies for

559
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,000
investigation

560
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,039
moreover even even the western law

561
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,280
enforcement agencies are currently

562
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,679
unequipped to investigate and prosecute

563
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,000
cyber crimes on a large scale i will

564
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,480
probably initiate investigatory

565
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,440
operations after the leak

566
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,520
this is important we need to face the

567
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,240
reality that these criminals most of the

568
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,720
time get away with it and the best we

569
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,880
can do is ensure that they do not

570
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,360
succeed

571
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,640
now to conclude our presentation

572
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,480
our presentation in this particular

573
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,720
slide i would like to talk about what we

574
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,080
can learn from these three incidents

575
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,919
i will now include the carry mafia one

576
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,120
on this discussion uh we have discussed

577
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,840
three breaches rachael oxfam and dominos

578
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,400
richard was the autonomous configuration

579
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
oxford due to bad luck for lack of

580
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,840
better words

581
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,559
dominoes due to third parties

582
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,799
what we have learned overall

583
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,440
for raychat follow the basic security

584
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,000
guidelines and vendor recommendations

585
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,559
ensure you learn about the security of

586
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,600
the systems you are using ensure you use

587
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,080
free resources like alwas which has a

588
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,720
wealth of information become a member of

589
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,440
the owa's chapter that usually is free

590
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,919
ask questions of all the professionals

591
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,559
that are there we are happy to help

592
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,559
when the incident happened be honest

593
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,400
less people know about care

594
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,320
help your customers secure their data

595
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,360
and prepare as much as they possibly can

596
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,159
for an oxfam a good security program

597
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,120
with good detection system is essential

598
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,360
keep good logging ensure these logs are

599
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,400
monitored

600
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,960
and ensure your people are trained it is

601
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,520
difficult to implement an ultra system

602
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,840
in a charity organization

603
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,080
but at least implement good controls and

604
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,840
limit the data available to different

605
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,600
parts of the organization

606
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,919
incidents will occur

607
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,600
doesn't matter what your company

608
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,919
business is hackers have no morals and

609
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,799
will use anything and attack any target

610
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,720
sometimes they do it for fun or

611
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,559
reputation

612
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,039
front dominoes we can take the security

613
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,440
involves all part of your business not

614
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,080
just your business but all of the parts

615
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,840
that interact with it

616
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,919
including the ones you have no control

617
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,000
over it it's important to help those

618
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,480
business that kind of protect themselves

619
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,400
and it's essential to have a good third

620
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,200
party program

621
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,840
okay here are the references

622
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,600
i was thinking putting this in a slack

623
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,000
channel after the presentation uh if

624
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,520
anyone is interested let me know i don't

625
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,799
want to fill the slack channel with

626
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,720
stuff nobody wants it

627
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,880
uh so let me know happy to share this

628
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,880
information
