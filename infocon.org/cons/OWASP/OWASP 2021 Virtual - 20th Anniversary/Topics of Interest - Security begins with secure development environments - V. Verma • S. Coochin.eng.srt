we are all glad to be here a bit about

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,960
myself and steve

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,399
oh this is what i do

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,199
spoilers

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,079
see this is spooky right so this is what

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,320
we are talking about a bit about me i am

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,520
a security relations leader at sneak and

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,559
um about uh steve steve do you want to

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,080
take it from here

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,080
hello i'm i'm one of the senior

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,680
developer advocates at sneak and i've

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
been developing code since the the age

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,600
of eight back in the days of cube basic

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,840
for those that remember it but i've yeah

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
had a long history as a or developer

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,880
origin story as a developer and now

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,080
somebody

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,320
embracing the shift left movement

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,920
next slide

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,280
uh readys we're here there we go so like

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,799
i said i've been writing code for many

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,040
many years and as a developer like even

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,799
through working through digital agency

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,479
and building out applications for big

41
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,040
organizations or organizations small big

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,280
and sometimes just some some passion

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,439
projects the thing i love most about

44
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,200
being a dev is using my developer

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,960
superpowers to be able to build

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,240
applications really really quickly click

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,759
the thing i've always been mindful of

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,600
though click

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,320
next yep thank you the thing i've always

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,840
too far

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,360
uh the thing i've always been mindful

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,759
about as a dev though is and i've

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,280
experienced this through my developer

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,079
origin story it's just what is being

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,840
surfaced in the things that i deploy

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,680
particularly building out

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,598
using open source technologies which i'm

58
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,519
a big fan of as a developer

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
all right when we talk about open source

60
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,239
code how much of a open source code is

61
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,959
being used in an organization if i talk

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,120
about uh any organization that i worked

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,040
with and even the research where it says

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,160
that 15 to 20 of the code which is

65
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
filled by an organization is a custom

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,400
code and rest of the code on the

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,120
internet is all open source code now

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,360
we're talking about open source we are

69
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,959
part of oas which is open web

70
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,120
application security project there's so

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,760
many projects and there are many of them

72
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
are being used in the uh the

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
organizations in the ecosystem and i use

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
personally a lot of them now think about

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
an application when 80 to 90 percent of

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
the code is open source

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,680
will there be a problem

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,519
there could be some problems now if you

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,920
look at the screen there are so many new

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,680
packages which are crea which are being

81
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,319
created as part of the ecosystem every

82
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,200
year like so many of them talk about

83
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,080
from may 1 central to npm to

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,159
pi pi to whatnot

85
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,760
we are seeing a huge shift from the uh

86
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
from the older ecosystem to the newer

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,200
ecosystems there are so many things

88
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
which are being developed but now when

89
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,599
they are being coming up in the picture

90
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,840
do we see vulnerabilities in them

91
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,000
absolutely aren't we seeing the breaches

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,920
that are happening now what is the

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,599
reason behind them

94
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,200
now when there's something new that

95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,440
comes up we're all excited let's use

96
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,760
this let's use this let's try this but

97
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,319
do we try and understand what exactly it

98
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,959
comes up with now when we say that then

99
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,440
comes the containers

100
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
um and

101
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,959
yeah this is something to um something

102
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,720
that's really important too particularly

103
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,400
from the development side of you side of

104
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,640
things like keeping your code nice and

105
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,439
clean and free from vulnerabilities or

106
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,760
as free from vulnerabilities as you can

107
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,239
is just part of this holistic iceberg

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,319
journey or a journey into your cool

109
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,519
stack

110
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,120
that was fun

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,200
the other part of this is also keeping

112
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
your infrastructure

113
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,560
as clean as possible too so

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,399
containerization from a development

115
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,079
point of view is amazing or from a

116
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,918
devops from a holistic tech point of

117
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,240
view containerization is amazing and

118
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,040
what now obviously very widely adopted

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,440
as we know as technologists but we're

120
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,199
also seeing the same vulnerability

121
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,800
surface inside

122
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,560
these components as well or in these

123
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
containers which kind of makes sense

124
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,160
given that they're built from the same

125
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,919
open source container open source

126
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,160
components that we see the

127
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,919
vulnerabilities being

128
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,479
surfaced in and again back to building

129
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,440
applications to for my end users it's

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,600
important to keep your infrastructure as

131
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,919
clean as possible so that well we

132
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,199
protect our end users and click

133
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,880
the way i like to think about this is

134
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
with great containerization comes great

135
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,680
responsibility

136
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,280
think about infrastructure as a code how

137
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,960
much of infrastructure as a code is

138
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,680
being used in the organization

139
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,199
lot lot

140
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,600
i want things to be spin up so fast i

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
want to make sure that i have a

142
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,199
step-by-step instruction if something

143
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,280
happens that i can spin up the whole

144
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,120
instance the whole network

145
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,639
just in one shot

146
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,120
and for the starter for the unicorns

147
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,280
they want things to be fast and not just

148
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,919
them even enterprises now want things to

149
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,320
be fast and they are running the whole

150
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,160
infrastructure wire infrastructure as a

151
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,039
code

152
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,400
now if we see some bug in that or if

153
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,039
there is a bug since the beginning

154
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,880
where things can go wrong and where

155
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,720
things can go tricky

156
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,120
like i am spinning up my network but

157
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,440
that's been vulnerable since the

158
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,479
inception

159
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,960
i am spinning up some storage space but

160
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,120
that's that is vulnerable and even i

161
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,759
don't know about it or i miss to check

162
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,720
on that

163
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
now that bring us to the point that are

164
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,880
we missing something very very important

165
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,680
here steve are we missing

166
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,160
oh we are this is the most scariest part

167
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,120
i mean the finding um finding you know

168
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,919
uh

169
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,759
attacked vulnerabilities inside your

170
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,400
stack is obviously scary enough but as a

171
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,880
developer like one of the places that i

172
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,199
i'm able to build out these amazing apps

173
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,680
is i mean that's that's my

174
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,520
that's my sacred place it's my special

175
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,479
place where i get to build experiment

176
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,479
and be able to use my developer

177
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,479
superpowers

178
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,840
dev environments

179
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
so do you want to go ahead and try

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,639
something interesting dev uh steve

181
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,199
i do um just quickly though yeah this is

182
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,919
something we're now seeing um the same

183
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,759
vulnerabilities appear in developer

184
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,840
environments which again kind of makes

185
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,080
sense given that a lot of the extensions

186
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,840
and add-ons through these different

187
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,759
development environments like homebrew

188
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,160
for example use the same components that

189
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,720
we've just been talking about um yeah

190
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,240
this is totally one of the scariest

191
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,599
demos actually there's a link on this

192
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,199
slide too if anyone wants to try it

193
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,039
themselves at home but please do not

194
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,039
leave these extensions installed and

195
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,039
we're about to show you why

196
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,840
um yes let's do the demo yes all right

197
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,039
we are here

198
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,400
so now

199
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,360
um let me go ahead and give it to steve

200
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,440
only because he's a developer he wants

201
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,599
to do something with his application

202
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,360
so steve do you want to talk about what

203
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,919
you have in your environment

204
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,800
yes uh did you want me to switch screens

205
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,919
quickly

206
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,919
as well do you wanna use yourself

207
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,680
oh i'll just use my screen because i

208
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,160
have the same setup like yours like i

209
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,240
have this visual studio board

210
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,319
and i have all the extensions that you

211
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,080
can think of like the instant markdown

212
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,759
plug-in

213
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,120
yeah then that's the one we're using

214
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,919
today so recently we published um some

215
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,919
res security research around four

216
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,319
particular plugins from the vs code

217
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,680
ecosystem

218
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,759
to give you id some idea on numbers vs

219
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,840
code has 14 million monthly users and

220
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,199
there's over 225 000 extensions in the

221
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,039
vs code ecosystem

222
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:09,840
so

223
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,280
the one in particular we're looking at

224
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,039
today is

225
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,680
instant markdown which basically as an

226
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
extension lets you open

227
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,080
a markdown file and you can see some

228
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,240
live edits in which is kind of handy

229
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,919
it's important to note here we're using

230
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,400
version 1.4.6

231
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,520
the

232
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,000
which is the um where this vulnerability

233
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
surfaced the current version 1.4.7 and

234
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,880
please update if you haven't already for

235
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,640
this particular one

236
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,120
has the vulnerability fixed because we

237
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,440
contributed back and let the the

238
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,919
maintainer know so that they could get a

239
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,040
patch in

240
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,680
um what we're doing today is that so

241
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,160
basically how this extension works is it

242
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,600
opens a socket connection by um into the

243
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,560
user's local host to be able to so like

244
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,640
i said you can see the actual extension

245
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,120
of the edits you make to a markdown file

246
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,600
you can see them live and this exploit

247
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,120
basically all this vulnerability

248
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,399
basically leverages that open connection

249
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,480
to be able to lift a file

250
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,040
doing a file traversal on the target

251
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,560
user's computer

252
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,600
so and it's the most scariest thing

253
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
about this one is it's literally any

254
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,720
file on the mac on your computer so

255
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,200
password files like you name it um

256
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
actually the first time we demoed this

257
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,440
on sneak live uh

258
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,920
our manager basically had his password

259
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,720
file from his mac uh on the live stream

260
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
visible by from remotely from the

261
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,279
attacker or the security researcher

262
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,959
security researcher faux attack i

263
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,440
receivable um so the way we're doing

264
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
that and again there's full write-ups on

265
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,839
our side and also on my github i've got

266
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,760
a example of how to walk through it and

267
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,920
how to do it for

268
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,519
research purposes

269
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,440
um can you open

270
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,600
the two files

271
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,120
um essentially there's two files

272
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,880
involved in this and

273
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,120
like i'm the demo we're just doing this

274
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,440
in php but you could do the same thing

275
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,200
in just about anything so index.php is

276
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,240
the link that the developer

277
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
the development environment opens that

278
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,040
triggers um like you can see there

279
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,959
localhost 8090 which is the exposed port

280
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,399
and then we're basically going to try

281
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,440
and grab

282
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,760
like a particular target file in this

283
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,440
case what we're doing on the target

284
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,920
computer is we're opening in from the

285
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,519
user's home directory we're opening a

286
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,519
file called passwords

287
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,279
um

288
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,040
the did you want to show the passwords

289
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,240
file

290
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,440
oh yes i am here

291
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,120
so on the on the target computer which

292
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,720
is bandana's computer she's going to

293
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,360
hack her own computer um yeah they can

294
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,040
see that there's a password file this is

295
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,600
a bit like a capture the flag demo if

296
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,480
you will

297
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,320
but yeah you can see she's got a file

298
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
we've can't touch this

299
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,440
password in just as text inside that

300
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,279
particular file

301
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,079
um yeah so that's basically

302
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,079
the attack part of it um the other part

303
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,160
is what this what this index file is

304
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
going to do or what this index script is

305
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,920
going to do is try and find that

306
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,680
particular file on the target user's

307
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,440
computer and then send it to a listening

308
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,360
post or track.php pro

309
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
listening file it's basically just going

310
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,519
to capture any post data from that

311
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,680
attack and then just store it in a text

312
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,560
file it back into the host user's

313
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,680
directory

314
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,880
um and we're just using ngrok to do this

315
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,440
steve let's show them i think

316
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,640
we've talked enough yes so here uh this

317
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,040
is my server which is like this is my

318
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
code where i want to pick up files from

319
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,279
steve's system and here i'm running a

320
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,600
php server where you can see that we've

321
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,680
been trying this we've been testing it

322
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,519
because sometimes the demo boards don't

323
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,839
shower their blessings on us and this

324
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,000
happens i think with everyone so when

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,720
they don't we have a php server running

326
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,120
and you must be thinking that php server

327
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,600
is running a local host on 8.22 i

328
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,079
totally agree but i am using an n group

329
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,000
to make sure that that's being pointed

330
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,600
to my own

331
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,800
domain sub domain like if i tell you my

332
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,040
website it is infosec wandhana.com and

333
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,120
you can see me as an

334
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,079
infusicwanderner.com everywhere on

335
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,560
twitter and on all the other places now

336
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,639
when then that's there

337
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,680
uh i'll just take you okay though this

338
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,120
where is my browser okay here you go

339
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,680
so this is my browser i'm gonna go ahead

340
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,560
and open infosec

341
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,079
oh it's open

342
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,720
so now you might want to look up but

343
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
here

344
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,639
there might be something like i have

345
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,040
told you infosec vandana

346
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,480
dot ngrok dot io will you open steve if

347
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,880
i give you as a friend like you know me

348
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,279
for a very long time now

349
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,600
i would and i think this is yeah and

350
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,680
this is part of the social engineering

351
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,440
part of this like two i think is this

352
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,360
would be done in a

353
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,040
malicious social engineering way where

354
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
you send the link to somebody and go you

355
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,240
should see this this is the funniest

356
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,440
thing ever

357
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,680
and then we open it yeah

358
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,959
oh

359
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,680
we're trying to open

360
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,560
oh you've been hacked

361
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,360
okay let's go back and see if something

362
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,079
has happened here there are things like

363
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,200
so this is my code and where i ran this

364
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,240
script where i actually asked steve to

365
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,279
open it now there was something which is

366
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,680
supposed to happen here there is one

367
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,079
thing important thing to note is that it

368
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,560
will only work if this instant markdown

369
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,600
plugin is open now as this instant

370
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,440
markdown plugin is open

371
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,480
if any of you would run here i'll show

372
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,720
you the screen there are things if you

373
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,800
see this there are changes which are

374
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,440
happening here i would be able to see

375
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,120
who is trying to access it there could

376
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,360
be hundreds of people now this is

377
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,600
locally running but think about if i

378
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
have a server set up and i am running

379
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,199
this and there are so many people who

380
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,760
are coming to it and how much of a data

381
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,240
i can pull in from here and it's just a

382
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,959
small script that i have kept on my sub

383
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,079
domain

384
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,560
wherein i can do wonders with it

385
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,040
like here i have my visual studio code

386
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,760
running and i can do anything that i

387
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,800
want and that's when if you see here i

388
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,600
was running that and here i got this

389
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,959
file

390
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,079
now

391
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,120
if

392
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,959
there are many people who are trying

393
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,800
this like on a continuous basis there

394
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,639
could be multiple files that i'll be

395
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,279
getting and similarly my server will

396
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,880
keep showing me that yes there are

397
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,240
things which are working and if you see

398
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,040
here

399
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,360
that it keeps moving on on the regular

400
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,639
interval

401
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,639
and now one important thing to notice

402
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,360
that

403
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,839
why are we talking about these uh these

404
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,120
things here

405
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,920
now the most important thing is a lot of

406
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,120
times we tend to miss out on updating

407
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,320
few things

408
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,639
it could be a plug-in could be a browser

409
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,880
could be our ecosystem

410
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,959
do we do we do we just update it right

411
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,720
away we don't even update our phone

412
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,320
right away or at times in organizations

413
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,560
there is always a patching cycle which

414
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,680
takes the time which which which after a

415
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,760
while being tested then only being

416
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,720
patched

417
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,279
um if i go back in time like a couple of

418
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
years back what happened to um to

419
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,199
equifax

420
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,120
and and it's not just the equifax story

421
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,279
it can happen with any organization

422
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,279
wherein if

423
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,040
there is a patch which has been

424
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,839
available and if we don't update it

425
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,279
right away or

426
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,519
within a period of time it we can be

427
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,680
vulnerable and there are organizations

428
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
which are still vulnerable and even the

429
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,839
individual websites we are using a

430
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,680
certain plugin from wordpress they have

431
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,240
an update and we are not updating it in

432
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,720
this case what happened we were using

433
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
this instant markdown plugin which is

434
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,639
running on 1.4.6

435
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,720
and there's an updated version but we

436
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,759
did not intentionally update it right

437
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,360
right steve

438
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,160
yeah we we totally didn't um and i think

439
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,839
that's important one of the things just

440
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,759
um some of the stuff you're saying there

441
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,959
in particular

442
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
like making sure you do those updates

443
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,199
and keep abreast of like the security

444
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,079
alerts as developers like even using

445
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,839
homebrew there's so many times that i

446
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,920
install something and then never use

447
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,880
like use it once never use it again but

448
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,199
it's important that we maybe do like a

449
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,959
spring cleaning and go through and

450
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,639
uninstall or remove the things you're

451
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,040
not using but also remember to do that

452
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,279
brew update through that vs code update

453
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,920
to get the latest version of something

454
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,000
um it's important to keep that stuff

455
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,040
updated but as as it is to remove the

456
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,880
things you're not using just to make

457
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,079
sure you keep your development

458
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,639
environment clean because we are seeing

459
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,959
like a lot more of these instances where

460
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,880
your development environment is just as

461
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,279
exposed as any other infrastructure that

462
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,839
you manage

463
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,959
oh we already hacked it

464
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,599
right we already did it we did it yeah

465
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,559
absolutely so um steve mentioned that

466
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,319
yes you can actually

467
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,520
check out this extension on this blog as

468
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,720
well as uh this these talks would be i'm

469
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,400
sure would be shared with you where you

470
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,160
can actually take a look at it that how

471
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,319
we did it but it was just one of

472
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,320
incidents that we wanted to show you

473
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,400
that things can go wrong in any

474
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,320
direction if we don't keep our

475
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,960
environment up to date and um there are

476
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,520
times when we tend to miss on things

477
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,440
like we've downloaded it but we never

478
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,960
used it but it's still part of our

479
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,160
environment

480
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
and you never know who's gonna catch

481
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,880
hold of us at what time

482
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,320
and that's when

483
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,640
be aware of what you have in your dev

484
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,039
environment right steve

485
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,080
totally need to i continually now check

486
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,840
my own local environments to make sure

487
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,160
in fact when i do this demo i actually

488
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,640
run os x inside vm because this one

489
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,080
scares me so much and i don't want to

490
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,640
install this stuff in my environment um

491
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,559
but it's just as important to be always

492
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,880
scanning as well for of course with

493
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,240
source code containers infrastructure as

494
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,080
well to making sure you keep keep

495
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,799
everything like nice and clear like as

496
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,360
as technology and people that embrace

497
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,120
technology it's important to keep our

498
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,960
end users safe like keep your

499
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,720
infrastructure nice and clean keep their

500
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,799
data safe you want to make sure

501
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,960
those users that are using your deployed

502
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,760

new environment

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,280
oh you don't know what i'm going to be

530

putting in his environment and we'll be

531
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,400

532
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,840

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,280
great

534
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,120
thank you so much everyone for listening

535
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,280
to us i know that

536
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,120
we wanted to make it spooky and we

537
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,720
spooked out in the

538
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,360
in the beginning itself so

539
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,120
these are the things which uh which

540
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,360
looks very simple but they can be very

541
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,000
very tricky if we don't manage them on

542
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,200
time with the right set of security and

543
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,280
security is not just my responsibility

544
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,520
as a security person or dev that sees

545
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,760
responsibility as a developer it's

546
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
everyone's responsibility my

547
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,000
responsibility is to understand the

548
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,080
environment and if i don't understand

549
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,320
the environment i might be bringing in

550
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,640
vulnerabilities or i might not even be

551
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,720
able to help people in resolving those

552
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,080
vulnerabilities

553
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,280
and if

554
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
as a developer steve says that it's not

555
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,280
my responsibility i can't work on it

556
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,600
because i have to work on my uh

557
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,360
development environment the custom code

558
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,120
that i'm writing on the cloud

559
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,080
environment on storage and whatnot and i

560
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,799
would not be able to do it then trust me

561
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,440
we all will be vulnerable and we don't

562
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,000
know when the hard reality will hit us

563
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,000
yep that no totally right just be aware

564
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,320
of what you're using and yeah keep those

565
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
end users safe

566
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,639
yes absolutely absolutely
