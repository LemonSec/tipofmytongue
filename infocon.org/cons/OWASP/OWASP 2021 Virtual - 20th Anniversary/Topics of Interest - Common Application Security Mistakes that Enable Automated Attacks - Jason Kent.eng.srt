2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,400
my name's jason and i'm going to be

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,880
talking about automation today

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,160
particularly i'm going to be talking

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,679
about that kind of automation that we

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,199
all can't stand

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,920
bots banging on websites

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,520
botters going out there and buying up

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,760
all the ps5s

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,320
all of the different uh permutations of

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,880
automated attacks that might be hitting

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,199
some kind of web application

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,160
so uh who am i well my name is jason

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,520
kent i've been

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,680
as uh as i was introduced i've been

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,200
walking around for about 20 years

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,800
looking at web applications and trying

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,160
to figure out

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,440
why problems exist um and so as i go

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,600
along through this journey um i've been

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,440
trying to bring my research forward for

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,239
people to see it and i try to give more

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,640
and more people education around how

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,399
they can also instrument themselves to

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,280
do this kind of work um i work for a

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
company called sequence security they're

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,120
the guys paying the bills these days uh

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,720
and my title for them is hacker in

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,960
residence but uh you know i do

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,600
adversarial views into uh customer

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,360
networks and i do research that kind of

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,439
thing

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,320
so what why do bots hit your website i

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,400
mean this is one of these really curious

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,759
questions and it's

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,240
really interesting in the way i got my

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,119
job here at sequences i worked for a

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,960
consulting company we did pen testing

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
and app work

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,680
and we had all these visitors to our

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,840
website and what had happened was a

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,159
company with a similar name to ours was

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,320
really rude to their employees and all

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,360
these bots started bombing our website

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,720
um and i instrumented ourselves with the

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
sequence solution i looked at the bots

47
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,880
and i got me very interested in you know

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
why are they here so there's some

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,799
reasons that bots show up right

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,640
sometimes it's just automatic hunting

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,320
you know i'll dig into each one of these

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,479
pieces but sometimes it's just we just

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,880
point it at the internet and go

54
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,399
and you end up landing on something

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,600
interesting

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
additionally there are directed attacks

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,200
obviously i'm just going to go out there

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,119
and try to get some information or get

59
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,720
something off of

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,000
a website or a mobile application fabric

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,400
or you know whatever that might be and i

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,239
might want to try to do something very

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,599
specific

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,800
there's a lot of sites that have

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,879
financial benefits and you know it's

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,560
often been said

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
that the reason you rob banks is because

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,879
that's where the money is um financial

69
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,760
benefits often will drive

70
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,920
someone to your website for

71
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,319
uh automated attacks we have a lot of

72
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,040
customers that do things like um

73
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,560
credit cards and gift cards and that

74
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,400
kind of stuff and and we see attacks

75
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,519
against those

76
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,000
uh platforms all the time and then the

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,720
last piece i'm gonna cover and why is

78
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,239
hot stock items those ps5s it was really

79
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,319
hard to get sneakers those supreme

80
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,159
shirts whatever whatever that might be

81
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,400
so automatic hunting is something that a

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,080
lot of us do

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
we go out and you know you've land on

84
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
some domain and you immediately start

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,360
pecking around at what are the other um

86
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,120
you know sub domains that are available

87
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,640
out here or what are the pieces that i

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,800
might find uh and if i'm on

89
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,080
www.example.com i might look to see is

90
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,760
there

91
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,120
api.example.com or api-dev or uat or you

92
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,599
know some of those things and so that

93
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,440
automating that and finding out what

94
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,360
those endpoints are

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,040
takes a lot of that work away and it's

96
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,640
really simple to do a few lines of

97
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,159
python and you're out

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,040
and

99
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,000
doing whatever it is that you might need

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
another automatic attack that you might

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,319
see is a spec search and i'm starting to

102
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,239
see more and more of this in our

103
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,640
customers they're looking for api dash

104
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,480
docs they're looking for swagger.json

105
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,560
they're they're looking for

106
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,159
all of these things that are going to

107
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,799
give them an api spec that's going to

108
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,879
allow for them uh to dig into the

109
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,000
um you know site that you have set up

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and understand what are the security

111
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,840
infrastructure pieces that are in place

112
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
and where are you missing them so if you

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,519
want to look at an interesting project

114
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,959
out there it's a good google search

115
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,400
called kite runner

116
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,120
kite runner is an automated way to just

117
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,320
do this

118
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,839
and it'll go out and go get you

119
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,600
all the different permutations of

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,440
possible spec

121
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,040
that you might have in a public

122
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,919
repository and then the last automatic

123
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,440
piece that i'm just going to talk about

124
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,080
and i see a lot of is bug bounty

125
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,479
searches people looking for oh you left

126
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,600
your you know wp admin file out and open

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,919
i can see administrators on it you know

128
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,560
give me 50 bucks um same thing with

129
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
xmlrpc.php

130
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,639
on wordpress sites i see this all the

131
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,080
time i've got a lot of customers that

132
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,800
have built um you know fully

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,040
uh deployed e-commerce platforms they

134
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,520
use wordpress as the the way it gets

135
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,960
deployed and

136
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
they're constantly being pinged for

137
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,400
these kinds of things add to that wp dot

138
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,520
json

139
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,199
which is going to show you basically the

140
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,680
spec for the site and the routes

141
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,320
and you know you've got a nice output

142
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,280
that comes out of this automatic hunting

143
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,600
we can move from automatic into directed

144
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,039
once we have a good understanding of

145
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,199
these things but oftentimes directed

146
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,840
attacks are pointed directly at you for

147
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
some reason right

148
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,080
a lot of times account takeover

149
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
i just go see you know i grab a

150
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,520
credential dump that's out there and i

151
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,000
go see how many of these credentials

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,120
exist

153
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,960
out on your site how many of them are

154
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,919
there

155
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,320
how many of them are available and

156
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,560
respond to that credential dump this is

157
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,360
why

158
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,600
enabling two-factor for your customers

159
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,440
is really important and it's a great way

160
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,759
to do it i know we all like to say well

161
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,919
it's our customer's job to enable that

162
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,759
stuff but let me tell you our customers

163
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,840
are going to keep using one two three

164
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,759
four five as their password and i think

165
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,360
it's really on us to make sure they're

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,560
protected

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
um but they're going after things like

168
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
rewards programs

169
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,400
you know spending all your rewards

170
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,319
points i i know if they got all my

171
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,639
airline miles i'd be pretty upset

172
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,720
right we'll see account take over for

173
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
things like purchasing where you've got

174
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,039
a stored credit card and a platform

175
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,880
let's pop out some

176
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,960
you know free whatever

177
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,680
widgets that we can send to our house

178
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,759
oftentimes this stuff comes from

179
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,360
credential stuffing

180
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,199
but that that is a directed attack in

181
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,479
and of itself a lot of times attacker

182
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,880
platforms will go out go validate a

183
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,520
whole bunch of a credential dump

184
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,960
and then once they have a good

185
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
validation on that

186
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
they can come back and resell those

187
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,560
credentials as validated and available

188
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,479
we also see directed attacks on things

189
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,280
like purchasing in all the inventory

190
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,919
right inventory takeover attacks

191
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,240
we also see things like seat spinning

192
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
attacks seat spinning attacks are my

193
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,919
favorite attacks

194
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,560
to talk about because they deal with

195
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,319
the most complicated thing i think that

196
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,720
you could do and that's you go figure

197
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,479
out where you can get um airline tickets

198
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,199
you take someone else's credit card uh

199
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,360
and you put a hold on an airline ticket

200
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
and then you go sell that airline ticket

201
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,479
on a black market site inexpensively

202
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,960
you get the the revenue off that the

203
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,720
credit card holder has to fight through

204
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,840
and hopefully

205
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,400
um you know the airline is going to

206
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,960
honor all of this transaction as it goes

207
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,440
it's a crazy long attack to orchestrate

208
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,199
but we do see these kinds of things

209
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,240
happen

210
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,680
but more likely you're going to see

211
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
inventory takeover attacks where they're

212
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
just simply trying to lock the inventory

213
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
up and either buy it all

214
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,919
or make it so that it's a hard time for

215
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,680
everybody else

216
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,639
you know think ps5s

217
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,720
there's often financial benefits that go

218
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,039
on with these kinds of attacks

219
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,720
and they're pointing at things like gift

220
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,919
cards

221
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,080
i recently worked with a client that

222
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,000
they had a gift card endpoint that was

223
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,400
getting hit pretty constantly

224
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,039
um and i looked and there was somebody

225
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,360
just guessing gift card numbers

226
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,960
they would take those gift card numbers

227
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
they'd run them against the value

228
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,759
checker

229
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,520
once they had the good value they

230
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
understood that that was a good credit

231
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,440
card or sorry good gift card they would

232
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,919
then take that gift card and either

233
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,479
resell it out on the black market

234
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,360
or they would just go and use it for the

235
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,000
services that they offered

236
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,120
credit card attacks i see a lot of

237
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,839
organizations now moving toward

238
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,440
we don't want anything to do with credit

239
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,360
cards we tokenize out at the edge we

240
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,640
don't want anything to do with this

241
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,559
stuff and i've seen attacks where they

242
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,799
pre-guess the tokens and attempt to do

243
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,320
checkouts

244
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,640
and sometimes it works it's a really

245
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,320
difficult attack to pull off you got to

246
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,399
have a lot of infrastructure in place

247
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,800
but if somebody wants money

248
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,399
oftentimes they'll put a lot of money

249
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,640
into it

250
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,560
and then the final thing that we see a

251
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,959
lot of and that i deal with all the time

252
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,040
is rewards points

253
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,640
either transferring them in and out of

254
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,800
your account so you lose all the rewards

255
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,720
points off of your hotel

256
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,760
or

257
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,160
airlines or whatever

258
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,320
or rewards points that can be

259
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,480
transferred for

260
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,320
physical products

261
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,920
there's a lot of companies out there

262
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,320
that sell you know various products that

263
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,880
if you buy enough of it you get one free

264
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,320
and they're after that one free

265
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,360
just another uh sort of understanding

266
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,680
around hot stock items i deal with these

267
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,720
drops

268
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,399
all the time

269
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,120
we've got several customers that do

270
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,880
you know things like sneakers and

271
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,640
consoles etc

272
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,080
and when

273
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,800
when we see these drops go out there the

274
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,959
reason that we see the

275
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,399
drops causing so much problem is

276
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,760
you know kind of

277
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,800
multiple fold but oftentimes it's like

278
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,360
poorly designed waiting rooms

279
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
the reason that you're being attacked

280
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,839
or the why that you're being attacked in

281
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,680
this hot stock item

282
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,519
is your waiting room is poorly designed

283
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,480
in that

284
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,959
first come first serve or the ability to

285
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,440
get to a checkout first is what's going

286
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,160
to get you there and you know you do you

287
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,079
know who can get out of line faster than

288
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,800
any human computers right so if you're

289
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,279
going to put me in a waiting room um i'm

290
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,920
basically going to be starting my

291
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,360
waiting room experience 100th in line

292
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,959
and the attackers are going to get out

293
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,200
of there way before i am and buy up all

294
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,720
the stuff

295
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,920
we also see hot stock items failing

296
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,560
because of automation just due to not

297
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,839
understanding

298
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,640
api channels versus web channels

299
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,800
a lot of times you can make a purchase

300
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,040
with the mobile app much more easily

301
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,079
than you can by going to their website

302
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,000
and the botters know this and in fact

303
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,079
they almost always attack the api

304
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,800
channels rarely do you see botters just

305
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,079
going in through the front door on a

306
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,399
website it's extremely rare

307
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,360
um

308
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,600
whoever can make the transaction the

309
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,040
fastest wins

310
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,120
apis are built for speed so bots win

311
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,279
just kind of as an aside

312
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,560
on this

313
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,800
if you want to look at you know

314
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,600
how human controls enable bots all you

315
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
have to do is read this tom's guide

316
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,000
article on his ps5 restock and how he

317
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,360
beat the bots

318
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,279
and my only comment on this if you're

319
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,600
re-watching this and you're slowing down

320
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,720
and actually going to go read this

321
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,839
article

322
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,680
is he only signed on three times

323
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,519
what he didn't realize is

324
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,680
using the same email address using the

325
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
same shipping address you can make a

326
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,200
hundred accounts

327
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,360
um and he could have been in line 100

328
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,160
times instead of just three times um and

329
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,880
so that's something that you know all of

330
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,760
us

331
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,519
that work in this industry and that are

332
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,040
trying to prevent these kinds of things

333
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,959
need to keep in mind

334
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,600
plus signs and a gmail address

335
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,360
if you head out to

336
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,079
my company's website sequence.ai and go

337
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,639
to our blog you'll see a blog i wrote

338
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,240
where i sat out in front of the police

339
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,320
station in my local town catching free

340
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,240
wi-fi and making valid gmail accounts uh

341
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,480
that would go through recaptcha too

342
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,519
easily

343
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,160
um so just having understanding that we

344
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,480
can act like the bots we can be a human

345
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,680
in a bots world and still win

346
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,440
is interesting but it's even more

347
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,040
interesting in the way they have to make

348
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,360
it work

349
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
so why is this automation working right

350
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,279
they're coming after us for all these

351
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,600
reasons but why does it work

352
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,680
and realistically

353
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,760
i'm going to cover a couple of you know

354
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
different aspects to this and things

355
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,920
that you probably can go

356
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,880
look at your applications figure out how

357
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
automation is working

358
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,480
and start to put mitigations in place

359
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,440
for that

360
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,120
so errors enable behavior um you've

361
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
probably seen i don't know how many

362
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,079
times uh somebody throws a tick mark at

363
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,399
a website and the tick mark dumps out a

364
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,120
bad sql message that gives up the you

365
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
know whole store

366
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,639
that really doesn't work that much

367
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,760
anymore

368
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,000
but the concepts still work

369
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,760
and those error messages were really

370
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,519
important and in fact they taught us all

371
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,519
to read error messages very carefully

372
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,040
one of the really important aspects of

373
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,880
understanding your application is

374
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
looking at how much data

375
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,040
transfers back and forth and if you have

376
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,160
too much information in your api

377
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,120
then you're going to enable behaviors

378
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,120
things like forgotten endpoints really

379
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,600
simple stuff right very simple

380
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,360
i just forgot that that one's out there

381
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,639
and i'm going to give you some examples

382
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,160
that you can look for

383
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,000
when you're looking at your own

384
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,959
endpoints these days um and then i'm

385
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,720
going to talk about user behavior

386
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,639
because in addition to the

387
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,320
infrastructure that a bot attack is

388
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,680
going to use and in addition to the

389
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,839
credential set and all that

390
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,440
what you're really going to notice in a

391
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,760
bot attack is their behavior how they

392
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,120
behave

393
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,000
and having assumptions on user behavior

394
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,079
is going to drive your application to

395
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,360
function really in a certain way

396
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,720
so

397
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,320
there's a little small on a screen but

398
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,959
basically uh i went to a website i went

399
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,480
to sign up um so i signed up for uh this

400
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
service and then i went back and i

401
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,000
filled the form out again

402
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,480
having already had my email address in

403
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,279
here and you can see it says that

404
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,959
email exists

405
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,279
so what does that tell an attacker well

406
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,880
this tells an attacker that i can do

407
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
credential validation right here i can

408
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,079
go validate usernames very easily

409
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,560
and you can see that the round trip on

410
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
this isn't very big

411
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,240
because i haven't filled out anything

412
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,639
else on this page all i did was stop

413
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,920
typing

414
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,760
and it went and validated and gave me

415
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,320
this so once i figure out how to inject

416
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,079
onto this endpoint i don't even need the

417
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,360
web page anymore i can just set up burp

418
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,839
or zap and i can go run against this

419
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,120
thing with a giant list of usernames so

420
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,680
having this really simple thing of well

421
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,399
that email already exists

422
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,480
makes it so that an attacker knows where

423
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
the user accounts are for this thing and

424
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,000
if i've got a big credential dump that

425
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
i'm doing validation on i'll run through

426
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,440
these first then run through the

427
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,199
passwords on them

428
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,600
on the authentication screen and then i

429
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,839
have a valid credential set or at least

430
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,519
i have an understanding if it's valid or

431
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,759
not

432
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,519
once we move into actually interacting

433
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,519
with the application

434
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
you're going to see that there's a lot

435
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,560
of information that gets dumped out in

436
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,800
api exchanges

437
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,120
and in regular web traffic exchanges and

438
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,480
i'm going to go over a couple of

439
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,320
different examples here one of them in

440
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,839
some recent research i did on a 2 000

441
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,160
customer

442
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,000
platform that allows for you to join the

443
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,800
community for one of these customers

444
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,680
but i can jump from community community

445
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,880
just by

446
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,480
manipulating what it looks like a sql

447
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,959
statement but if we look at what i'm

448
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,320
getting at here i have all of the routes

449
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,720
that are available to things on the back

450
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,360
end here so now i can start with this

451
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,519
list of what's back there

452
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,480
you know a long time ago when we first

453
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,040
started looking at api security our

454
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,279
biggest problem was we couldn't there's

455
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,199
no hrefs there's no

456
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,680
uh internal

457
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,839
thing that's going to tell me what is

458
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,079
available but now that i can find the

459
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,399
routes that are available or now that i

460
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,519
can find

461
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,839
um you know different permutations of

462
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,040
the the things that are uh paths inside

463
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,360
this application it makes it really easy

464
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,680
for me to run a scanner against this and

465
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,519
as an adversary you probably don't want

466
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,759
me running a scanner against this but

467
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,959
it's true

468
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,600
if we look at the example on the right

469
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,279
this is uh from

470
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,959
some research i did with a company

471
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,799
called ciao now

472
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,000
if you

473
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,359
were paying attention during the

474
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,199
pandemic at all you noticed that all of

475
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,199
a sudden you could order anything from

476
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,720
everyone and they would bring it out to

477
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,119
your car

478
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,439
chow now toast all these

479
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,679
point of sale organizations started

480
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,480
layering in support for having a website

481
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,400
having a mobile apps that make it easy

482
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,679
to order

483
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,439
and if you go look at the communication

484
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,440
that comes out of that stuff

485
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,160
it's got a lot of information in it gps

486
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,200
coordinates to the place its address uh

487
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,520
phone number contact information and

488
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,679
ciao now it actually tells you what

489
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,240
level they are with ciao now

490
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,480
processor keys there's all kinds of

491
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,640
great information that's inside of this

492
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,559
i've disclosed this to chow now they've

493
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,240
told me that it's nothing that i need to

494
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,600
be worried about it's all public

495
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,960
information

496
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,799
so here we are in the public having a

497
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,640
chat about it

498
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,559
in addition to them

499
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,559
this organization lithium

500
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,000
uh i

501
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,720
was testing a new tool that i'm gonna

502
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,039
talk about at the end of this talk um we

503
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,360
were testing this new tool and i noticed

504
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,679
that when i logged into fitbit's

505
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,880
community

506
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,120
i got this really weird

507
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,440
uh search query that came out you can

508
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,000
see it's you know this kind of odd

509
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,240
alphanumeric string

510
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,039
and then it says select splat from

511
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,080
you know

512
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,120
users wear blah blah right

513
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,440
i can take this information and start

514
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,840
manipulating it and if you actually look

515
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,280
at the query

516
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,320
as it appears on the screen

517
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,160
in the upper left

518
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,240
this is just the query that occurs when

519
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,880
you finish your authentication i went

520
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,720
ahead and said well instead of the

521
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,320
profile id that returns my information

522
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,520
i can just set that profile id to one

523
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,760
and maybe i can get the first user which

524
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,480
is typically the admin user um and then

525
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,600
of course you know that worked um and i

526
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,000
got a bunch of information back so what

527
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,280
i could do here is start to manipulate

528
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,480
the query strings inside of this and

529
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,799
what i ended up doing was taking this

530
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,080
query

531
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,799
and looking at that really strange

532
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,200
string that was at the front

533
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,440
of the query this one that's xm nuz etc

534
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,280
and i thought well i wonder what that is

535
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,400
and so

536
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,240
i looked at lithium's dns entries and

537
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,160
recognized that this one was in there

538
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,080
and i surmised that well maybe this is

539
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,799
how you get to this particular

540
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,360
multi-tenanted platforms tenant

541
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,240
um and i can do this select splat where

542
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,960
id equals one and i get the first admin

543
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,039
and then over here in this query i set

544
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,039
the profile id to one for the admins

545
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,000
account

546
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,799
but i change the query to a different

547
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,559
community and this this is roku's

548
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,760
community

549
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,400
um i used the same authentication that i

550
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
had for fitbit it was exactly the same

551
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,720
token structure all i changed was this

552
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,760
and the query and i got back fitbits

553
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,080
first user which is also the admin user

554
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,840
i say this is too much information in

555
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
your apis

556
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,200
and i say that i don't think that it

557
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
should work this way

558
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,039
and so i went through a 90-day ex

559
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,039
responsible disclosure with these guys

560
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,039
it ended up it ended on the 22nd of

561
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,520
august so we're a month away from that i

562
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,039
just published big blog posts about it

563
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,480
so if anybody's worried that no one

564
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
knows about this they know about it they

565
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,200
sent me several emails telling me that

566
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,679
this is not an authentication bypass and

567
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,480
that that isn't a sql statement and that

568
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,840
everything's fine

569
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,880
uh so it's a great example to use

570
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,559
because i can keep poking around thing

571
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,280
and

572
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,600
you know keep getting data

573
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,760
so in addition to the errors and a

574
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,520
little bit too much information coming

575
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
out we're talking about forgotten

576
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,159
endpoints right iterate through your

577
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,320
endpoints in your applications and your

578
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,840
apis that you have for mobile

579
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,320
applications and take a look and make

580
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,120
sure that if version two comes out don't

581
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,520
leave version one on

582
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,440
oftentimes when you re-version you're

583
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,520
increasing security or you're doing some

584
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,880
kind of check

585
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,360
to make things work in addition to this

586
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,840
sometimes you know these queries

587
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,159
um they land on like v1 slash

588
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,240
but check it without the slash we just

589
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,400
recently had a customer that had big bot

590
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,919
attack coming in because it was hitting

591
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,240
an endpoint that was without the slash

592
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,640
and they weren't paying attention to it

593
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,840
look for obvious stuff right wp.json's a

594
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,360
great one if you're using a wordpress

595
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,000
site p12 files i mean there's all kinds

596
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,760
of different things that are out there

597
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,679
um that could be dangerous if somebody

598
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,520
can read them

599
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,679
and this last little piece i'll pause it

600
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,919
for you to think about and and what's

601
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,360
driving some of this automation is

602
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,200
we have assumptions about how a user is

603
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,039
going to work so

604
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,919
should

605
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,320
one user come from 247 different ip

606
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,120
addresses probably not right

607
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,520
should the user agent string for chrome

608
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,840
be found in your mobile app flow my

609
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,600
guess is no

610
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
and those are really simple things to

611
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,520
identify what's hitting the mobile app

612
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,559
streams

613
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,480
um should everyone in the world be able

614
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,080
to get to your site i work with a lot of

615
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,919
regional customers that they don't need

616
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,240
everybody to get to their site so one

617
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,400
example of an attack that i saw just

618
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,760
this week

619
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,240
this client ip address hitting all of

620
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,080
these weird endpoints

621
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,640
i'm using this weird user agent a little

622
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,400
client if anybody knows what this is hit

623
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,120
me

624
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,679
later on in the slack and let me know

625
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,240
but this is 350 requests in two weeks

626
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,919
this is dribbling in

627
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,480
right but it's going to all these php

628
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,720
endpoints that are possibly wordpress

629
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
vulnerabilities and it's just trickling

630
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,760
in like that um this if you look at it

631
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,559
is regional uh to china

632
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,520
so

633
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,440
this customer doesn't operate in china

634
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
so there's no reason that they would be

635
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,880
coming after them

636
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,120
this automation is hitting them and i

637
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,360
see it every night

638
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,000
another example of this is i've got a

639
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,600
customer where

640
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,280
they're constantly getting these kinds

641
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,799
of requests where it's going to order

642
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,360
endpoints uh looking for orders that

643
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,799
that may have been filled or may not

644
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,200
have been filled and

645
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,520
this may not be sequential and it's not

646
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,360
really all that obvious

647
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,679
um but half of these requests this this

648
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,520
is half of the requests that came in in

649
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,440
a 20 minute time span

650
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,360
from two ips

651
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,240
this is really strange right um

652
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,080
oftentimes this is like a customer

653
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,520
service center or something like that

654
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
that's generating this kind of traffic

655
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,799
but that's not the case here um because

656
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,640
all of these if you

657
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
know the client and you you go into

658
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,880
everything um all these orders were

659
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,559
being shipped to places all over the

660
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,320
world no reason should be coming from

661
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,760
two different ip addresses if they're

662
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,200
not customer service center and it

663
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,360
wasn't

664
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,120
so some cautions

665
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,400
for you out there

666
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
um i alluded to

667
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,480
your spec documentation being available

668
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,120
um i just went and into google and i

669
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,360
typed in url semicolor colon api docs

670
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,960
and i got back

671
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,880
10 pages of stuff but here's some

672
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,120
interesting ones github for amazon if

673
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,799
you're a selling partner

674
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,640
has all of their api documentation

675
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,559
available to you lets you know how to do

676
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,080
it everything you need to know

677
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,919
bigcommerce

678
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,919
what their api status codes look like

679
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,279
etc

680
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,600
there's lots of swagger files

681
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,840
that are available out there

682
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,039
so when you want to

683
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,559
harden yourself a little bit to these

684
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,080
automated attacks

685
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,600
something that you really want to look

686
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,000
for now especially

687
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,320
is do you have spec documentation

688
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,720
available is it even available and if it

689
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,279
is are you using it for your security

690
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,520
products you can instrument a lot of

691
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,799
security products with spec

692
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,480
documentation these days

693
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,120
just don't put the documents in a public

694
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,000
place

695
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,320
because attackers are grabbing them

696
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,080
and they're doing what they want to with

697
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,559
them and it's a it's becoming an

698
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,080
interesting time for that spec

699
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,760
documentation where we were all pushing

700
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,640
for a few years ago

701
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,120
go teach yourself um take a look at the

702
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,960
things that you have google for your

703
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,200
docs look for your api documentation on

704
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,840
your site site colon and your e and your

705
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,400
um

706
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,200
your top level domain will lock down the

707
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,919
google search just your tld

708
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,840
look for errors in your apps the errors

709
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,440
should not give me more information to

710
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,600
make the attack work better

711
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,440
run your mobile apps through proxy are

712
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,679
you pinning your certs are you doing the

713
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,200
things that you should be just to make

714
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,120
it harder for an attacker to look at

715
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,120
this stuff

716
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,640
look at your logs

717
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,799
unless you don't have logs and then you

718
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,240
should get logs you should have

719
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,840
something to consume them and be able to

720
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,000
search through these things and the last

721
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,120
thing i'm going to give a little pitch

722
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,520
to owasp crappy project i really love

723
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,960
this project you're doing anything with

724
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,400
apis

725
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,919
running through the challenges on this

726
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,440
is going to teach you quite a bit and

727
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,200
getting your developers to run through

728
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,679
these is going to help them understand

729
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,840
the things that they need to

730
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,919
last piece here is be on the lookout

731
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,240
we're going to be launching a product

732
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,720
that you'll be able to use for free

733
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,480
that will go look for all of the

734
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,000
endpoints that you might have hanging

735
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,039
out there

736
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,720
and we're going to be putting in things

737
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,480
like being able to find if you have spec

738
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,159
documentation out in the public and that

739
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,520
kind of stuff so it's a discovery

740
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,279
service we're starting to bring it

741
