00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,359
the electronic frontiers foundation

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,320

um

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,640
i've got to use a little bit of a

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,640
personal story here and uh

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,600
i first met eva at nalcon and goer india

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
and she just completed a talk cyber

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,520
security and privacy from the global

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,840
lens uh if you do have the opportunity

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,440
please go and review it

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,480
um after the talk i i stood around and i

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,079
wanted to ask her some questions but

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,520
there were just so many people around

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,120
her because you know she's a rock star

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,719
of our industry

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,960
and i just felt you know what i'll catch

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
up later and i never did and i really

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,480
wish i'd stuck around

31
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,080
um one of the things that he was really

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,280
passionate about and it's actually one

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,960
of my passions as well is actually the

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,119
illumination of stalkerware uh you might

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,880
have seen on my twitter feed retweeting

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,400
some of the work that it has done in

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,280
this area and it just has to go there's

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,040
no place for this type of software in

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,200
civil society it should be illegal

40
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,240
everywhere

41
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,960
stalkers use it to spy on and abuse

42
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,000
victims

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,960
they

44
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,360
use it for domestic violence they kidnap

45
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,439
kids and they murder people there is

46
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,840
absolutely no there is no room at all

47
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,920
for this type of software please review

48
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,360
her ted talk literally her ted talk

49
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,240
um

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,600
for what you need to know about stalk

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,759
aware and take immediate action i really

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,640
do encourage you to do that

53
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,880
part of oos is ethics

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,880
and our ethics do not allow that type of

55
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,680
software to exist please get rid of it

56
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,000
either gopro is efs director of cyber

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,119
security prior to 2007 uh either worked

58
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,119
in security and it in the silicon valley

59
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,640
and in degrees in political science and

60
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
international relations from sf's su

61
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,200
who work primarily focused on providing

62
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,719
privacy and security for vulnerable

63
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,878
populations around the world to that end

64
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,479
she's applied the combination of her

65
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,599
political science and technical

66
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,200
background to everything from organizing

67
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,680
efs tour relay challenge to writing

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,200
privacy and security training materials

69
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,360
including surveillance self-defense and

70
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,120
the digital first aid kit which i

71
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,280
actually have referenced to people

72
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,200
um it's a really important document and

73
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,480
if you're not familiar with it please go

74
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
and look it up

75
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
she also published research on malware

76
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,200
in syria vietnam and kazakhstan

77
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,720
when she's not collecting new and exotic

78
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
malware she practices as aerial circus

79
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,959
arts and learning new languages and with

80
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,560
that eva thank you and take it away

81
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
aha

82
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,120
thank you so much for having me and

83
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,280
reminding me to unmute myself

84
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
i also deeply regret that i did not get

85
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
to meet andrew at nalcon

86
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,800
especially since i went back the year

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,720
after and essentially gave a a repeat of

88
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,239
the same talk

89
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,560
with fewer technical difficulties

90
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,480
but that particular talk

91
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,200
largely had to do with a sort of um

92
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,080
overview of stalker ware all over the

93
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,959
world

94
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,519
uh this is uh not what i'm here to talk

95
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,760
to you uh or sorry it was a overview of

96
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
like apts all over the world anyway that

97
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,599
is not what i am here to talk to you

98
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,760
about today uh i

99
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,440
did a uh a conversation at ucla just a

100
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,280
few days ago uh at an event that they

101
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,159
called

102
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,640
something like ethics in cyber security

103
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
and i had suggested that we simply call

104
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,879
our conversation ethics in cyber

105
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,360
security you should have some

106
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,640
uh they would not do that uh presumably

107
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,400
because there was just a limit to the

108
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,319
amount of stark that they were they were

109
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,440
willing to put up with from me but uh

110
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,959
now i have uh i have an hour to myself

111
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,920
and i get to say whatever i want so

112
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,480
there and i'm going to talk a little bit

113
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,280
about how we should have ethics in cyber

114
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,439
security and specifically what i want to

115
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,319
talk to you about is who deserves cyber

116
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,400
security and how we can expand our ideas

117
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,040
about who deserves cyber security um so

118
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,759
when we think about cyber security uh we

119
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,160
think about uh the practice of

120
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,360
protecting systems networks and programs

121
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,840
from digital attacks and when we think

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,560
about who cyber security is for cyber

123
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,600
security is usually thought of uh

124
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,320
especially in an academic setting where

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,560
you were being taught cyber security is

126
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,440
for governments you have great big

127
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,520
arguments about cyber security policy

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,280
what kind of rules should we have we

129
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,400
have our arguments about uh cyber

130
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,520
security for companies uh about you know

131
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,840
locking down your your fortune 500

132
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,639
company or creating cyber security

133
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,919
products

134
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,080
cyber security often focuses on

135
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,240
protecting people and institutions with

136
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,400
power and money

137
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,880
for the same reason that jesse james

138
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,840
robbed banks it's where the money is uh

139
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,120
notably

140
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
what cyber security isn't

141
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,919
is

142
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,080
it's not the practice of protecting

143
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,199
people

144
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,720
so i'm going to talk about the ways in

145
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
which this approach to cyber security

146
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,320
has kept us from addressing important

147
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,720
harms and i'm going to talk a little bit

148
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,800
about my vision about of what cyber

149
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,199
security could be and to talk about what

150
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,520
you as cyber security professionals can

151
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,479
do in order to make that vision

152
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,720
a reality

153
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,360
so i'm going to start uh actually

154
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,440
referencing the the talk that i gave at

155
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,160
nalcon i'm going to start with apts

156
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,320
so apt is

157
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,440
short for advanced persistent threat

158
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,400
and

159
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,120
usually when we are talking about apts

160
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,800
we are talking about government or

161
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,560
government aligned actors uh the reason

162
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,280
why apts get you know sort of their own

163
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
designation and they are considered to

164
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
be a particularly interesting and sexy

165
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,479
thing to study

166
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,160
is that apts behave very differently

167
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,160
from hackers or ransomware gangs or you

168
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,319
know sort of run-of-the-mill

169
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,520
criminals

170
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
you can watch

171
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,560
apts come to work they they make it

172
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,720
their job to essentially probe your uh

173
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,800
your perimeter for weaknesses and you

174
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,280
can see that in the very first apt

175
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
report which i think was put out by

176
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,440
mandiant they put out the apt-1 report

177
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,080
in 2013 and it described years of work

178
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,240
by a

179
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,759
group of uh government hackers located

180
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,960
in china and it focused on the work that

181
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
they were doing to

182
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,080
uh compromise the new york times so they

183
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,680
spent all of this time targeting the new

184
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,120
york times and the reason that they were

185
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
targeting the new york times as an

186
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,360
organization was that they wanted to

187
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,360
unmask the identity of uh

188
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,800
some

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
sources on

190
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,720
stories about chinese government

191
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,240
corruption i if you are familiar with

192
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,840
chinese politics

193
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,240
you are probably aware that the reason

194
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,759
why the chinese government was so

195
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,199
interested in

196
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,599
discovering the identity of the of the

197
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,120
sources for these stories on corruption

198
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,720
was not because they wanted to give them

199
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,960
a prize and not because they wanted to

200
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,919
bring them cookies uh their intentions

201
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,560
were uh were definitely

202
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,240
let's just go with bad

203
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,520
i and it was extremely important that

204
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,599
the that the new york times you know

205
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,440
sort of step up its privacy and security

206
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,400
game

207
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,919
in order to protect these important

208
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,000
sources because people's lives

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,160
were on the line

210
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,639
and what followed over the next several

211
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,039
years were a series of other reports

212
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,039
about apts about sort of uh persistent

213
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,639
government actors uh and usually these

214
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,360
reports focused on um russia

215
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,960
sometimes on israel sometimes on china

216
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,160
there were

217
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,240
reports later on

218
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,800
actions by north korea

219
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,879
you saw a lot of

220
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,720
interest in the behavior of actors from

221
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,520
from the five eyes countries which are

222
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,440
the united states

223
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,200
canada new zealand australia

224
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,000
and uh and the uk um so all of that was

225
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,599
extremely interesting to people and the

226
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,279
reason that this stuff was interesting

227
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,480
is because those actors are

228
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,959
sophisticated because they're you know

229
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,279
largely bringing their a game

230
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,920
uh at the at the time when a lot of

231
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,720
these uh sort of apts were first being

232
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,640
tracked they weren't exactly like making

233
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,920
use of of oday's left and right um but

234
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,560
they they were using some sophisticated

235
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,000
techniques and the reason why security

236
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,040
companies

237
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,399
published reports about these apts in

238
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,080
particular was uh also for money not

239
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,519
because you were going to pay for these

240
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,040
reports these were the reports that they

241
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,640
were doing for free but they were

242
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,440
essentially free advertising showing you

243
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,120
how sophisticated uh they were as a

244
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,080
security company our research is so good

245
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,720
that we found the nsa we found gchq look

246
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,000
at me i'm a badass we can you know

247
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,959
pinpoint these chinese actors down to

248
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,040
the building that they were working out

249
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,279
of which is a pretty neat trick

250
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,480
um so essentially the the entire point

251
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,480
is to uh is to fetishize um

252
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,839
complexity and techniques and

253
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,880
novelty uh as as part of this effort to

254
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,920
create a you know hype around around

255
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,720
your company and therefore sell more

256
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,320
products and because this was the way in

257
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,160
which so many of us thought about

258
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,079
information security uh there was a lot

259
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,240
of interesting research that simply did

260
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,399
not get published that ended up on the

261
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,880
floor or that ended up in you know very

262
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,839
obscure reports that nobody ever read

263
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,120
that turned out to actually be extremely

264
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,240
relevant

265
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,040
so starting in about 2011 2012 i was

266
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,200
traveling all over the world

267
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,680
doing trainings for journalists and

268
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,959
activists who were you know increasingly

269
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,079
being targeted by uh by all kinds of

270
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,600
government actors

271
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,079
who were increasingly living their lives

272
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,120
online and doing their work online so

273
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,279
everything was being kept in some sort

274
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,920
of digital medium i and who were

275
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,560
increasingly vulnerable to

276
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,399
various kinds of online surveillance

277
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,720
so in a moment i will i will talk about

278
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,240
exactly what those trainings were like

279
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,760
but we did notice that they were being

280
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,399
targeted by apts and the way that we

281
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,000
noticed is that i would come and i would

282
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,680
talk to journalists and activists and

283
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,360
they would say hey i got this weird

284
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,079
email with this strange attachment

285
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,560
uh you know so it's not even like i'm

286
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
writing yara rules i i'm actually just

287
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,640
being handed some malware and told like

288
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,160
this is weird

289
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,360
and i spent some time taking it apart i

290
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,800
and as a result i spent uh

291
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,079
probably about uh three or four years uh

292
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,839
just publishing reports uh about the uh

293
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,079
the apts that we found that were

294
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,079
targeting these journalists and

295
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,079
activists um and so what was

296
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,600
particularly interesting about these

297
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,200
apts uh was that they were

298
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,399
they were actors in uh in vietnam who

299
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,880
were targeting um

300
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,680
journalists and bloggers

301
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,959
lawyers uh one mathematics professor in

302
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,079
uh in australia uh the vietnamese case

303
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,600
was particularly interesting because i

304
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,079
had done some activism on the jailing of

305
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,639
vietnamese bloggers and

306
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,959
my series of blog posts was enough to

307
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,959
get me targeted by the vietnamese

308
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,200
government and they sent some malware

309
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,120
directly to me

310
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,360
i wrote it up and

311
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,000
noted their use of use of the comic sans

312
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,760
font which made it much more difficult

313
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,320
to take their malware seriously

314
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,680
um

315
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,160
so we wrote about uh about vietnam about

316
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,800
lebanon about kazakhstan about some

317
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,120
actors in um

318
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,040
in syria that were sort of uh pro assad

319
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,600
hackers that were targeting uh

320
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,320
opposition uh groups in 2011 2012 so the

321
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,639
sort of early days of the syrian civil

322
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,519
war

323
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,200
and the reason why

324
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,600
uh these actors had not gotten any

325
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
attention before uh i had not before i

326
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,880
started doing this work but before a

327
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
fairly small number of people started

328
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,519
doing this work uh was that the

329
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,680
techniques were not interesting the

330
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,639
techniques were dead simple and stupid

331
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,320
there were these were you know

332
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,440
attachments with word docs and pdfs

333
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,040
there were you know

334
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,800
links uh to uh two videos that took

335
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440
advantage of extremely well-known flash

336
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,760
vulnerabilities uh we uh we saw you know

337
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,200
basically every every old and and boring

338
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,399
exploit

339
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,639
in the book but what was particularly

340
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,399
interesting about this stuff was uh the

341
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,480
analysis of the lures that they were

342
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,760
using which were designed to be

343
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
very compelling to the people who were

344
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,600
doing activism in these particular

345
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,839
spaces so it was a lot of stuff like

346
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,320
a an actor would uh would compromise a a

347
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,720
facebook group then they would start

348
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,000
seeding the facebook group with links to

349
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,480
a fake youtube page uh that is supposed

350
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,320
to contain uh you know videos of assad's

351
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,000
depravities

352
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,680
so again very uh very simple techniques

353
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,000
but extremely effective and what

354
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
mattered more than anything else was uh

355
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
that the stakes were very high

356
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,160
uh we

357
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,760
saw that

358
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,920
people who were being targeted with this

359
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,519
kind of malware

360
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,800
were being picked up by assad's uh

361
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,320
security forces and never seen again

362
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,040
we

363
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,600
we know that vietnam again very famous

364
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,480
for uh for jailing journalists and

365
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,240
activists and the the links to

366
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,760
between the behavior of the apt between

367
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,880
the being targeted uh for surveillance

368
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,120
and violence were

369
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,519
increasingly clear

370
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,600
but again nobody paid attention and the

371
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,120
reason that they did not pay attention

372
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,199
was because the text the techniques were

373
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,760
not interesting and the stakes if you

374
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,160
were an information security person

375
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,920
seemed to be very small uh they were not

376
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,720
um attacking the new york times which

377
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,199
has a lot of money which then went ahead

378
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,959
and put a lot of money in just securing

379
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,399
its newsroom uh most notably hiring uh

380
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,639
rena sandovic from tor

381
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,839
who i think ran uh security at the new

382
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,959
york times uh newsroom for many years

383
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,560
and uh

384
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,199
we also started seeing other

385
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,759
um news organizations come up that

386
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,560
touted their extremely good security

387
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,120
teams and security practices most

388
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,959
notably bloomberg

389
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,600
bloomberg was ahead of the game in terms

390
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,399
of securing their newsroom because they

391
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,279
are essentially uh they were financial

392
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,120
reporters and it turns out that there is

393
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,360
a lot of money in protecting financial

394
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,880
data online uh so they were they were

395
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,800
doing this before everybody else and

396
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
then you know sort of later in the game

397
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,399
uh around the time of the snowden

398
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,399
revelations we started to see

399
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,199
organizations like uh the intercept

400
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,600
which was founded by billionaire or

401
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,560
funded by billionaire pierre omidar uh

402
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,440
and

403
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
they also made a big deal of having you

404
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,000
know this sort of roster of rockstar

405
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
cyber security people uh who were

406
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
working for them

407
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,040
to you know varying levels of

408
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,759
effectiveness

409
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,199
so again

410
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,160
the big problem here was that uh people

411
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,959
were not paying attention to the stuff

412
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,279
that was targeting activists or

413
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,279
journalists if they were doing activism

414
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,199
somewhere small if they were on the

415
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,199
periphery if they were freelance

416
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,040
journalists if they were somewhere

417
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,920
inexpensive if they didn't have a lot of

418
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,800
money for trainings or in order to buy

419
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,519
tools these are not the people who

420
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,519
interest a company like mandiant uh

421
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,839
because there's just there's no money to

422
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,880
be made in uh in protecting them and

423
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,720
that's one of the reasons why these

424
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,079
reports uh were written by by me and

425
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,720
also by you know i would say about half

426
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,919
a dozen other colleagues in the space

427
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,319
who who took an interest in doing this

428
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,480
sort of thing and why no one had done it

429
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,599
before

430
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,760
so what i really want to emphasize here

431
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,960
is uh that we took an an approach where

432
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,039
instead of fetishizing the uh

433
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,120
how you know how sophisticated the

434
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,240
techniques were we really focused on uh

435
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,480
on the people and the people who were

436
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,000
largely being ignored were the people

437
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,080
who were without power and without money

438
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,559
so i i talked a little bit about the

439
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,480
about the work on apts and the work on

440
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,039
uh training for uh for journalists and

441
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,720
activists so journal training for

442
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,440
journalists and activists became a sort

443
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,960
of a very big deal in you know the

444
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,080
somewhere around 2010 2011 and the sort

445
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,559
of scene in which i traveled suddenly it

446
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,919
became apparent that uh that journalists

447
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,720
were under attack and that they were

448
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,400
hugely unprepared uh to protect their

449
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,799
sources or themselves

450
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,120
i once asked npr journalist andy carvin

451
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,960
who had become famous for being able to

452
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,760
do

453
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,919
really interesting work in syria at the

454
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,080
time journalists were not allowed into

455
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,200
syria and so he did um nearly all of his

456
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,280
work well i guess all of his work uh

457
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,480
with using sources inside of syria that

458
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,280
he communicated with over the internet

459
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,640
i and

460
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
uh as a result lots of people were kind

461
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,520
of calling uh the um

462
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,080
the beginnings of the syrian civil war

463
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,799
the uh the skype revolution because

464
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,000
there were so many people using skype um

465
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
but i asked andy how he normally got in

466
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,520
touch with his um with his sources and

467
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,120
he said that uh the uh the exact you

468
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,440
know end-to-end encrypted communications

469
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,200
that they were using mattered much less

470
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,039
than the fact that uh that they were

471
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,320
using tor

472
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
uh that they would start with tor and

473
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,520
then they would figure out what tool

474
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,799
they wanted to use in order to

475
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,000
communicate and he was asked why and he

476
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,160
replied with all of the people i know

477
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,200
who were not using torah dead

478
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,120
so again the stakes were extremely high

479
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,200
and it turned out

480
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,400
that

481
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,520
training

482
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,919
for uh

483
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,679
for organizations like the new york

484
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,600
times or thompson reuters uh

485
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,400
became available fairly quickly and they

486
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,000
started taking their security much more

487
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,720
seriously uh very early on and they were

488
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,320
able to put a lot of money into it and

489
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,679
so they got a lot of attention but uh

490
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,080
not all journalists and activists are

491
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,760
created equal

492
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,840
there are many journalists

493
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,760
i would say the majority of journalists

494
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,640
in this world do not work for large

495
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,640
newsrooms they work as as freelancers

496
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,520
and they are entirely on their own when

497
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,280
it comes to uh

498
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,520
you know researching and filing their

499
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,559
stories and they uh at the time at least

500
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,440
were

501
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,159
uh left on their own when it came to

502
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,600
matters of digital security which was

503
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,880
very alarming

504
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,159
the same was largely true of activists

505
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,159
sure there are large organizations like

506
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,280
you know human rights watch and

507
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,880
the aclu

508
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,760
and

509
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,559
uh

510
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,640
amnesty international

511
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,320
and they

512
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,799
have many activists some of which are

513
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,480
actually part of the organization and

514
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,679
are paid and

515
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,720
they managed to move relatively quickly

516
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,400
to uh sort of locking down things for

517
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,080
the activists that they worked with

518
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,360
directly but much like journalism there

519
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,360
is a whole periphery of activists

520
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,480
who are largely acting

521
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,360
in

522
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,400
improvised groups who become activists

523
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,760
largely by accident who do not plan

524
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,000
their operational security well in

525
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,440
advance and that left them exceptionally

526
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,720
vulnerable

527
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,880
so one of the things that i did as part

528
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
of my work with the electronic frontier

529
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,080
foundation was i uh helped to revamp uh

530
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,960
our

531
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,520
surveillance self-defense guide uh

532
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,120
surveillance self-defense can be found

533
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,360
at ssd.eff.org

534
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,919
and it is essentially all of eff's

535
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,000
digital privacy and security advice

536
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,640
at the time that we started doing this

537
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,559
uh there were a lot of other privacy and

538
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,039
security guides online

539
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,400
and

540
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,440
they had a number of very interesting

541
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,520
problems that i saw over and over again

542
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,440
before i started working on this revamp

543
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,799
the first thing that i did was i took a

544
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,280
look at the entire space and i saw

545
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,480
problems uh the biggest problem that i

546
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,159
encountered was that these guides were

547
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,640
not updated so people would write a

548
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,200
guide with a you know with a list of

549
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,120
tools or a series of advice or you know

550
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
some sort of

551
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,159
sketch that tries to explain to you the

552
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,120
difference between uh you know your your

553
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
data encrypted at rest and your data

554
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,000
encrypted in transit and uh nobody would

555
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,799
update anything uh furthermore there

556
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,799
were no dates on the guides themselves

557
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,280
so you didn't even know how out of date

558
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,679
the guide was or how out of date the

559
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,039
advice was

560
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:51,919
um

561
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,679
there were also problems with

562
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,360
translation frequently these guides were

563
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,120
not translated into other languages or

564
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,720
if they were translated into other

565
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,679
languages they were translated poorly uh

566
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,480
furthermore the uh even if they were

567
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,919
translated and translated well uh often

568
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,159
we found that the

569
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,480
translations would very quickly go out

570
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,640
of date because if you make one small

571
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,559
change to your guide which is translated

572
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,400
into eight languages you then have to go

573
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,840
and translate it into your eight

574
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,400
languages

575
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,720
so those were some very serious problems

576
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,280
um but there were also two sort of

577
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,640
larger problems that i wanted to address

578
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,520
in

579
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,880
creating a version of a revamped

580
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,840
surveillance self-defense that uh that

581
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,320
would help journalists and activists and

582
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,480
really a lot of other people who are on

583
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
the periphery the people who are without

584
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,960
power and people who are without money

585
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,279
and uh

586
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,039
the first was

587
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,039
i noticed that there

588
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,000
was no discussion

589
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,640
in all of these privacy security guides

590
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,919
of threat modeling that no one talked

591
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,120
about who this guide was for

592
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,480
because

593
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,760
as we know privacy and security are not

594
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,880
one size fits all and trying to protect

595
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,360
everything from everybody all the time

596
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,039
is just a way to get completely

597
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,919
exhausted so frequently these guides

598
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,600
assumed a certain kind of

599
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,120
of reader

600
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,640
and often the kind of reader that they

601
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,799
assumed was a person like themselves

602
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,799
frequently these guys were being written

603
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,960
by you know

604
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,240
white men in their 20s located in you

605
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,600
know the united states or europe and

606
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,000
they were often

607
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,279
prone to the kinds of assumptions

608
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,360
that you see where everyone just assumes

609
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,279
that people are like themselves that you

610
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,880
have uh

611
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,720
the latest in technology that you have a

612
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,279
steady internet uh that you are probably

613
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,200
not facing uh harassment just for

614
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,919
existing um

615
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,600
so it's a it's a very different kind of

616
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,159
world and as a result there were a lot

617
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,400
of people whose needs were left out of

618
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,880
these guides i and again this was

619
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,640
because people thought about the people

620
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,600
with uh at the center with the power and

621
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,200
the money or the people who were like

622
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,120
them with the power and the money and

623
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,640
they did not think about the people who

624
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,200
are on the periphery

625
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,240
the other uh thing that i was really not

626
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,080
seeing in guides uh until about 2007

627
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,679
2008 uh this was um an approach which i

628
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,520
i really started to see

629
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,559
uh you know kind of

630
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,279
pioneered by frontline defenders which

631
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,880
was uh an approach

632
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,919
that

633
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,080
didn't talk down

634
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,480
to the people who were reading the guide

635
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,440
and that didn't treat the people who

636
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,520
were reading the guide like if you don't

637
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,760
follow my advice you don't deserve

638
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
privacy or security

639
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,120
um i really admired

640
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,760
some of the early guides that were very

641
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,720
clearly following the principles of harm

642
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,400
reduction

643
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,919
so you may or may not be familiar with

644
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,320
harm reduction uh harm reduction is a

645
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,840
is a philosophy taken from uh the people

646
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,159
who are largely working uh doing

647
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,919
outreach to drug users and uh harm

648
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,880
reduction has i think something like six

649
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,919
different uh principles but the the most

650
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,120
important thing to know about harm

651
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,279
reduction is that it accepts for better

652
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,480
or for worse that illicit or uh illicit

653
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,400
drug use is part of our world and

654
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,799
chooses to work to minimize its harmful

655
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,120
effects rather than simply ignore or

656
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,960
condemn them

657
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,480
so

658
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,039
you may be wondering what that has to do

659
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,760
with teaching

660
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,320
privacy and security online and what it

661
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,000
has to do with that is

662
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,799
just

663
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,960
substitute drugs for facebook

664
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,159
uh for example uh it was extremely

665
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,520
common for the people who are writing

666
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,600
privacy and security guides simply tell

667
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,360
people well facebook is bad you should

668
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,880
get off facebook if you're using

669
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,159
facebook and you have privacy or

670
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,640
security problems you have only yourself

671
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,200
to blame it's not like you thought mark

672
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,760
zucker zuckerberg rolled out of bed and

673
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,039
was like hey i'm going to protect

674
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,360
journalists and activists

675
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,320
and

676
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,679
that is

677
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,600
an extremely counterproductive approach

678
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,320
especially in countries like russia

679
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,000
where nearly all activism online happens

680
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,640
on facebook

681
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,120
so as a person who has who has done some

682
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,600
activism and uh who has worked with

683
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,399
activists uh extensively over the years

684
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,279
i can tell you that the the best way to

685
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,080
get

686
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,200
uh to get people on board with uh with

687
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,559
good privacy and security is to start by

688
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,360
understanding their needs and

689
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,279
not judging them

690
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,840
uh and that is what i think of as the

691
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,039
harm reduction approach to teaching

692
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,919
privacy and security online and it works

693
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,799
for uh it works for you know

694
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,960
do you use facebook it works for

695
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,360
questions like do you use and end

696
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,960
encrypted uh

697
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,679
messaging uh are you using your real

698
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,159
name on these various services you can

699
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,039
tell people what best practices are

700
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,120
but you also need to have a plan for

701
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,520
what you are going to do when the people

702
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,000
that you are teaching

703
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,279
need

704
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,360
to ignore some of those best practices

705
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,320
because they don't work for them

706
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,840
so somewhere around 20 2016 after many

707
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,120
years of working on surveillance

708
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,279
self-defense

709
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,919
it turned out that a lot of people were

710
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,240
interested in doing these security

711
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,320
trainings that i had spent so much time

712
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,919
putting together and for which i had

713
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,320
spent all this time putting together uh

714
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,039
secure security and digital privacy

715
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,520
advice

716
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,440
somewhere around november of 2016 for

717
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,559
some reason

718
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,200
and um

719
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,600
we started to put together another guide

720
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,399
called the security education companion

721
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,200
and that was really where i i tried to

722
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,120
put all of my ideas about uh about harm

723
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,960
reduction about meeting people where

724
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,360
they are about the importance of threat

725
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,480
modeling

726
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,000
i think in the current version of the

727
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,159
security education companion there is

728
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,840
even a lengthy discussion of uh how for

729
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,720
some uh for some populations the term

730
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,480
threat modeling uh is is triggering it

731
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,159
feels very threatening to them and

732
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,240
they're not receptive to it because they

733
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,000
feel that it sounds like something out

734
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,760
of the military and not like something

735
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,720
that we have borrowed uh from software

736
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,919
development

737
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:58,880
and

738
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,399
so we talk a little bit about other

739
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,000
approaches to threat modeling that you

740
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,919
might use in populations that feel that

741
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,679
way around that language rather than

742
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,720
simply saying well if you can't stand me

743
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,440
talking about threat modeling then

744
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,760
you don't deserve to learn how to threat

745
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,399
model this is simply not the not the

746
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,678
approach that we should be taking

747
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,159
so while i was doing all of this work on

748
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,520
apts and uh doing trainings for

749
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,799
journalists and activists uh it turns

750
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,760
out that uh one of the guys with whom i

751
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,880
was doing the majority of my

752
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,399
my apt reporting

753
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,320
uh turned out to be a serial rapist and

754
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,559
uh it turned out he had sexually

755
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,279
assaulted a lot of women

756
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,200
and uh there were a series of articles

757
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,399
in which

758
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,120
his survivors spoke out

759
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,399
in january of 2018

760
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,720
i read an article that interviewed the

761
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,840
survivors and

762
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
um in new zealand and one of the things

763
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,480
that really struck me about the stories

764
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,919
of the survivors was uh the emphasis

765
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,720
that they put on the security measures

766
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,799
that they were taking that all of them

767
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,799
were you know putting their phones away

768
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,679
and they had stickers over the um

769
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,720
over the cameras on their laptops and

770
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,519
they were scared they were absolutely

771
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,919
terrified of this guy and the reason

772
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,080
that they were so scared was that they

773
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,159
were afraid that he was going to

774
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,039
compromise uh their their phones and

775
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,039
their laptops and other devices which

776
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,399
was apparently a thing that he had

777
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,240
threatened to do

778
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,600
and

779
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,679
i was so angry that uh i i did what i

780
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,519
usually do when i'm mad which was i

781
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,320
tweeted and i tweeted that if you were a

782
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,559
woman who had been targeted by uh

783
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,720
by a sexual predator and you were

784
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,080
worried about uh your device that i

785
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,200
would go ahead and um

786
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,000
make sure that you got a decent forensic

787
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,720
analysis if you reached out directly to

788
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,600
me

789
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,799
and then i think i went to lunch i i

790
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,200
just sort of ignored this tweet my anger

791
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,640
had dissipated and i i was ready to get

792
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,720
on with my day and i did not expect that

793
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,200
it would be retweeted ten thousand times

794
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,039
i did not expect that i would be

795
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,159
contacted by more than a dozen people

796
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,840
per day

797
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,720
for an extended period of time

798
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,480
i

799
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,440
did

800
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,360
i think

801
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,640
approximately a dozen abuse cases every

802
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,440
day

803
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,519
for the better part of a year

804
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,039
i and the last time that i worked on an

805
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,519
abuse case from somebody who who came to

806
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,679
me because they were concerned about

807
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,679
their uh about their device having been

808
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,399
compromised uh by someone who had

809
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,600
sexually assaulted them was this morning

810
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,000
so i'm i'm still doing it uh but

811
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,120
uh

812
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,720
one of the things that i was really

813
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,159
angry about was uh that

814
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,320
a lot of the of the people who came to

815
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,200
me had uh problems that fell into two

816
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,399
categories

817
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,919
uh the first was that most people were

818
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,120
not getting compromised uh

819
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,279
in uh their their devices were not being

820
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,440
compromised uh their accounts were being

821
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,919
compromised so i saw a compromise of

822
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,799
email accounts of uh

823
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,480
social media accounts of you know

824
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,159
just just about everything if it if it

825
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,159
had a login i saw it compromised

826
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,039
and uh the good news is that we have

827
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,399
solutions

828
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,960
to the compromise problem uh we can tell

829
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,240
people to use strong passwords to use

830
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,960
the

831
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,039
password manager uh and to use the um

832
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,480
the strongest

833
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,360
uh

834
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,600
version of 2fa which is available and

835
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,359
that they are comfortable using because

836
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,599
again it's very important to meet people

837
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,119
where they are and not where you think

838
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,520
that they need to be

839
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,480
so

840
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,639
now that that is out of the way there

841
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,280
was not a lot to do for uh for the

842
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,879
people who are concerned about

843
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,719
stalkerware for the people who are

844
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,159
concerned about the

845
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,879
class of software that is commercially

846
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,399
available

847
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,079
to ordinary people for purchase that

848
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,000
allows them to

849
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,679
when when they covertly install it on

850
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,800
somebody else's device to get all of the

851
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
all of the data from that device

852
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,960
including keystrokes and screenshots and

853
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,119
phone calls and passwords and all uh and

854
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,399
if if the device includes location data

855
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,079
like our phone does because we're all

856
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,240
carrying tracking devices around in our

857
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,760
pockets now um you also have an

858
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,320
excellent way of keeping track of uh of

859
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,480
the location of a person which makes it

860
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,320
great for stalking

861
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,240
um

862
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,240
so my first thought

863
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,240
was that wait a minute

864
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,560
isn't there an entire industry

865
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,480
devoted to

866
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,200
uh building software that sits on your

867
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,960
device and tells you whether or not

868
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,440
there's something you don't want on it

869
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,240
uh

870
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,560
isn't that what antivirus is supposed to

871
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,520
be

872
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,440
and so i did a little bit of research

873
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,200
and uh i

874
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,240
tested out the you know i tried out the

875
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,760
top uh stalkerwear products uh against

876
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,359
the top antivirus products and honestly

877
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,520
antivirus did not come out looking very

878
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,560
good i i think i got on average

879
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,599
something like a 60 hit rate for the

880
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,880
latest versions of uh the most popular

881
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,960
stalker wear products for i think

882
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,720
something like the top 10 uh av products

883
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,680
that uh that i tried out

884
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
so that was disappointing

885
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,920
uh and i

886
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,359
turned around and went to the av

887
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,640
companies

888
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,880
i started with some av companies that

889
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,480
had had some uh very bad press that year

890
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,280
and such as kaspersky uh because i am

891
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,000
not afraid to pick the uh the week

892
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,800
off of the herd and i came to them and i

893
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,480
said you know hey how would you like

894
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,160
some press that doesn't suck

895
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,200
i and i convinced them to not only uh

896
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,560
scan specifically for stalkerware

897
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,520
but also to put up a specific alert that

898
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,000
let the user know that what they found

899
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,839
was not just any kind of potentially

900
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,480
unwanted program but was specifically

901
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,160
stalkerware

902
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,359
and as a result

903
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,359
my organization the electronic frontier

904
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,400
foundation uh along with nine other

905
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,200
organizations including uh

906
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,040
kaspersky and norton lifelock and uh

907
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,400
avast

908
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,160
and a bunch of other uh companies uh all

909
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,240
got together and formed the coalition

910
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,119
against stalkerware uh one of the things

911
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,800
that the coalition against soccerware

912
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,000
does is

913
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,520
we exchange samples of soccerware so

914
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,839
that everyone can benefit from everyone

915
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,079
else's stalkerware research and if you

916
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,680
take a look at uh the research from

917
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,800
uh organizations like av comparatives

918
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,800
you can see the the um

919
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,720
the detection of stalkerware uh by the

920
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,839
top av companies against the you know

921
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,040
top selling stock aware products uh for

922
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
for the last several years has steadily

923
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,880
been going up and is now uh for many

924
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,920
products in the 95 to 99 range

925
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,160
so that was an area in which we really

926
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,480
made a big difference and uh and i'm

927
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,920
very proud uh but again

928
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,000
we need to take a look at why why were

929
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,400
things like this in the first place and

930
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,800
the reason that we got to where we were

931
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
uh was that

932
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,200
av companies felt a great deal of

933
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,480
ambivalence

934
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,800
around what they thought of as dual use

935
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,280
products

936
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,560
people from av companies frequently told

937
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,119
me that because there were legitimate

938
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,000
reasons why you might want to install

939
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,160
something on somebody's device uh that

940
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,720
tracks everything that they do then it

941
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,599
might be a little bit sketchy to uh call

942
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,079
it out as malicious

943
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,920
so what i did was i got together with

944
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,200
the coalition against soccerware and

945
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,680
said listen we need to come up with a

946
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,280
definition of stalkerware that is uh

947
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,560
that is

948
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,400
really tight and uh and catchy and so

949
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
what we did was we we agreed on a

950
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,960
definition of stalkerware as uh the

951
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,720
class of software that uh is installed

952
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,520
on directly on devices uh and that uh

953
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,400
deliberately hides its presence

954
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,839
on the device

955
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,599
uh it

956
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,200
does not regularly alert the user to its

957
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,119
presence which makes it much more

958
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,320
difficult

959
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,800
to to detect and certainly much more

960
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,839
difficult to remove so we really put the

961
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,079
emphasis on consent

962
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,720
uh prior to that there was a feeling

963
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,200
that if you needed the username and

964
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,320
password um of a device in order to

965
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,480
install the software on the device

966
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,440
that

967
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,079
this was the same as having legitimate

968
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,040
access

969
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,359
i and what i did was i came to the av

970
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,640
companies and i said i don't think you

971
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,400
understand how abuse works it is

972
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,240
extremely common in abuse cases to see

973
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,200
uh that um the survivors of abuse have

974
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,240
been pressured by their abusers into

975
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,640
sharing their username and their

976
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,880
password and they said well

977
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,280
how about physical uh

978
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,760
possession of the device and i said well

979
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,680
frequently these are people who are

980
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,680
living with their abusers so they have

981
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,160
physical possession of the device and

982
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,960
they have the username and the password

983
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,079
you need to start thinking again like a

984
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,520
survivor of uh of abuse and

985
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,800
not like a you know comfortable

986
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,400
well-paid uh white man living in santa

987
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,680
clara

988
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,079
so this is one of the ways in which the

989
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,480
coalition against stalkerware did very

990
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,880
important work largely by centering the

991
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,760
needs of of people that the av industry

992
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,480
had had simply not thought about and had

993
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,720
not considered to be important

994
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,040
because honestly uh

995
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,880
survivors of sexual abuse are not the

996
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,960
first thing that av companies think of

997
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,400
when they think about who is going to

998
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,839
give their money for their products

999
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,119
um

1000
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,520
so the uh the other thing that i wanted

1001
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,720
to talk about real quick was uh that

1002
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
you can tell that a lot of the work that

1003
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,240
i'm talking about is uh has to do with

1004
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,720
speaking out uh with uh public

1005
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,440
publishing research or talking to a

1006
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,040
company and getting them to do something

1007
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,760
or forming a coalition

1008
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,240
and um

1009
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,720
there's an entire sort of class of

1010
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,280
people who do this uh bruce schneier

1011
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,359
refers to them as public interest

1012
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,680
technologists some good examples of

1013
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,640
public interest technologists include uh

1014
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,599
the researchers at citizen lab uh

1015
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,599
including citizen labs director ron

1016
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,960
diebert john scott railton bill martack

1017
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,079
um

1018
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,400
matt mitchell who i think most recently

1019
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,200
was working at the ford foundation uh

1020
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,520
who is one of the founders of crypto

1021
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,280
party harlem and uh who uh recently

1022
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,720
received from eff's pioneer award

1023
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,880
i think last week

1024
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,920
the

1025
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,960
congress has a sort of fellowship called

1026
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,560
the congressional tech fellows where

1027
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,440
they hire tech people specifically to be

1028
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,800
tech advisors to congressmen uh and

1029
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,960
essentially to to look at these problems

1030
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,319
and say hey this thing is good this

1031
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,240
thing is bad explain you know the

1032
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,440
difference between different types of

1033
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,240
encryption uh to to the people who are

1034
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,560
making these kinds of decisions and

1035
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,319
finally i would also point to consumer

1036
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,800
reports consumer reports has done some

1037
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,599
really

1038
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:39,440
groundbreaking work uh in terms of

1039
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,520
public interest technology recently and

1040
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,560
i'm very excited by what they're doing

1041
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,920
um

1042
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,520
but it is not enough

1043
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,760
to work in the public interest what we

1044
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,359
need to do is

1045
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,119
center the needs and experiences of

1046
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,319
populations whose needs have

1047
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,520
traditionally been pushed to the

1048
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
periphery of cybersecurity

1049
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,480
so

1050
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,200
explicitly that's women lgbtq

1051
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,960
populations

1052
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,200
people of color people in authoritarian

1053
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,560
countries

1054
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,960
activists without money journalists

1055
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,359
without money the homeless people with

1056
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,200
disabilities including visual and

1057
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,200
hearing disabilities survivors of

1058
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,040
intimate partner abuse

1059
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,640
and the reason why we need to do this is

1060
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,720
because as you can see from the stories

1061
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,960
that i have just told you if you center

1062
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,040
their needs when you're building your

1063
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,359
products and making your policies you

1064
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,839
will also address the needs of the

1065
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,599
comfortable 20-something middle-class

1066
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,200
white man living in santa clara and

1067
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,520
wearing a hoodie but if you build a

1068
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,839
system for comfortable 20-something

1069
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,440
middle-class white men living in santa

1070
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,319
clara and wearing hoodies then you will

1071
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,240
leave all of these other people out in

1072
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,400
the cold

1073
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,599
the good news is that we're making

1074
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:48,720
progress

1075
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,960
the white house executive order in march

1076
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,880
of this year established a gender policy

1077
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,960
council to investigate the ways in which

1078
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,880
women journalists are disproportionately

1079
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,119
targeted and silenced by online

1080
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,800
harassment which i think is very

1081
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,520
exciting um

1082
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,400
and i'm really glad to see the the the

1083
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,960
white house is is starting to understand

1084
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,440
that cyber security is not just about

1085
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,960
governments and it's not just about

1086
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,880
organizations it's not just about

1087
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,920
securing our infrastructure there are

1088
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,319
many ways in which

1089
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,480
we are really failing to

1090
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,920
give people security or privacy uh in

1091
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,480
their digital lives and that is

1092
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,839
something that i think we should really

1093
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,000
be focusing on

1094
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,560
as cyber security professionals you are

1095
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,079
powerful

1096
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,680
you're influential

1097
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,839
and the decisions that you make in your

1098
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,720
work about what you build and how you

1099
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,359
build it how it's locked down and what

1100
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,520
is important to protect and who is

1101
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,680
important to protect and what protection

1102
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,240
even looks like matters

1103
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,079
uh one of the things that i frequently

1104
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,000
hear from people who work in information

1105
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,040
security is uh well if i don't build it

1106
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,960
somebody else will build it and that's

1107
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,800
simply not true

1108
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,440
if you don't build it and also someone

1109
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,599
else refuses to build it and the next

1110
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,680
guy refuses to build it then somewhere

1111
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,480
down the line it doesn't get built

1112
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,480
uh you are the tipping point you are the

1113
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,800
person who makes the choices and your

1114
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,640
choices matter especially in an industry

1115
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,400
where uh

1116
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,960
there is a tremendous labor shortage and

1117
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,800
so your your labor is precious don't use

1118
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,000
it to do evil things

1119
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,520
so together

1120
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,280
my hope is that we can build a

1121
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,079
cybersecurity practice that focuses on

1122
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,560
the needs of people and specifically the

1123
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,880
needs of people on the periphery because

1124
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,800
that is the only way we're ever going to

1125
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,440
move beyond perpetuating the existing

1126
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,640
inequalities in which we are all stuck

1127
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,880
thank you very much thank you for your

1128
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,920
time

1129
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,720
i will now take questions

1130
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,640
thank you that was very very informative

1131
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,599
um i was going to ask you know beyond

1132
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,440
just simply getting this sort of cyber

1133
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,800
security

1134
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
practice going for the folks who have

1135
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,720
generally been left out are there any

1136
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,400
actions that you can take

1137
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,119
uh with your local politicians or

1138
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,560
um

1139
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,640
similar that can help make

1140
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,720
like stalk aware go away or at least

1141
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,839
become so

1142
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,119
socially unacceptable that it is

1143
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,800
becomes less of a problem

1144
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,839
well there's actually a really

1145
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:32,960
interesting thing that's happening in

1146
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,200
stock aware right now uh latest stock

1147
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,319
aware news

1148
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,520
uh the first is that i think it was

1149
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,880
two weeks ago the ftc issued a ban on a

1150
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,520
stalker ware company called spy phone

1151
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,680
they issued the ban on the company

1152
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,680
itself on its parent company support

1153
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,680
king and also

1154
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,839
directly on its ceo and this is the very

1155
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,839
first time that the ftc has issued such

1156
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:56,880
a ban

1157
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,079
they are currently in a

1158
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,000
30-day comment period so you can

1159
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,119
actually comment to the ftc and let them

1160
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,040
know that this is the sort of thing you

1161
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,520
want to see them doing

1162
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,920
there is also uh an additional bit of uh

1163
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,400
latest uh soccerware news which is uh

1164
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,079
that there's a company called pc

1165
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,280
tattletail

1166
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,160
um and uh i think

1167
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,000
vice broke this story yesterday that uh

1168
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,559
in addition to making stalker where pc's

1169
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,640
uh pc tattletail does not mix dockerware

1170
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,599
very well

1171
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,119
and it was possible to go through its

1172
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,960
cnc uh

1173
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,960
and all of the content that they were

1174
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,520
exfiltrating from uh from people's

1175
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,880
devices simply by incrementing a url

1176
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,520
so that's not very secure

1177
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,319
i and it would be a good idea to write

1178
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,640
to the ftc and make them aware of this

1179
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,760
case

1180
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,640
because if companies like like spy phone

1181
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,200
are unacceptable surely companies like

1182
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,400
pc tattletail are unacceptable as well

1183
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,520
so i think that the ftc approach is uh

1184
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,559
is very very strong right now

1185
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,200
the other thing that people can do is

1186
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,800
actually peer pressure it turns out that

1187
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,160
a lot of

1188
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,040
people

1189
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,520
seem to think that spying on their

1190
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,720
partner's phone uh or other device is

1191
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,839
somehow okay that it's justifiable that

1192
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,359
it's not harmful

1193
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,559
uh often i hear that it's justified if

1194
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,960
you think your partner is cheating or if

1195
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,520
they have done something bad to you uh

1196
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,319
and i think we really need to stop

1197
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,440
thinking about uh stalkerware as

1198
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,000
software that leads to abuse and to

1199
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,480
understand that the surveillance itself

1200
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,040
is abusive uh if you have reached the

1201
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,880
point where you are doing this kind of

1202
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,119
surveillance of your partner you already

1203
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,960
know what you need to do and it's not

1204
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,680
spy on your partner it's dump them dump

1205
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,400
them before they turn you into an abuser

1206
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,520
yeah

1207
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,680
so a personal experience of mine was my

1208
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,920
wife wanted to put some a similar sort

1209
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,599
of piece of software it's very common in

1210
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,280
families i think it's called life

1211
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,520
something or another

1212
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,400
anyway i don't want to advertise it um

1213
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,480
and i was extraordinarily upset with

1214
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,480
that and i explained exactly how those

1215
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,760
products are used to control um children

1216
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,040
you know i think you and i are probably

1217
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,559
lucky enough that we weren't controlled

1218
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,040
in that way people were you know

1219
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,200
respectful of not looking in your diary

1220
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,599
or your journal but they seem to think

1221
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,839
nothing of spying completely on their

1222
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,200
children

1223
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,319
what are your thoughts about that

1224
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:39,680
i

1225
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,720
hesitate to tell parents just like oh

1226
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,640
just let your children run feral and

1227
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,319
part of that is harm reduction because

1228
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,760
if i tell parents just let your children

1229
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,040
run feral what am i going to do what

1230
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,440
they don't

1231
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,720
i think that if you feel the need to

1232
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,400
track what your children are doing

1233
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,920
online or to track their location uh by

1234
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,920
installing something on their phone that

1235
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,839
it needs to be something that they can

1236
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,920
see and understand

1237
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,520
that they need to be aware of what

1238
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,079
you're doing of how powerful it is and

1239
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,319
the scope of how it works and you need

1240
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,599
to have a conversation about your

1241
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:17,760
expectations um you should not fool your

1242
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,520
children in the same way that you should

1243
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,200
not fool your partners and you should

1244
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,520
not fool your employees and you should

1245
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,720
not you know fool strangers there's uh

1246
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,680
you know

1247
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,160
behavior you're interested in tracking

1248
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,040
uh

1249
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,839
surveillance without consent is

1250
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,440
unethical and uh in many contexts it is

1251
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,119
also illegal

1252
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,559
okay we have one comment um

1253
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,240
basically um

1254
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,359
linuxgirl

1255
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,800
says thanks for the work you do to

1256
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,040
support uh for the eff and to support

1257
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,880
the important mission how can people get

1258
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,400
involved with the ff and how can they

1259
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,160
support the eff well financially

1260
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:56,880
so

1261
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,960

1264
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,119

1265
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,440

the internet and how you can fix it

1272
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,480
through uh through clicking on things uh

1273
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,520
and

1274
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,119
