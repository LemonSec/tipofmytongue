2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,880
all right um i just want to say again um

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,799
hello us community i want to start off

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,480
with saying a big big big

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,199
congratulations to owasp 20 years is a

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,920
huge milestone i know how much wasp has

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,160
changed my life for the better like a

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,320
big congratulations to the oas team and

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,640
the oas community so today i just want

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,400
to talk a little bit more about

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,160
how we can change threat modeling how do

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,880
we

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,239
approach it differently in these years

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,239
we all talk about security should be

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,879
everyone's responsibility and we should

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,120
definitely do that but let's redefine

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,800
what threat modeling is and let's

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
democratize it let's make sure that

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,640
everyone knows how to do it and it's

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,239
everyone's actual responsibility

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,039
so

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,280
um what's the agenda for today the goal

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
is to talk a little bit more about how

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,600
we can do self-serve threat modeling and

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,199
why i think it's the future so we'll

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,879
cover a little bit about what threat

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,199
modeling is so that we could be all on

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,519
the same page then we'll talk about a

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,799
little bit about self-serve threat

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,799
modeling and then we'll do a little deep

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,560
dive into the program that we have set

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,240
up that my current company and talk

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,159
about the good and bad things about this

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,920
sort of program

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,400
um a little bit about myself i'm a guy

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,240
that did software development in my

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,040
career um like a really really really

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,439
long time of it then

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,200
i've always been interested in security

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,040
and one day a really really smart

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
security guy told me that i should join

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,119
his team and become a security engineer

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,840
i listened to him i joined and then and

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,320
that was a long time ago and i've done

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,799
security for a long time now and these

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,720
days i try to help other people to learn

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,680
about security and get into security um

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,360
which is why i've been super involved

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,159
with oaspa in the last several years and

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,280
in particular the vancouver chapter here

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,399
and making sure that we get good

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,560
speakers that come out and

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,920
introduce new speakers to owasp as well

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,560
so one fun fact about me i'm really good

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,240
at annoying my family because i like to

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,639
talk a lot about risk having said that i

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,639
was definitely not able to predict the

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,319
yeast shortage at the beginning of the

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,640
pandemic i could not have ever

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,239
envisioned that everyone would go on a

61
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,280
bread baking binge so it was upsetting

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,800
to me because i wasn't able to make

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
pizza for like a month but fortunately

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
now that i've been able to mitigate that

65
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,879
risk by i have a good supply of yeast

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,959
and then hopefully it doesn't run out

67
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,760
okay so let's talk a little bit about

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,200
threat modeling again i don't really

69
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
want to spend too much time about it but

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,319
i want to make sure that we're on the

71
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,319
same page with respect to threat

72
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,239
modeling

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,800
um what is threat modeling the goal of

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,680
threat modeling is pretty

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,840
straightforward we want to identify the

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,000
assets that we have in our system and

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,560
figure out the risks to those assets

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,480
once we understand the risks it's really

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,640
possible for us to think about all the

80
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,720
different ways that we can protect our

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,840
assets

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,680
and at the very base of threat modeling

83
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,480
it should be simple transparent and we

84
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,720
should ensure that everyone has a voice

85
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
everyone's opinion is very different

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,959
about a particular system and how you

87
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,800
can attack it so making sure that

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,480
everyone is involved will help make sure

89
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,480
that we have we build a robust system

90
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,640
okay

91
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,879
why is threat modeling important

92
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,480
there are many many different reasons

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,720
for why it's important um security is

94
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,519
embedded right into the design phase as

95
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,519
an industry we talk a lot about shifting

96
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,280
left we talk about it because the

97
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,159
further left you shift security

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,400
potentially your system will become much

99
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
more robust and it can

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,560
withstand a lot of attacks

101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
so threat modeling is very very far left

102
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,959
because we're performing security right

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,480
in the design phase

104
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,599
this also means you can fix

105
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,200
vulnerabilities before they are actually

106
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,080
created in the system so you can

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,519
which is amazing you can fix

108
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,280
vulnerabilities before a single line of

109
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,120
code has been written

110
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
threat modeling is also a great way to

111
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,560
discover assets in your system so when

112
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,159
you're architecting a solution or when a

113
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,319
developer is architecting a solution if

114
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,640
you know your assets you will make sure

115
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,480
that you think more about the resiliency

116
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,840
of those assets

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,080
and or if you have an attacker mindset

118
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,920
as a developer you'll think about the

119
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,680
various ways you can cause harm to those

120
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,320
assets so having thought about that

121
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,160
while you're in the design phase and

122
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,000
you'll make sure that you start thinking

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,560
about ways to make it more resilient

124
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,919
that modeling is great to prioritize

125
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,240
your mediation efforts you'll discover

126
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,680
problems in your system when you threat

127
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,759
model you just need to figure out what

128
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,280
all those problems are which ones are

129
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,360
important which ones

130
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,280
that are less important so then you can

131
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,240
figure out which ones you need to

132
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,040
mitigate right away

133
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,759
it's a document of threats of my

134
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,240
mitigations and assumptions so for me

135
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,080
personally i love the paper trail of

136
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,560
threat models when i enjoyed my and when

137
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,880
i joined my current company i

138
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,400
peeked around looked at the various

139
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,520
threat models that they've done in the

140
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
past and it gave me a real good

141
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,040
understanding of how

142
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,639
this company really thought about

143
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,560
threats and how we want to address those

144
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,680
threats

145
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,840
and also making sure that we have a

146
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,120
document is

147
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,800
important because threat models do go

148
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,759
stale so if you have a document of

149
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,360
all these previous threat models you can

150
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,000
look at them occasionally and make sure

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,840
that the assumptions that we've made in

152
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,160
the past are still valid assumptions

153
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
they might not be valid assumptions any

154
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
longer something you consider as a low

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,160
risk in the past might now be a critical

156
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,039
risk now so having it documented really

157
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,960
makes it easier to go back and revisit

158
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
them

159
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,160
and i love that like

160
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,000
that models are a great tool for

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,720
security researcher especially if you're

162
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,199
engaging with them for pen testing so

163
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,560
we've started doing that with some of

164
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
our threat models and we get to share

165
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,400
these documents and

166
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,560
i love having a security researcher just

167
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,639
go in and we made a bunch of assumptions

168
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,160
have them either prove that the

169
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,600
assumptions were correct or that they

170
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,720
were wrong

171
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,840
and it makes it it makes you know that

172
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,280
you're building a proper system

173
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,280
okay now that we talked a little bit

174
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,199
about what threat modeling is just to

175
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,080
get on the same page

176
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,240
let's redefine it threat modeling is

177
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,400
ridiculously hard we should think about

178
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,880
ways to make it easier and i should note

179
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,479
this is one way to empower your

180
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,000
developers to do threat modeling but

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
there are many many different flavors of

182
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,520
doing it as well

183
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,479
so

184
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,240
um what are some of the problems that

185
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,919
we're trying to solve with uh threat

186
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,318
modeling

187
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,120
that modeling comes with a ton of its

188
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,440
own problems and there are four few

189
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,360
particular problems that we want to

190
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,199
solve when we want to redefine our

191
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,880
threat modeling program

192
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,199
it's hard to scale so in many companies

193
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,039
there are very few folks that actually

194
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,199
know how to threat model well

195
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,440
and if a company grows and it grows

196
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,120
exponentially

197
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
the issue can get worse it can get so

198
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,759
much so worse that you'll hit number two

199
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,840
whereas developers might get blocked by

200
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,880
security

201
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,800
so if you have a sdl a security

202
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,039
development life cycle where it requires

203
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,639
the development team to threat model

204
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,919
every feature

205
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,800
then if you have a larger team then it

206
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,440
makes it really difficult so if there

207
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,960
are only a few fields that can do it

208
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,280
well that means the business only has a

209
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,560
few options

210
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,720
so either security kills themselves by

211
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
doing threat modeling everything

212
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,520
themselves which is unrealistic

213
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,599
development gets blocked and waits for

214
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,880
security

215
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,199
whenever they need to do a threat model

216
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,080
or

217
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,520
security will have to pick and choose

218
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,800
which things to threaten model which

219
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
means a lot of

220
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,560
new features and systems may not get

221
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,680
tested

222
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,080
so usually devs will get blocked and

223
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,759
security has to pick and choose what the

224
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,319
threat model which isn't very ideal

225
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,560
um and ideally the application security

226
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
team should be focusing on the most

227
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,599
important tasks this might include doing

228
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,599
certain threat models but it doesn't

229
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,240
make sense for appsec to spend time

230
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,479
threat modeling a tool that has very

231
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,440
limited use and it's internal or

232
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,919
it it is very hard to find

233
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,479
so what needs to be done that in the

234
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,960
situation where you have a small team

235
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,080
so

236
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,400
apsec folks should always focus on the

237
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,319
things that are the highest impact of

238
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,440
the business

239
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,039
and we shouldn't just threat model for

240
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,159
the sake of threat modeling

241
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,919
okay

242
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,800
so what is self-serve threat modeling in

243
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,360
my utopian world developers are going to

244
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,440
do the vast majority of models without

245
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
even security being part of the process

246
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,360
that means that they're going to

247
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,120
identify the assets

248
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,599
discover the risks figure out which

249
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,599
risks prioritize those risks and figure

250
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,000
out which ones they want to remediate

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,080
and they will be able to do this end to

252
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,880
end

253
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,720
the security team should focus on

254
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
training the engineers to get better at

255
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
threat modeling security's role should

256
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
be training and making sure that they're

257
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,800
getting the engineers are getting better

258
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,200
and better and better at modeling every

259
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,360
year you hopefully can bring in new and

260
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,839
improved training that should roll out

261
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,440
make sure that everyone

262
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,279
is refreshed and knows how to threat

263
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,040
model even better

264
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,120
new new employees should get all of the

265
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,560
training and no employees should get the

266
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,480
new trainings that are coming out so

267
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,519
there's constant learning

268
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,680
the goal is actually to make a bunch of

269
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,120
mini security engineers throughout the

270
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,560
organization

271
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,880
at some point you'll have an army of

272
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,440
mini security engineers which means that

273
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,000
they'll be empowered to find bad things

274
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,720
in their systems and they'll want to fix

275
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,240
those bad things they're the ones that

276
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,600
discover it so they have an incentive to

277
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,920
actually resolve those things

278
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,200
so

279
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,000
it just makes things a lot better having

280
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,080
this sort of model

281
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,160
and security gets to scale throughout

282
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,320
the entire organization with self-serve

283
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
threat modeling it means that

284
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,040
security can fit to any size of

285
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,640
organization it doesn't matter if you

286
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,600
have 10 engineers or if you have 10 000

287
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,680
engineers when the engineering team can

288
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,279
do the threat models

289
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,839
themselves security will be able to

290
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,160
scale

291
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
so

292
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,600
does it really solve our problems well

293
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,079
self-serve threat modeling we consider

294
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,519
threat modeling is hard to scale well

295
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,440
when everyone is trained to threat model

296
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,160
by definition we just scaled our program

297
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,079
the engineering team can now go and do

298
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,120
the vast majority of models themselves

299
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,800
engineering should no longer be blocked

300
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,440
by security since now that they can do

301
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,120
the threat model themselves they don't

302
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,279
have to wait for us and they can just do

303
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,279
threat models whenever they need to

304
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,360
and finally security engineers can be

305
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,279
able to focus on the most critical of

306
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,240
tasks

307
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,640
it may mean that you focus on just the

308
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,800
critical threat models but it might be

309
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
that you might be able to focus on other

310
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,839
things as well within the

311
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,800
organization so

312
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,720
does this mean it's vacation time for us

313
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,880
uh security folks

314
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,959
well not just yet um let's really dive

315
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,560
into what self-serving threat modeling

316
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,160
actually is not

317
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,680
so self-serving modeling doesn't mean

318
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,360
that the secure team no longer is

319
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,640
involved with the threat modeling

320
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,720
process it's a program where security

321
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,959
can now focus their efforts on being

322
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,959
better according to the risks of the

323
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,399
organization

324
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,560
so if they're if we're concerned with

325
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,279
authentication or authorization or

326
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,839
pi or phi we can just focus our efforts

327
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,720
on tackling those sort of things

328
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,480
self-serve threat modeling also isn't an

329
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,240
excuse to blame the developers if they

330
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
miss something we're not going to point

331
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,680
fingers at developers if they missed a

332
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,399
risk

333
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,560
the program is a team effort it's all of

334
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,920
our responsibility to make sure that

335
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,480
we're securing our applications

336
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
this also doesn't mean that security is

337
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,760
out of a job

338
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
yeah we know that once uh

339
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
like one of our responsibilities is

340
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,760
taken care of by someone else there is

341
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,399
going to be a hundred others to replace

342
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,680
uh that one um responsibility so

343
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,920
unfortunately um

344
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,240
security is always going to be busy

345
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,519
and this doesn't substitute other

346
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,399
important things for security so

347
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,240
not like being able to threat model all

348
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,839
the things is great but we still need to

349
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,519
make sure that we continue to do other

350
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,120
things to make sure that we have a

351
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,360
strong security posture like security

352
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,040
tooling pen testing metrics all that

353
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,560
sort of stuff is really important that's

354
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,720
part of our programs

355
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,600
so

356
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,920
how is this program set up

357
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,959
well there are four different phases as

358
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,600
part of this program

359
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,839
training phase which is you actually

360
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,920
train the developers observation phase

361
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,880
is where

362
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,279
the engineers are now leading the threat

363
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,839
modeling session and the security team

364
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,560
is in the room listening in coaching and

365
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,680
advising them

366
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,200
the review phase

367
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,440
which is security team is no longer in

368
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,279
the threat modeling sessions the

369
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,959
engineers will actually do the threat

370
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,279
models themselves and security will

371
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,519
review and make sure everything has been

372
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,279
accounted for and then the security

373
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,880
optional phase is actually where

374
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,959
security is optional they can choose to

375
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,440
look or not look at it

376
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,959
so um

377
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,959
although i say there's four phases this

378
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,200
is actually in my opinion there's only

379
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,440
really two phases it's the training

380
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,839
phase so training is training

381
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,519
observation phase is really training

382
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,760
version two review page is really

383
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,839
training version three and security

384
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,440
optional phase is the security optional

385
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,279
phase so there's training and security

386
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,440
optional and i'll dive into deeper why i

387
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,760
think that it's mostly training

388
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,560
so

389
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,480
um training phase in order to do

390
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,240
self-serve threat modeling engineers

391
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
need to learn how to actually threat

392
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,800
model so we had some principles we came

393
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,399
up with when it came to the training

394
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,480
itself we want to make sure that

395
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,760
engineering is motivated to learn

396
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
so i'm not too sure if everyone's the

397
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,120
same way as me but i tend to learn when

398
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
i'm when the material is fun and

399
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,880
engaging you want the engineers to

400
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,480
actually want to learn they want them to

401
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,079
show up to these training sessions and

402
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,360
be eager to figure out what's going on

403
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,959
so you want to make you have to make

404
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,279
those sessions interactive

405
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,040
have a lot of questions for the group it

406
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,880
shouldn't be one-way communication keep

407
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,560
the group small so that people are

408
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,320
comfortable to actually speak and get

409
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,279
involved

410
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,360
it has to be really a group effort when

411
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,880
it comes to actually doing these

412
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,240
sessions

413
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,560
we also want to say that security is a

414
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,320
marathon and not a sprint

415
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,600
who says you have to do all the

416
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,720
trainings at once this is a multi-year

417
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
program and you don't have to do a

418
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,560
hundred percent of the training in one

419
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,720
sitting so make the training in the way

420
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,560
that it's easy to learn and retain the

421
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,480
information

422
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,440
teach engineers things relevant to your

423
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,199
business threat modeling training should

424
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,040
be done in the same vein as threat

425
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,880
modeling within the neuron if you do

426
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,959
risk assessments train engineers to do

427
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,880
risk assessments if you use stride to

428
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,959
find vulnerabilities train engineers to

429
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,040
do strive to find vulnerabilities

430
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,959
incorporate our threat modeling workflow

431
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,560
into the training

432
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,800
so again the goal of the training is to

433
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,880
teach people how they can retain and to

434
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,800
retain the most information

435
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,480
so with those principles in mind we

436
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,760
decided to

437
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,240
spread training over three sessions

438
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,040
because

439
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,360
i personally don't want to sit in one

440
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,160
course for a day all by myself or with a

441
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,480
small group and try

442
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,839
understanding all the things that the

443
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,000
security team is throwing at at me

444
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,920
so every time i went to any security

445
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,000
conference for training i didn't retain

446
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,920
too much information we pay a lot of

447
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,680
money for all these trainings which

448
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,360
means that the trainer will provide a

449
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
ton of information to make sure that you

450
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,480
get your money's worth

451
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,959
i have to sit through 8 or 16 hours of

452
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,079
training

453
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,639
i'll probably retain 10 of it on a good

454
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,160
day so

455
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,759
these are fortunately you're going to be

456
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,839
training employees of the company

457
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,759
and we were able to structure the

458
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,600
training in a fashion that would provide

459
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,120
the most benefits

460
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,959
um i split up the training into three

461
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,600
sessions the first one i want to

462
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,360
introduce the concept of threat modeling

463
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,040
and we use stride internally so i want

464
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,800
to introduce those concepts

465
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,480
the point is to get them familiar with

466
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,959
the concepts and we did a little bit of

467
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,199
hands-on practice so that they got to

468
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,160
use the concept that they're learning

469
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,680
the second

470
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,920
session that we set up was to introduce

471
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,680
the concept of assets and data

472
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,199
classifications which were important to

473
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,639
our organization

474
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,120
so there weren't as many new concepts

475
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,959
and we did a lot more exercises they

476
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,880
were much much deeper into

477
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,199
the examples

478
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,720
and the third one was to actually do a

479
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,880
threat modeling session with a piece of

480
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,480
the application that the

481
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
development team owned

482
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,839
that way they get to get their hands

483
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,000
super dirty and they really understand

484
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,920
how things work from end to end for

485
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,120
modeling

486
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
so training folks this way made it

487
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,639
really easy for them to retain

488
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,560
information and actually get something

489
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,160
out of these sessions again we don't

490
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,040
want to bombard them with information

491
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,880
and then throw them into

492
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,519
a fire and say do it we want to make

493
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,280
sure that we

494
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,519
[Music]

495
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,759
train them appropriately and work with

496
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,440
them

497
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,199
so some notes

498
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,560
about uh

499
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,480
just some of the learnings that we had

500
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,120
remember it takes years for us security

501
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,199
professionals to get good at training uh

502
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,519
or at threat modeling so it's gonna take

503
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,360
engineers about the same amount of time

504
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,799
to be good at it as you

505
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,679
need to train them up and make sure it's

506
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,039
an easy digestible format for them

507
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,119
and try different things and concepts

508
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,679
we started

509
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,559
teaching threat modeling with every

510
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,400
every sort of everyday things that

511
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,039
people did so we started with personal

512
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,559
safety people

513
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,359
they

514
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,679
really related to that and we moved from

515
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,760
physical safety concepts and we sort of

516
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,679
slowly tried to translate them to the

517
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,480
threat modeling examples so try a few

518
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,400
different things and see what works

519
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,160
really well and which is why i always

520
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,440
love to tell you

521
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,520
fail fast and i'm going to repeat myself

522
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,480
a lot

523
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,120
as a part of it

524
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,600
throw out your training get feedback

525
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,799
iterate on it

526
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,640
i did that a few times and with my

527
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,840
program i had beta engineering team they

528
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,120
tested it out they gave me great

529
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,200
feedback i iterated on it

530
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,120
got more feedback and within a couple of

531
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,760
iterations i got my training 95 of the

532
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
way there the sooner you can get it out

533
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,600
and get people to give you feedback it

534
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,840
makes it a lot easier

535
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,080
also i've never done trainings over zoom

536
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,400
until covet so that was an interesting

537
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,960
experience so some of the hints that

538
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,799
what i recommend is get people to leave

539
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,320
their video on if it's a small group

540
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,160
they don't mind and they know people in

541
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,640
that group and make sure to ask

542
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,120
random people questions and help keep

543
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,400
people on their toes and they'll pay

544
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,320
more attention i know that's kind of me

545
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,400
but i had a lot of fun with it and same

546
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,280
with the groups that i did

547
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,320
um so what's the observation phase like

548
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,840
i mentioned this is really training

549
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,720
version two so you move from learning

550
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,919
the theory

551
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,480
or to becoming an intern or having some

552
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
hands-on apprenticeship

553
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,000
so have the engineering team focus on

554
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
getting all of their appropriate

555
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,360
documentations

556
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,960
prepared for the threat modeling

557
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
sessions

558
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,559
we should make sure that they are they

559
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,240
take the lead of the threat modding

560
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,160
sessions themselves and this doesn't

561
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,600
take too much extra time from the

562
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,679
engineering team a particular engineer

563
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,600
may put an extra half an hour to get the

564
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,280
documentation in order

565
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,480
they get the information set up they set

566
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,160
up the meetings make sure the right

567
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,240
people are involved

568
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,360
it's not that much of an uplift

569
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,200
the goal of the stage is to make sure

570
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,720
that the engineering team is good enough

571
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,960
to do threat modeling on their own

572
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,200
and try not to tell the engineers what

573
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,280
the vulnerabilities are just give them

574
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,400
hints and coach them towards it as well

575
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,600
work with them to figure out the

576
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,039
prioritization once they figure out all

577
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,799
the vulnerabilities which ones they

578
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,039
should remediate immediately which ones

579
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,960
are we can leave them

580
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,799
for later

581
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,600
the goal is that every engineer should

582
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,840
leave those that motley sessions feeling

583
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,600
that they've learned something new

584
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,840
and once you start seeing them find all

585
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,280
of the critical and high priority

586
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,960
vulnerabilities then you know that

587
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,640
they're getting ready to move on to that

588
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,840
next stage

589
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,120
so some of the notes that we've

590
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,280
discovered during the observation phase

591
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,400
is again

592
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,159
your job is to coach and get them to a

593
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,600
place where they can do threat modeling

594
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,880
without you

595
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,120
it's in your best interest to get them

596
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
to learn

597
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,600
i help the engineering teams especially

598
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,520
at the beginning with the documentation

599
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,480
and i use that one-on-one time to

600
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,320
sell threat modeling to the engineer

601
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
talk to how great it will be when

602
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,159
security is no longer involved as part

603
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,360
of the process

604
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,880
and you got to remember threat modeling

605
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,480
is a team sport make sure you have

606
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,320
enough people in the conversation and

607
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,240
the opinions are diverse enough as well

608
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,799
you want to build out a robust system

609
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,760
um i love to direct message people that

610
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,960
are not really talking enough in the

611
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,480
threat modeling sessions

612
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,559
everyone's voice counts teach people to

613
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,120
call out other people for being quiet

614
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,440
i've learned a lot of times when i call

615
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,760
folks out they come up with amazing

616
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,360
threats that i didn't even consider

617
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,039
myself so it's super important to do

618
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:51,919
that

619
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,679
and the more the conversations that we

620
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,440
have during the sessions the better the

621
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,320
actual threat model um threats that we

622
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,840
actually discover

623
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
i love closing the loop with engineers

624
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,760
afterwards let them know that they did a

625
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,120
bang-up job

626
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,640
and give them a hearty congratulations

627
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,159
and one thing to note is that some

628
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,320
people are just super natural at threat

629
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,480
modeling so literally the first time

630
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,039
that we did this me and a co-workers

631
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,799
were fairly senior

632
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,039
we had two engineers that

633
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,880
that were part of it so they prepared

634
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,960
the documentation we got into a room we

635
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,280
talked about the vulnerabilities and try

636
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,440
to figure out how

637
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,760
which ones that we want to deal with

638
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,080
me and my co-worker literally did not

639
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,320
provide any additional information as

640
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,760
part of that session

641
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,400
the engineers they discovered all of the

642
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,240
vulnerabilities that we had in mind i

643
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,320
was super proud of them like it was a

644
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,480
but it was a huge hit on my ego like i

645
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,600
thought it would be relevant for a

646
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
little longer but these engineers they

647
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,120
made me feel that i was replaceable

648
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
which is ultimately a good thing like it

649
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,799
means that i could go focus on other

650
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,559
things

651
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,799
okay the review phase is where

652
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,200
we're hoping we're at at our current

653
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,600
company uh security is not actively

654
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,480
involved in some of the threat models

655
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,000
but there are some teams that are good

656
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,360
enough that they're threat modeling on

657
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,000
their own and what we do as security

658
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,840
folks we actually just review the

659
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,760
artifacts so

660
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,360
again the engineers they put together

661
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,360
the documentation they do the threat

662
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,640
model they'll prioritize the

663
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,240
vulnerabilities and they'll figure out

664
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,559
which uh which threats that they should

665
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,720
remediate immediately and ones which

666
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,880
they can leave for later

667
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,640
we will review the artifacts just to

668
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,240
make sure that they've

669
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,679
discovered all the critical and high

670
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,600
vulnerabilities

671
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,320
and

672
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,159
in reality we've been running into these

673
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,799
situations quite a few times just at my

674
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,799
current company like there have been a

675
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,320
few situations where the engineer didn't

676
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,159
realize that they were not supposed to

677
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,840
go ahead and do an entire threat model

678
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,600
on their own while they did it and they

679
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,360
put they did one they put together the

680
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,919
threat modeling documentation so it

681
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,679
would still schedule the threat modeling

682
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,400
session um and we'll get into the

683
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,919
meetings to discover that they've done

684
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,080
all the work and they came up with a ton

685
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,159
of great threats to the system and did a

686
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,919
fantastic job

687
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,919
i think in most of those situations

688
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,720
they've covered about 90 of the issues

689
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,559
and that a lot of the times they've

690
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,240
discovered things that i didn't even

691
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,919
consider so they know their systems

692
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,679
really well and they're better at threat

693
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,640
modeling their systems than i am

694
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,520
so

695
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,400
um the security optional phase

696
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,679
this is

697
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,720
where security utopia is and this is

698
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,440
what we all dream about uh security is

699
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,760
truly optional in space pretty much all

700
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,440
the features being developed should be

701
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,559
threat model security should continue to

702
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,880
be involved in certain situations i want

703
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,000
to be involved when there's

704
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,159
authentication authorization type of

705
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,840
threat models or pai phi is processed or

706
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,279
anything that touches the internet so

707
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,440
it's really really critical on um areas

708
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,120
and for you you'll discover the things

709
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
that are important to you and you want

710
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,360
as part of it and i do hope over time we

711
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
start seeing if we're in this

712
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,960
security optional phase

713
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
a measurable change in our pug bounty

714
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,559
program and

715
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,559
like there'll be fewer fewer critical

716
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,640
and high vulnerabilities that we release

717
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,120
and we have to pay a lot more for those

718
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,360
uh in the our bug money program to

719
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,640
attract the great security researchers

720
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
and now you can kick up your feet for

721
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,360
reals because it's a security optional

722
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,159
okay

723
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,480
so we talked about um the program in

724
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
itself now i want to sort of talk about

725
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,679
some of the good things and bad things

726
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,440
that we learned about this program at my

727
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,880
current company

728
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,039
so i'm a year into this experiment what

729
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,320
have i learned

730
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,919
um we've already talked about some of

731
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,360
the things so

732
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,760
we are threat modeling a lot more um and

733
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,000
that we did in the past the concept of

734
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,760
threat modeling is within reach of all

735
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,200
developers at my current company they

736
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,120
better understand what needs to be done

737
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,640
and what their role is within threat

738
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
modeling reducing that knowledge gap has

739
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
played a real big part in increasing the

740
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,559
frequency of threat modeling

741
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,720
engineers and threat modeling

742
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,480
like we've discovered they're so much

743
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,240
better than us they know their system

744
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,320
really well so we come into the threat

745
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,919
model we

746
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,440
have to learn their system and

747
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,520
understand and try finding uh all these

748
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
threats while they already know their

749
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,559
systems and they know the good and bad

750
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,480
parts of it now that we've taught them

751
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,400
how to find vulnerabilities they're

752
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,840
usually able to use that knowledge and

753
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,320
create a much more robust system

754
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,080
trained engineers are better at finding

755
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,000
vulnerabilities in their system compared

756
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,240
to a trained security engineer

757
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,559
so please note that um engineers they

758
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,520
don't have to be perfect at that

759
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
modeling they don't they don't need to

760
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,120
find all of the things they just need to

761
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,720
find all the critical and high

762
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,440
vulnerabilities as part of the system

763
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,919
our security culture has improved leaps

764
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,360
and bounds

765
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,720
i don't know if it's because that

766
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,400
they're more interested in security or

767
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,480
that they understand security more

768
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,640
or they are exposed to what security is

769
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,799
really like it is simply much more

770
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,880
interesting to them so they're reaching

771
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,880
out and asking me questions all of the

772
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,039
time i also

773
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,360
noted that failing fast is a win when i

774
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,799
started this project on self-serve

775
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,480
threat modeling and it's i had some

776
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,440
analysis paralysis but as soon as i put

777
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,520
out the training and iterated on it

778
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,279
it just removed the paralysis so make

779
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,360
sure that you get your feedback quickly

780
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,559
from your

781
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,320
teams

782
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,120
okay

783
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,520
what are some of the challenges

784
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,559
um

785
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,760
yeah i don't think i mentioned that

786
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,679
front modeling isn't self-serve threat

787
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,279
modeling isn't just rainbows and

788
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,120
chocolate chip cookies there's a lot of

789
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,279
challenges to running this program so

790
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,559
let's talk about the elephant in the

791
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,919
room this is a multi-year program in our

792
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,000
industry it's a rarity that folks stay

793
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,360
on for more than a couple of years so

794
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,039
you need to make sure that whomever is

795
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,559
running the program is there for a

796
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,640
multi-year many folks can run this

797
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,600
program

798
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,520
this is a very large and key investment

799
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,279
from the secure team they need to make

800
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,400
sure that there are some sort of

801
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,240
continuity with this program that will

802
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,000
last even if someone were to leave the

803
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,200
organization

804
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120
so the

805
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,039
investment makes complete sense but you

806
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,720
have to keep that in mind it's a very

807
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,400
very large program

808
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,320
training is hard for a bunch of reasons

809
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,480
have you ever delivered someone else's

810
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,360
presentation so i have in my past and

811
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,039
it's difficult so

812
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,480
what i always recommend is make sure

813
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,640
that you train your trainers and give

814
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,480
them the autonomy that they need to

815
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,559
modify the training to make it their own

816
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,480
so it have that sense of ownership and

817
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,279
it's easier for them to deliver it

818
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,279
um and my current company it's easy for

819
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,200
us to really scale the program we only

820
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,240
have 150 200 engineers but how do you

821
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,919
scale this program to a company that has

822
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,840
several thousand developers

823
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,600
i personally was able to train about 80

824
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,679
of the engineers at my company but

825
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,640
scaling this program to a lot larger

826
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,080
organization it won't be a trivial task

827
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,200
so

828
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,640
it would be very difficult to do it

829
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,279
instructor-led training but

830
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,720
without that hand-holding you might not

831
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,960
get the results that you want

832
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,919
so

833
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,840
where can you get some additional

834
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,120
information

835
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,320
um

836
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,880
i have a few links up here feel free to

837
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,559
look at this this blog has some

838
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,480
additional details that i didn't get to

839
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,080
into this presentation it's always good

840
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,120
resource the whole point of us sharing

841
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,200
