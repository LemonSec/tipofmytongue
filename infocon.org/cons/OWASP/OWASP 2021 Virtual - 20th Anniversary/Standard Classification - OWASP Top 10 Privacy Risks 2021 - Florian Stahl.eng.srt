[Music]

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,080
oh yeah also welcome from my side so as

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,000
taka already said my name is florian

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,400
stahl i'm right here in germany

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,000
and i will tell you a little bit about

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,560
the updated version of the over top 10

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,519
privacy risks today i don't want to tell

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,000
you too much about myself

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,320
i have i would say a rather classical

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,800
career in information security privacy

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,960
i'm rather chemical from the technical

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,880
area i did penetration tests a while

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,440
back and now i moved more and more to

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,160
the

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,040
security management

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,000
area

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,440
back in 2014 i founded this over top 10

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440
privacy project together with a

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,280
colleague and

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,520
yeah i still eat it today and we thought

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,079
it's time to to update it because it's

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,280
been a while

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,000
and that's what i'm gonna tell you today

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,120
about

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,239
so well what is a prior the privacy

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,520
situation

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,920
in the world at the moment so i have a

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,720
few a few words put on this slide and of

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,200
course privacy is about personal data so

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,000
data that is about you about me

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,640
about individuals

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
in the english speaking area we rather

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,880
talk about personal identifiable

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,200
information which is not the same but

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,479
similar

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,439
and then we are uh facing several

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,280
challenges at the moment i mean there is

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,320
regulation out there like see gdpr like

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,280
ccpa and in other countries there are

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,960
similar regulations

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,200
um but this regulation maybe is not

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,400
perfect yet

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,600
you've seen

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,840
you maybe i might know mark schrems the

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,720
privacy activists from austria that

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,520
and the european court just decided that

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,920
the gdp apr or the transfer mechanisms

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,240
to third countries are not really

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,520
appropriate

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
also one reason for that is because

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
there are still secret services that

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,119
violate fundamental rights

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,520
by doing surveillance because they want

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,160
to avoid further terror attacks even

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,038
though it's maybe not sure if they

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,720
if they're succeeding with this so

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,000
surveillance

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,239
and then of course we have a global

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,720
world so even though we have already

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,360
regulation that is maybe valid in more

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,200
than one country we still have different

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,040
regulations all over the world but we

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,520
have one global internet and of course

64
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,200
then we also need somehow global

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,879
standards and that's also what we're

66
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,680
trying to establish with this over top

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,640
10 privacy risk project then there are

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,959
internet technologies and uh i think

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,640
most of you know that

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,560
surveillance is the business model of

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,040
the internet and your data if you're on

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,840
google on facebook and so on is

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,640
is uh yeah the things that they sell to

74
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,400
advertising

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,200
and

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
that this is kind how these companies

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,440
uh earn their money and at the same time

78
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,239
they're um what i experience in many

79
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,480
different companies there's still a lack

80
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,400
of implementation of privacy in practice

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,879
not only because people do not want

82
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,879
privacy or do not want to implement also

83
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,920
because

84
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,080
they're still two less or too little

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
people that know how to do it because i

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,720
think it's not so difficult

87
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,080
but many

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,720
do not know how to implement it

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,760
yeah

90
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,440
but it's not only about the companies

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,080
maybe also the authorities

92
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,200
should

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,239
yeah improve uh still the enforcement of

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,480
the regulation that is out there i mean

95
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,159
we have still many

96
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,440
open court cases we have situations like

97
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,840
maybe at the moment that is not directly

98
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,680
related to web application but there are

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
self-driving cars that

100
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,879
record

101
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,480
their surroundings with the camera this

102
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,519
is also a really um an issue for privacy

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,360
and there are always new technologies

104
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
that have also to be considered

105
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,640
by the regulators and in the end we also

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,720
have of course strong lobbyism because

107
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,680
um

108
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,920
yeah these business models if privacy

109
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,799
will be enforced really hard let's say

110
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,560
um is of course uh threatened by a huge

111
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,040
global companies social networks search

112
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,199
engine providers and they invest a lot

113
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,478
of money to

114
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,320
to avoid that

115
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,720
regulation and also enforcement gets too

116
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,479
strong

117
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,040
so this is the situation and

118
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,520
now let's come to the over top 10

119
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
privacy risk projects some some facts

120
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,160
and figures um so as i mentioned we

121
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,840
started back in 2014 we founded this

122
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,120
project and we published version 1.0

123
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,520
also together with the university of

124
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,759
applied sciences in munich

125
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,600
and um

126
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,919
this was an early kind of earlier time

127
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,400
in privacy than now now privacy has

128
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,040
matured and then we also got contacted

129
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,720
by the european data protection

130
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,639
supervisor that founded the internet

131
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,199
privacy engineering network we became

132
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,759
part of that and that helped us to also

133
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,400
distribute this message and of course

134
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,600
it's uh not only about privacy risks

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,919
because if you know your risks

136
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,360
it's good but you still have to do

137
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,199
something against your risks and that's

138
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,479
uh what we

139
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,080
what we're trying to help with the

140
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,199
countermeasures that we published in

141
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,000
2016

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,479
and then in the beginning of this year

143
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,759
we published version 2.0

144
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,520
and i will tell you more about that

145
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,440
later currently we're working on the

146
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,320
counter measures of version 2.0

147
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,720
and the project is available in five

148
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,520
languages soon it will be available in

149
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,320
seven

150
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,039
languages and we have the os lab project

151
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,639
status and of course you find a lot of

152
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,960
more information uh on the project

153
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,039
website as well

154
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,000
so what is the goal of the project

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,560
we want to identify the 10 most

156
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,720
important technical and organizational

157
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,479
privacy risks for web applications so

158
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,479
it's not about only about technology

159
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,080
because technology can help to establish

160
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
privacy but in the beginning you also

161
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,240
might have to do some design some

162
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,680
business decisions and so there is

163
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
there are yeah technical topics that

164
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,280
helps to improve privacy but also

165
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,080
organizational topic and the top 10 pro

166
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,360
project shows both of them

167
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,520
and it was important for us also to

168
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,240
provide transparency about privacy risks

169
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,400
independent from local laws independent

170
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,720
from that what maybe huge companies

171
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
think because i think there are

172
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,120
many privacy risks that are not really

173
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,680
considered a lot in in practice

174
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,880
yet and uh we also wanted to keep it

175
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,560
yeah as i mentioned before there's a

176
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,240
global world there's a global internet

177
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,880
we do not want only consider one certain

178
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,919
law we want to consider it as a best

179
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,080
practice for privacy

180
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,560
in web applications let's say worldwide

181
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,840
and if you see these ocd principles here

182
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,120
those principles are also a part of many

183
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,840
regulations and laws so this is nothing

184
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,440
really new for those of you who have

185
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,039
already

186
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,120
dealt with privacy before

187
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,199
yeah and of course then we also want to

188
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,680
show counter measures we want to educate

189
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,840
developers business architects but we

190
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,000
also want to help legal those people who

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,160
are often responsible for privacy of

192
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,560
data protection in companies that maybe

193
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,599
do not have so much of an idea how to

194
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,759
implement privacy in practice we want to

195
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,880
help them

196
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,199
give some guidance easily understandable

197
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,400
guidance

198
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,280
how they can improve privacy in practice

199
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
in web applications for real and not

200
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,120
only on paper let's say

201
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,520
what is what is not in scope in the

202
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,000
project is a self-protection for users

203
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,919
because we think it's not in the

204
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,400
responsibility of the user to install

205
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,879
some tools on their browser on their pc

206
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,199
to protect their privacy better because

207
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,759
this is this is something that maybe we

208
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,160
as security or privacy experts can do

209
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
but for the normal user this is very

210
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,960
hard and in the end to be honest it's

211
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,599
kind of nearly impossible to really

212
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,120
protect privacy

213
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
might improve privacy by installing

214
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,280
these tools but it's very hard really to

215
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,800
protect everything and that's why we

216
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,639
think it's in the responsibilities of

217
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,680
the application providers to protect

218
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
our privacy

219
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,360
yeah

220
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,680
few words about the method that we use

221
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,400
so of course there was some kind of

222
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,080
scientific

223
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,280
model behind it we took the oecd privacy

224
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,080
principles as a baseline and then we

225
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,519
identified

226
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,719
20 different potential violations in

227
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,640
security world you would probably call

228
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,000
them threats

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,560
but in privacy it's it's rather already

230
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,000
violations

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,120
and

232
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,080
these violations were then rated with a

233
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,560
let's say classical risk rating by

234
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,200
combining the impact with the frequency

235
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,839
of occurrence and then we got this rated

236
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,959
list of

237
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,440
privacy risks and we took the top 10 as

238
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,519
they always top 10 privacy risks of

239
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,080
course there are more than 10 risks and

240
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
on the website there is also the list

241
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,440
provided with the risk number 11 to 20

242
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,839
but i think it's already uh most

243
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,640
companies i mean they already take one

244
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,959
or two step forward if they take the top

245
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:19,920
10

246
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,360
risks seriously and i think it's also a

247
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,240
yeah

248
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,560
maybe

249
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
very important for the success of these

250
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,640
over top 10 projects not only the

251
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
privacy risk project but also the

252
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,000
classical top 10 that it's kind of

253
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,240
simple and it's not too much because if

254
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,160
it's too much then it might overwhelm

255
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,880
the

256
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,040
developers or whoever has to implement

257
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,920
it

258
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,880
and then in the end of course we also

259
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
evolve countermeasures and best

260
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,640
practices

261
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,519
so to um evaluate the frequency of

262
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,839
occurrence um of course the idea at

263
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,080
first was to take some statistical data

264
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,399
but we recognized that it's still very

265
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,120
hard to get real statistical data about

266
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,200
privacy violations because companies are

267
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,680
not very keen on publishing them

268
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,399
and even though even authorities do not

269
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,200
have too much data about the the root

270
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,360
cause or the reasons why um

271
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,279
data protection or privacy incidents

272
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,000
have happened so we decided like back in

273
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,959
2014 to make a survey among experts and

274
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,680
we in the end 60 experts participated

275
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,320
and rated how often these violations

276
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,480
occur in websites

277
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
the impact rating

278
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,000
was done by an expert judgment and

279
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,079
we took the application operator

280
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,480
perspective with 30 percent of the

281
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,040
impact uh with impact on reputation and

282
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,440
brand value and also financial loss and

283
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,560
60 percent the data subject perspective

284
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,200
with uh impact on social standing

285
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,519
reputation financial financial

286
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,839
well-being and also personal freedom

287
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,600
so now let's have a look at the

288
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,880
at the results um of this

289
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,279
of the updated list and you can also see

290
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,959
how things change since 2014

291
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,079
and you can see um the first

292
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,399
three risks did not change

293
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,560
the web application vulnerabilities

294
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,200
operator cited data leakage insufficient

295
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,839
data breach response uh but the force

296
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,160
risk is very new and i will say a few

297
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,320
words about this later on it's constant

298
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,560
and everything then we also have

299
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
non-transparent policies terms and

300
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,760
condition

301
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,079
uh still but a little bit lower rated

302
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,240
the insufficient deletion of personal

303
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
data i think this is now also part of

304
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,320
many regulation my maybe this is why the

305
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,440
risks

306
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
decreased

307
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,519
and another new risk is insufficient

308
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,120
data quality

309
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
and then we have mission missing or

310
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,440
insufficient session expiration uh

311
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,839
inability of users to access and modify

312
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,639
data and the collection of data that is

313
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,560
not required for the user consenting

314
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,680
purpose

315
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,079
he also added here what you can see in

316
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,720
the in the right column

317
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,800
if it's an organizational or a technical

318
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
risk because this was sometimes

319
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,800
criticized about the the first version

320
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,279
that we did not have uh give a hint if

321
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,959
this is has to be directed to the

322
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,720
developers or it's rather

323
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,959
architectural or business topic

324
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,360
so um we

325
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,560
added

326
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,480
this if it's a technical or organization

327
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,279
so now i will say a few words about uh

328
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,600
some of those risks um but we don't have

329
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,160
to time to go through uh all of them in

330
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,560
detail but as i mentioned there's

331
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,320
more information on the website and you

332
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,880
can also find this presentation with

333
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,000
some more details on the project website

334
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,760
so um yeah

335
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,279
just because it's the number one and

336
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,040
it's still the number one i want to say

337
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,839
a few words about web application

338
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,440
vulnerabilities which is basically

339
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,160
what the classical over top 10 project

340
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,880
addresses and it's um yeah it's still

341
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,279
also a very high risk to privacy because

342
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,800
if you have vulnerabilities and if

343
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,560
there's personal data processed in your

344
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,959
web application of course this is a risk

345
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,720
that it can get hacked

346
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,600
and you probably know what to do against

347
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,079
it you can perform penetration tests you

348
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,079
have to train your developers you have

349
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,839
to

350
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,240
apply secure coding guidelines like from

351
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,040
overs or some others and of course

352
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,720
patching is also

353
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,639
still very important if your software is

354
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,079
out of date

355
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,079
yeah there might be vulnerabilities and

356
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,760
personal data could be easily accessible

357
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,680
from those who shouldn't get access to

358
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,760
it

359
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,959
well um a very interesting new topic and

360
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,600
one that i personally also think

361
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
is very important and that i like that

362
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,320
it's quite high on this new list is the

363
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
topic of content on everything

364
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,839
and uh it's you probably i mean

365
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,480
watch replication social network search

366
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,199
engine you uh you use usually click one

367
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,920
time on consent and then you accept that

368
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,320
your data is used for profiling for

369
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,120
everything it's transferred to 100 other

370
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,519
sub companies or other companies

371
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,399
and as a normal user you cannot really

372
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,040
estimate if this is appropriate or not

373
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,279
or if you really want to be transferred

374
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,800
to all of these companies maybe you

375
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
would rather prefer that it's only used

376
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,560
for a certain purpose for the use of

377
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,480
social network for

378
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,880
communicating with your with your

379
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,120
friends but you don't want that it's

380
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,880
used for advertising purpose but you

381
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
can't really you don't really have a

382
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,399
choice and this is

383
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,880
something um i mean the current

384
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,639
regulation is

385
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,040
often based on content a lot on content

386
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,160
but um there is also a very good uh

387
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,920
talked on on the post content um

388
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,800
um privacy from helen nissenbaum she's

389
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,920
uh not on technologies but she's rather

390
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,240
uh somebody about yeah who

391
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,880
who um

392
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,320
yeah talks about

393
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,800
social things and so on and she says

394
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,720
content doesn't work and we need some

395
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,560
some other regulation like we have it

396
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,720
maybe in for phone companies and phone

397
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,360
companies are not allowed to listen to

398
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,839
what people talk on the phone and she

399
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,480
says um social networks search engine

400
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,720
providers should not either be able to

401
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,279
uh listen to the send at least not to

402
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,120
the sensitive data that we are looking

403
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,800
there and that we are providing there

404
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,240
and there should be some more rules and

405
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,800
and the content should also be uh

406
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,199
voluntarily and you should or the

407
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,000
regulator states should

408
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,399
restrict data flows and because

409
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,920
otherwise these companies get too

410
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
powerful and they have too much

411
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,399
influence on our minds on the politics

412
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,680
on everything

413
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,079
and uh yeah i think this is

414
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,399
makes sense um i think we are also still

415
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,959
far away from having that really but

416
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,120
yeah if you like it think about it share

417
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,240
it

418
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,240
maybe discuss about this concept i think

419
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,920
it would be very helpful to improve

420
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,680
privacy

421
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,639
yeah one more new topic is insufficient

422
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,360
data quality might not be a privacy

423
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,320
topic at first you might rather think uh

424
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,959
confidentiality is important for privacy

425
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,560
but of course if your data is not

426
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,480
correct think about your credit rating

427
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,600
might not be uh correct the your package

428
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,440
might not be delivered to the correct

429
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,079
address and so on so data quality is

430
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,000
also very important when it comes to

431
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,079
privacy so it's important that your data

432
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,079
is up to date and correct

433
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,759
that there are possibilities that you

434
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,320
can update your personal data on in this

435
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,920
web application

436
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,880
um but also that the provider or the web

437
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,199
application uh trend that if they

438
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,120
transferred your personality to third

439
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,920
parties and if you update your data

440
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,320
of course you also have to uh provide

441
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,279
this updated data to those third parties

442
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,680
yeah and then uh the eighth risk still

443
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,079
one of my favorite risk is the missing

444
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,079
or insufficient session expiration

445
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,920
because this is something this is hardly

446
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,439
discussed this is not part of any

447
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,919
regulation or laws but still

448
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,919
i mean one of the first lessons you

449
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,160
learn as a security expert for web

450
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
applications you need an appropriate

451
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,480
session timeout i think we all know that

452
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,199
um banking sites of course have it but

453
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,760
if you have a look at social networks um

454
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,599
search engine providers and so on they

455
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,319
don't have it um one they have a well

456
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,039
hidden uh log out button it's probably

457
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,520
in the second level of the menu and

458
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,200
usually you don't log out and what you

459
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,799
see here on the right side are all the

460
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,880
open sessions that i had was facebook

461
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,360
because i logged in from some location

462
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,919
close to my hometown at some point

463
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,559
and of course you can manually and kind

464
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,559
of complicated log out from these

465
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,320
sessions but it doesn't happen

466
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,160
automatically and that means at the same

467
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,080
time that these providers are able to

468
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,120
collect data from this device about you

469
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,400
all the time

470
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,000
and of course they do it on purpose

471
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
because they want to have as much data

472
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
about you as possible and

473
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,360
i think it would be helpful to have an

474
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
automatic session timeout for these

475
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,080
applications as well or maybe at least

476
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,799
that you can configure it and

477
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,280
yeah and activate it if you want to

478
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,400
yeah

479
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,520
so um well so much about

480
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,799
the most important risks um

481
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,559
that i wanted to present you and as i

482
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,679
mentioned

483
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,679
there is some more details about the

484
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,080
other risks on the website provided as

485
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,200
well i just want to uh spend a few

486
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,360
minutes to talk about the challenges

487
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,919
that we had in creating this version 2.0

488
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,720
because most of you usually only see the

489
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,760
results but of course it's not as easy

490
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,679
as some of you might think to get to

491
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,000
these results at first i think most of

492
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,760
us are kind of busy we have a job and

493
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,000
usually in security and privacy there's

494
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
a lot to do

495
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,160
and so and all wasp is a yeah a

496
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,720
foundation of volunteers of course

497
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,039
and uh it's you don't always have so

498
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,440
much time for this volunteer work as you

499
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,600
would like to so we already started with

500
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,240
work uh on version 2.0 in the beginning

501
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,120
of 2020 actually we wanted to be done

502
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,799
half a year later but

503
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,200
it turned out that yeah it took more

504
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,679
than one year until we had this version

505
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,280
2.0

506
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,559
and

507
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,039
of course it's also i mean i really like

508
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,039
this event this 20 year anniversary

509
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,400
event and i yeah it's it's global event

510
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,559
and uh it somehow connects the security

511
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,880
people and this this was also done in

512
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
this project we had people from the us

513
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,559
we had people from india we had people

514
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,039
from all over the world that

515
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,160
worked on this uh on this project um

516
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,799
core team about five or six people

517
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,720
and but of course it's also challenging

518
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,600
uh

519
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,039
already when you want to have a phone

520
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,200
call or a conference call you need to

521
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
find a time where everyone is awake

522
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,240
let's say

523
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
uh that's also why we worked a lot in

524
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,480
google docs so we commented in google

525
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,880
talks and we uh yeah

526
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,000
tried to

527
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,080
improve solutions we discussed also in

528
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,240
google docs so that we had some let's

529
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,720
say time independent uh working uh mode

530
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,120
and uh of course in the end we have very

531
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,880
different people working on the project

532
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
which is also uh

533
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,280
yeah let's say uh an advantage because

534
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,960
everybody has a different mindset and

535
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,640
brings in new ideas but in the end you

536
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,440
also have to focus on the big picture

537
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,200
at some point you have to bring these

538
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,520
discussions to an end and find a

539
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,320
yeah

540
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,760
a consensus

541
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,960
and so that everyone agrees and

542
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,360
so that you can publish in the end this

543
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,919
final version 2.0

544
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,840
i also had the feeling that it was

545
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,480
harder to find volunteers than in 2014

546
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,960
maybe it's because privacy experts are

547
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,440
busier at the moment

548
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,600
and what something that was also

549
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
challenging you might have recognized

550
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,960
that um

551
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,159
some of the

552
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,039
risks maybe are a little bit similar and

553
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,799
of course there are overlaps between the

554
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,200
topics and it's also not easy to

555
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,440
decide okay which topics can you merge

556
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
and which topics can you separate and

557
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
also which abstraction level you take

558
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,600
because if you get

559
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,520
take very detailed risks you probably

560
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,600
would have a risk list or a violation

561
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,919
list in the beginning of 50 but this was

562
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,679
just be too much and

563
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,919
nobody will probably participate in a

564
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,840
survey if it takes two or three hours

565
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,240
because you have to assess so many

566
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,400
different topics and it would just not

567
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,200
be

568
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,960
possible to handle this anymore so this

569
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
was also

570
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,600
not that easy

571
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,559
yeah

572
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,120
well what are the next steps i already

573
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,799
mentioned we still are working on some

574
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,400
translations we are working on the

575
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,559
counter measures for version 2.0 of

576
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,559
course everybody is welcome to join the

577
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,440
project um we have a mailing list on the

578
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,400
project website and maybe even more

579
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,440
important spreading the word uh bring it

580
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,280
to your friends to your colleagues to

581
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,679
your companies and apply it in practice

582
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,919
because privacy only improves if we

583
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,480
really implement these things and we do

584
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
something against the risks i know that

585
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,640
it's not always easy

586
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,480
but still i think

587
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,960
yeah it's a little bit what we can

588
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,280
do to make the world a little bit more

589
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,840
safe secure privacy friendly

590
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,559
and yeah that's uh

591
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,720
what i what i'm also working on and

592
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,480
so um

593
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,840
yeah thank you very much um for your uh

594
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,360
also for your patience in the beginning

595
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,799
because we had some technical issues

596
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,400
thank you very much for your attention

597
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,200
and

598
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
as uh um

599
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,120
takaharu mentioned in the beginning i

600
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,440
will be available on slack for at least

601
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,320
