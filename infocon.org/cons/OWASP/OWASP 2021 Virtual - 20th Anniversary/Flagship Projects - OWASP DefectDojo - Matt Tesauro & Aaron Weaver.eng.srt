2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,200
but awesome we're here to talk to you

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,280
about uh defect dojo today myself and

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,120
aaron we both been around this project

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,480
for a long time this started eight

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,279
maybe nine years ago

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,680
um as a project inside of rackspace

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,240
that that was open sourced and then um

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,920
added to the stable of obasa's projects

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,439
so who am i um i'm matt tisaro i'm a a

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,840
reformed so to speak

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,160
programmer and apsec engineer i've been

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,719
around owasp for over 13 years i'm a

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,800
leader of the apsec pipeline

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,239
project i'm one of the maintainers for

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,200
defect dojo i also did the wte project

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,039
been on the board been around

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,879
for a long long time i'm also very big

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,480
and free in libra and open source

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,879
software as well as linux i am a golang

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,480
fanboy that's what i like to code in

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,600
these days

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,199
and that is a picture of me actually

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,000
doing my double kick board break for my

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
second degree black belt

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,000
so i can actually get my none or my

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
rather substantial mass off the ground

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,880
every once in a while

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,680
awesome so i'm nowhere near as cool as

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,560
matt um only slightly

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,960
uh also i started out as a programmer as

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,040
well uh i don't know if i'm reformed yet

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,400
i'm still working on it matt's still

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,280
trying hard uh i'm doing a lot of cloud

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,520
security stuff right now as well um

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,320
similar oas chapter leader defect dojo

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
project leader

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,400
uh unlike matt i like python still it's

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,799
one of our minor disagreements um and

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,560
i'm not cool like matt i can't chop

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,320
anything the only thing that i can do is

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,320
i hang around sleeping pigs and let me

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,159
tell you if you've tried ever tried to

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,880
get a selfie with a pig it's hard my

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,960
shorts they're nibbling on it so that's

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,720
my only claim to fame is i'm a pig

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
wrangler

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,759
that probably helps you with your

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,320
security work to be honest i think so

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,640
yeah

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,360
so

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,200
i i i have to keep the slide in there i

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,520
love this picture it people love the

54
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,040
money shot right the cool hey i'm

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,479
breaking two boards it's really awesome

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,240
but behind that board breaking was a lot

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
of like grunty work to get things done

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,080
and quite honestly this is a perfect

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,760
example of how i feel

60
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,080
when i log into the 70-second different

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,000
stupid web console

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,599
to look at the output of some kind of

63
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,480
security tool i'm not a fan of that

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,560
right or when god help me i have to take

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
everybody's snow flaky

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,840
version of output and try to make sense

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,080
of it and combine it and find out that

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,400
this das tools this is actually that

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,519
that das tool something else like i'm

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,239
just sick of it

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,640
and so we did a little bit of a study a

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,920
very very very scientific study where we

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,879
asked

74
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,560
enterprise vulnerability management

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,560
programs what is your tool of choice

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,400
and i hate to say it and this is a bit

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
tongue-in-cheek but it's excel i can't

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
believe how many people manage

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
vulnerabilities in excel

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,959
i'm i'm a command line linux person i

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,440
don't much like excel period but that is

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,120
what not the right way to be handling

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,720
your vulnerabilities

84
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,640
yeah actually man this reminds me of

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,560
remember when we both worked at a large

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
education company

87
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,800
and when we came there they had them in

88
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,120
google sheets so it was a step up yeah

89
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
and then they had all these actions but

90
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,879
even visiting those sheets remember how

91
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,560
long it would take like ages for them to

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,319
even load up absolutely

93
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,799
there were so many vulnerabilities in it

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,799
it was cool what they did in there but

95
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,360
uh yeah totally misusing the the

96
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,519
technology so you can only push those

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,280
tools so far before they start to get

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,959
broken or like you said take three

99
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,799
minutes to load right which is not so

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,080
cool right so to me using spreadsheet or

101
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
even a collaborative spreadsheet like

102
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,040
product

103
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,799
is like putting rubber rain boots on

104
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,680
your dog right why

105
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,400
because it's cute yeah he's cute he's a

106
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,840
cute little guy he's a lot fatter and

107
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,599
older now unfortunately

108
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,200
um kind of like me

109
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,720
um os defect dojo is an open source uh

110
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,400
security orchestration and vulnerability

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,319
management platform

112
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,400
came out of rackspace it was created by

113
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,239
the product security team there it was

114
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,799
made by product and appsec people for

115
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,480
appsec people i think that's one of the

116
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,799
bigger differentiators it's very focused

117
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,440
on you just getting your job done

118
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,600
um and it can be the source of truth for

119
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,839
all of your security activities right

120
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,000
we're ingesting a hundred plus tools now

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,960
that's across das asked i asked

122
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,280
container tools cloud tools you name it

123
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,479
it's there

124
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,040
um and it but the it's really

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,479
fundamental or one of the great things

126
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,759
it does for you is consolidate and

127
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,360
dedupe all those findings right you have

128
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
multiple tools and you can't help but

129
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,280
kind of have to run multiple tools if

130
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,199
you have any kind of complex

131
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,199
environment that you're trying to secure

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,720
so how do you put all those together and

133
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,000
wrangle them well that's what defect

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
dojo will get you right you can create

135
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
finance you can reconcile status of

136
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,840
those findings by integrating with

137
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,400
things like jira it has a rest api so

138
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,639
it's automation friendly

139
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,320
and you can use that to maintain a list

140
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,919
of product and application information

141
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,759
right like what technologies run what

142
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,960
products

143
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,400
you can search for that now you have

144
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,960
this sort of asset inventory of all your

145
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,239
products and applications

146
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,840
and i think one of the things that

147
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,919
defect dojo has done really in a very

148
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,919
good way is that

149
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,840
there's nothing that we don't eat

150
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,000
i mean we pretty much consume it all i

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,479
mean going back to my pig analogy we're

152
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,400
the i guess we're the pig of apsec how's

153
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
that i don't know if that's

154
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,280
absolute hogs i don't know

155
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,080
but we're able to you know pull in and i

156
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,320
get kind of amazed i mean i don't know

157
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,600
you know just to brag a little bit about

158
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
defect dojo but i i don't know

159
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
of any sort of other tool that is able

160
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,320
to import as many different tools uh as

161
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,160
as defect dojo we're gonna we'll cover

162
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,440
it a little bit but i think it speaks to

163
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,720
the fact that

164
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,360
um you know the community really does

165
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,280
do a lot of

166
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,440
uh support because it's not just us

167
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,880
that's created that i mean these are

168
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,639
contributions that are coming from a lot

169
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,479
of our members and you know some of them

170
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,000
have never picked up python and i think

171
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,280
that's probably part of the cool thing

172
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,800
when we go back to where we both started

173
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,479
which was in you know application

174
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,560
security or secure just just development

175
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,639
and then we moved over um but but it's

176
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,880
getting you know security people to to

177
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,319
actually write code which which i think

178
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,160
is great i mean that

179
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,120
that's awesome and and vice versa um but

180
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,840
but really getting a a view of having

181
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
all your security in one you know you've

182
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,080
got your compliance you've also you know

183
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,199
able to integrate with ci cd uh i mean

184
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,120
the really this tool

185
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,319
we we created it so that you can use it

186
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,160
it's not just something that some other

187
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,600
person's thought of that they think

188
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,120
might be cool no i mean it's it's

189
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,039
contributions that really make your

190
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,440
application security program work uh

191
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
versus you know trying to shoehorn in

192
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,880
something from a vendor which i think is

193
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
where we this is one of the reasons why

194
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,759
we try to create this

195
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,720
yeah

196
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,919
uh going on for the the tech stack um so

197
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,080
you know this started originally as a

198
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,759
django application uh with python 2. um

199
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,759
you know a couple was it two and a half

200
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,599
years ago we made the

201
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,400
time goes by fast very fast

202
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,520
we made that

203
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,680
semi painful move to python three so

204
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,080
that's awesome django two um and we are

205
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,680
working on a react front end but uh

206
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,840
we weren't api first so so i know that

207
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,440
that's one of your first loves matt

208
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,199
but we're getting there you know

209
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,520
and so not all of the things in the api

210
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,039
are in the ui

211
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,360
but but as we work towards that you know

212
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,960
we're going to have a whole refresh of

213
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
our user interface but

214
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,919
me being a little biased i think it's

215
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,440
still quite usable

216
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,240
even though it it's probably been around

217
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,599
the ui has been around for a couple

218
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,639
years now

219
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,280
yep oh it it works very well um

220
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,120
so one of the things just to cover the

221
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,720
sort of features what do you get out of

222
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,800
the box when you open up defect dojo

223
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,120
right or what can you do with it right

224
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
it is a great way to manage your appsec

225
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,639
or product security or whatever you want

226
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,240
to call it program

227
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,919
it has the ability to

228
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,160
store both application information and

229
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,520
metadata

230
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
and even tie in things like compliance

231
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,960
what technologies are driving those

232
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,280
various uh applications there's metrics

233
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,960
dashboards reporting kind of standard

234
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,479
stuff it has os asvs built in we just

235
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,440
ended up talking about os asvs

236
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,199
there's tagging across multiple levels

237
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,639
and across many of the different data

238
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,319
objects so if you do need to customize

239
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,160
it to fit your particular company's

240
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,280
situation tags give you that flexibility

241
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,719
it has a it allows you to have a

242
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,719
historical knowledge of any past

243
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,640
assessments you did so you know you get

244
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,240
a drive-by boss question of what was the

245
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,839
last time we looked at appx well a

246
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,799
couple of clicks and you can tell them

247
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
there's a calendar of activities you can

248
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,640
export to google sheets

249
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,560
there's a rest api that's swaggerified

250
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,240
we have sso with octa google

251
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,720
azure id

252
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,519
saml all of the sort of ways to do sso

253
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,600
there's notifications to jira to slack

254
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
to ms teams

255
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,760
um and you can ingest like i said tools

256
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,720
from

257
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,360
or

258
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,839
output from many many

259
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,760
tools so how many different oh go ahead

260
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,519
yeah i was just just well i don't know i

261
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,000
jumped into you um but yeah

262
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,680
this is this slide here though is just

263
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,320
great like i i can't tell you like

264
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
how many different tools do you use i i

265
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,600
wish we had put up polls because i'd

266
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
like to hear from the audience how many

267
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,160
different security tools they use

268
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,920
i know we can't see you guys but i know

269
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,000
it's got to be quite a bit it's a ton

270
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and you just can't if you have even a

271
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,320
mildly complex environment you have to

272
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,800
have almost all of these and and you

273
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,720
know vendors are creatively finding new

274
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,480
ways to write new tools and open the

275
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,399
open source world as well as we speak

276
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,440
right so

277
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,279
this is not even a comprehensive list of

278
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,880
tools anymore

279
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,320
i think one of the things that we try to

280
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,080
do is resist writing tool-ish sort of

281
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,480
things in defect dojo

282
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,440
you know

283
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
we we you know first we have thought

284
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
about that you know wouldn't it be nice

285
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,519
if it just did it all but then but then

286
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,880
you kind of we're trying to separate

287
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,720
those different concerns and tools do

288
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,800
what they do best and then trying to

289
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,040
make dojo be that presentation

290
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,800
bringing everything together of you yeah

291
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,720
it's kind of a unix way like one thing

292
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,440
to do one thing very well

293
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,360
yep and so

294
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,920
how many can we import over a hundred

295
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
um and growing right and this is huge

296
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,720
and as aaron said earlier this is a ton

297
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,240
of these are community

298
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,279
committed

299
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,920
uh parsers which is super fantastic and

300
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,200
we greatly appreciate all those

301
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,880
community contributions we would not

302
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,480
have a hundred plus

303
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,079
if it was just a handful of core

304
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,519
maintainers

305
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,880
doing these because i don't even own

306
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
half the tools that we import or use

307
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,040
them not on a daily basis

308
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
and the other nice thing the format is

309
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,240
super simple to do here it you know

310
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,120
um

311
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,880
it's probably it may not be the most

312
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,120
elegant way to do it uh but it gets the

313
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,079
job done so you know well and for

314
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,839
picking for initial code contributions

315
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,959
you don't have to write hundreds of

316
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,600
lines of python right it's what

317
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,760
2040 i don't think it's even

318
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,279
you could probably knock out one in 40

319
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,560
lines it's pretty yeah pretty

320
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,480
straightforward and a few months ago i

321
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
even did a template generator so if you

322
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
hop over to one of the repos there

323
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,680
there's a template generator where you

324
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
just plug in hey this is the name of it

325
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,360
and it'll spit out a python template for

326
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,760
you you swap out the fields

327
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,920
put in your test case your your test

328
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,320
file and uh you know now you've got your

329
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,560
your importer and probably the the other

330
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,240
hidden message behind this hundred plus

331
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,079
tools is the fact that

332
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,640
if you get mistreated by your pick

333
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,880
you're like dast vendor

334
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,240
and you don't like them anymore they're

335
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,160
licensing change there's some sort of

336
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,720
issue you swap them out and dojo doesn't

337
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,680
care

338
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,440
like i think the vendors would really

339
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,360
like you to buy their mothership and run

340
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,440
everything through their tooling but

341
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,560
that also embeds you and ties you very

342
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,480
strongly to those vendors so if you want

343
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,040
sort of vendor agnostic ability to

344
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
ingest tools defect dojo is where the

345
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,599
money's at

346
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,959
so okay uh just

347
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,959
automation i mean i think

348
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,040
both of us spend more time in the in the

349
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,279
api then we do i mean that's probably an

350
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,480
understatement

351
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,240
it is

352
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,600
oh i think we're a little old school

353
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,519
maybe you're just a tiny more bit old

354
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,000
school than i am

355
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
yep well and that's to me that's like

356
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,920
it's cool that there's a ui and you can

357
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,279
use things but i want to do things at

358
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,959
speed and that usually means automation

359
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,560
right i want to do things better faster

360
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,399
quicker and usually that's automation

361
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,680
with uh

362
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,360
with tooling because let's think about

363
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,600
it there's there's really never

364
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,040
enough time like i've i have yet to be

365
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,240
on a uh an apsec team or a security team

366
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,079
in general that had too many people

367
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,839
particularly versus say the amount of

368
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,079
devs in the organization or the amount

369
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,800
of assets of uh infrastructure if you're

370
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
just dealing with infrastructure side of

371
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
security right so

372
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
you have to make the most of the limited

373
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,639
resources the people that you have and

374
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,639
this is where automation really is your

375
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,639
friend those things that don't take a

376
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,040
lot of human brain activity just

377
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,959
automate them right and dojo has that

378
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,040
rest api to let you do that where you

379
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,240
can automate

380
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,920
ingesting of tools

381
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,399
like running reports pulling metrics out

382
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,560
and submitting them to you know

383
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
making nice spreadsheets and shipping

384
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
them off to the the appropriate party

385
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,320
all those things can happen all through

386
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,920
the api

387
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,040
and so aaron and i several years back

388
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,200
came with up with this idea of an apsec

389
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,399
pipeline and this is just a generalized

390
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,639
uh example of the flow of work through

391
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,360
any kind of security program where you

392
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,839
at the far left have an intake

393
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:40,959
right where you're taking in the

394
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,720
requests either these are compliance

395
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,680
driven

396
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,600
regulation driven or maybe just you've

397
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,519
decided to test every app every six

398
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,079
months whatever it is

399
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,839
or maybe you know the the ciso says i

400
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,519
want you to test this tomorrow but

401
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,440
you've got intake right and then you

402
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,760
take this incoming work evaluate it to

403
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,440
say what how what and how much testing

404
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,199
do we need to do we call that phase

405
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,120
triage and then once you've decided what

406
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,279
and how much testing needs to happen

407
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,120
you want to run one or more tools

408
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,079
against that target of your testing

409
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,399
push all those results into one single

410
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,399
place a vulnerability repository like

411
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,959
defect dojo and then from there you can

412
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,360
read out of the api or if it's built in

413
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,279
like speaking to jira you can push

414
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,959
directly to jira

415
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,760
or grc tools or metrics and reporting or

416
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,519
whatever you need can all happen now in

417
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,199
what we call the delivery phase where

418
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,560
you're talking to those external

419
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,720
stakeholders which is why you did the

420
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,839
security assessment to begin with

421
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,560
and so here's a real world example

422
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,720
from a kafka publisher look at us in

423
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,639
linkedin where aaron and i collide you

424
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,000
might figure out that's where we did

425
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,120
this

426
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,880
um

427
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,120
but we set up a pipeline where we used

428
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,199
bag of holding to do that intake and

429
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,320
triage um and we also had stackstorm for

430
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,839
orchestration to be quite honest with

431
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,160
you stackstorm was a bit of an overkill

432
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,000
but it was pretty it was cool

433
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,399
and just wanted to mention uh

434
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,160
people might not know but bag of holding

435
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
was an internal develop tool that we had

436
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,639
created which held a lot of application

437
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,839
metadata

438
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,240
um and we liked a lot of those ideas and

439
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,760
actually i took a lot of those ideas

440
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,600
from bag of holding and quite frankly

441
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,360
because that was open source as well and

442
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,120
i just shoved it right into dojo so

443
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,000
before dojo the dojo 1.0 didn't really

444
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,279
have that

445
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,600
you know rich view of an application

446
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,279
that you could get all that information

447
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,519
about like hey what does the bob app do

448
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,279
and right and that's what we took and we

449
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,199
folded it into dojo so essentially those

450
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,120
two became one application

451
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,199
yeah and i almost i i like and dislike

452
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,880
the slide because a lot of people think

453
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,399
oh i have to have two apps and no you

454
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,560
really just need one anymore like at the

455
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,320
time began holding seemed like a good

456
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,560
choice in retrospect uh particularly

457
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,160
with what dojo has in it now i wouldn't

458
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,000
even think about making that well i

459
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,279
think it's that you know that iteration

460
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,880
and evolution process that you go

461
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,920
through you know you're like okay let's

462
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,040
try this that works but it's not great

463
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,120
and so we scrap and move on but we still

464
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,480
were able to take a good portion of that

465
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,399
yep right into dojo yep

466
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,800
okay so that that's a real world example

467
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,639
of a of a knapsec pipeline that was

468
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,279
highly functional for us

469
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,480
um

470
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,800
come on why is this not going there we

471
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,079
go hello there we go

472
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,680
so here's another example of uh another

473
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,160
abstract pipeline this is one um where

474
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,680
it's much more event driven where you

475
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,519
have a developer checking and code up

476
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,720
here

477
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,639
right it's going into stash

478
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,399
stash is gonna send a web hook to an

479
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,000
appsec pipeline which is going to launch

480
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,639
a bunch of containers that have tooling

481
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,480
that data will flow from the tooling

482
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,639
into defect dojo where you can do slack

483
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,680
alerts or summaries to the developers in

484
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,440
the appropriate channel as well as push

485
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,959
those issues to jira

486
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,399
and then here's another example of what

487
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,079
i would kind of call a third generation

488
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,480
much like the previous one event driven

489
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,000
where you have an event source that hits

490
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,519
the apps like pipeline you launch a

491
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,360
whole bunch of containers at one or more

492
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,279
targets and then once again

493
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,160
right this gets dumped into defect dojo

494
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,880
and for me uh having created something

495
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,559
like this before

496
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,400
it was really nice to have dojo there

497
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,079
because quite honestly i got a ui for

498
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,679
free

499
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,599
you do not want to see how i write uis

500
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,280
i'm really good at command line tools i

501
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,280
don't make uis that look pretty i didn't

502
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,799
have to i'm going to shove it to dojo

503
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,199
and be done

504
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,640
and so the the first of the event driven

505
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,880
ones these are some stats that came out

506
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,280
of the running of that tool right we had

507
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,960
or that that pipeline 15 different repos

508
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,559
5100 runs over four months and 2 25 000

509
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,720
container executions and these numbers

510
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,080
are cool but what's really important

511
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,440
about this is

512
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,320
you turned security testing into an easy

513
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,000
button or as close as you can get to an

514
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
easy button so you can just keep running

515
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
these things and that's that's really

516
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,280
important to get the coverage at the

517
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,799
speed that you need

518
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,080
in an apsec program

519
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,360
and then the original one from the uh

520
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,080
large education company um we started

521
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,120
with 44 assessments in 2014

522
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,960
we lost some people

523
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,720
um but actually sped up to 224 and then

524
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,760
in 2016 we actually went up to 414

525
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
losing even more people

526
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,960
so we did the somewhat unthinkable

527
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,400
we got smaller but did more work

528
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,559
and i totally credit that to defect dojo

529
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,080
and the apps like pipeline automation

530
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,200
work we did i don't think we would have

531
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,880
been there without it

532
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,960
no you're still doing spreadsheets yeah

533
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,480
google sheets

534
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,400
with a five-minute load time that's

535
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,640
right

536
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,799
uh so real quick deployment options uh

537
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,320
the first one would be uh dr compose um

538
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,919
you know that that's probably what we'd

539
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,919
recommend for sure for for development

540
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,440
for you know kicking the tires that's

541
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,240
one way to go with it um

542
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,679
you know everybody's very opinionated

543
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,760
about docker um

544
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,200
we have our ways of doing it you have

545
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,880
your ways of doing it obviously make it

546
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,720
your own you can do it you know it's

547
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,880
open source make it work however you'd

548
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,280
like but this will get you um you know

549
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
up and running uh of course we would

550
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,039
recommend a you know dedicated database

551
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,160
but that's one way of doing it

552
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,200
um

553
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,799
here's just another example you know

554
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,559
real world duck composed with one ec2

555
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,840
instance t2 large um my you know rds

556
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,919
and those are the settings and it scales

557
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,080
fairly well um and so we're starting to

558
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,760
get at least some numbers around you

559
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,559
know

560
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,280
how many findings can it actually hold

561
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,160
now dedupe does take some competit

562
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
computation so you know it might cause

563
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
some issues because unfortunately we

564
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,280
still have to use celery um

565
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,559
but uh

566
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,919
you know that's just what we have at the

567
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,760
moment but anyway that that's that's

568
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,080
exact one real world example of compose

569
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,600
uh kubernetes so a lot of folks are

570
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,919
starting to use kubernetes especially um

571
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:56,720
in

572
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,960
uh europe that seems to be very popular

573
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,320
uh amongst that would you say matt yeah

574
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,400
it seems it it seems yeah a lot of

575
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,840
people in europe see i don't know why

576
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,640
that geographic uh

577
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,159
that what we've noticed geographically

578
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,440
makes any difference if you know what i

579
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,880
mean like it's just kind of an odd thing

580
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,360
but it seems like much more of people in

581
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,840
the uh european time zones have asked me

582
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
about

583
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,000
kubernetes yep anyway so you have helm3

584
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,360
support uh with mini cube um really you

585
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,440
can run it anywhere you like uh just

586
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,280
need somebody that knows a little bit

587
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
about kubernetes

588
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
yeah i definitely say that there are

589
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,919
more rough edges deploying defect dojo

590
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,919
to kubernetes than doing a docker

591
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,120
compose and it's if for no other reason

592
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,600
we've had more questions in the issues

593
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,240
or on slack around compose and been able

594
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,159
to sort of work around any kind of

595
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,760
corner cases

596
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,039
than we have with kubernetes just

597
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,400
because of the time it's been around

598
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,280
like

599
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,240
dr

600
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,799
composer's been running

601
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,679
uh

602
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,559
dojo for years and helm is

603
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,760
what a year and a half ish maybe

604
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,039
maybe a little older but yeah around

605
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,120
there yeah so it just hasn't had as much

606
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,239
road time yeah

607
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,480
here another another great example this

608
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,960
this is a massive installation

609
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
i think this is maybe one of our largest

610
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,640
one of the largest ones that i know

611
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,840
about i can talk about publicly yeah

612
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,840
yeah yeah 21 gig database and ingesting

613
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,520
5 000

614
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,280
findings per day

615
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,200
that's crazy number and what's really

616
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,039
crazy is this open source project does

617
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,320
that and doesn't fall over

618
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,440
and then we we used to have god help me

619
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,240
i wrote several thousand lines of bash

620
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,720
called setup bash to do the iron

621
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,640
installs of defect dojo that's now been

622
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,960
migrated to godojo which is a single

623
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,799
binary installer

624
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,280
there's over 160 configurable options

625
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,520
because dojo's best and worst feature is

626
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,840
it's very flexible

627
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,520
all of those options can be overridden

628
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,440
by environmental variables

629
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,200
it's not interactive and it just lays

630
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,000
out

631
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,080
defect dojo on iron like a traditional

632
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,480
vm install

633
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,960
yeah go ahead yeah just so some recent

634
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,200
improvements um of and really what's

635
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,640
coming up there's gonna be a lot of

636
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,159
things but uh

637
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,000
uh we have one guy who's really gone

638
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,679
back through and really tightened up our

639
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,600
parser code he's done an excellent job

640
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,000
with that

641
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,159
the form as far as that goes as best we

642
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,760
can

643
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,919
if you've spent any time in json xml and

644
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,280
all these different formats it's coming

645
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,200
out you know it's not a fun job so

646
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,679
anybody that wants to take it on is is

647
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,440
awesome in our book

648
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,840
um so i give major kudos actually it's

649
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,559
demian that's done a lot of that um

650
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,880
unit tests you know we've come a long

651
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,400
way with those uh we probably

652
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,919
you're never done there you we've never

653
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,440
i don't think you've ever say like you

654
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,120
can't have enough applications you never

655
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,720
have enough unit tests

656
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
but but we are trying to make that more

657
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,880
more and more robust so that we have you

658
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
know more reliability with defect dojo

659
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,720
because you know as we see more and more

660
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,200
organizations are actually using it

661
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,039
and depending on it so we really need to

662
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,679
have that uh dependability

663
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,799
um

664
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,039
reimport that was also a big deal where

665
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,360
you know you can re-import findings um

666
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,799
you want to be able to keep the deltas

667
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,200
of those um and then we've just been

668
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,039
working on improving our d-dupe uh

669
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,000
algorithm there as well um and then jira

670
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,919
you know love it or hate it jira is here

671
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,280
to stay

672
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,159
and so you know

673
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,159
at least now we can group findings push

674
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,440
them as one jira because you don't want

675
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,000
like 10 000 tickets for you know one

676
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,760
across the cross-site scripting on one

677
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,840
page that you know mushrooms out as we

678
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,880
all know um and then i think the one

679
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,640
that we're probably most proud of i mean

680
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,919
we're proud of a lot of different things

681
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,039
um

682
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,080
but it's how many prs we get uh you know

683
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,880
we're not a stale project i i think

684
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,120
just look at all the issues that are

685
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,679
coming it's it's it's actually it's

686
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,520
overwhelming honestly

687
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,440
um yeah i don't care anything else about

688
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,919
that our pr counts in the like 3k range

689
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,159
i think i mean it's it's nuts

690
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,640
it's really nuts in a good way like i'm

691
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,919
thrilled that the community's rallied

692
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,760
around dojo as much as it has it's been

693
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,559
really fantastic

694
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,840
uh just so what's some things are up

695
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,919
that actually already released is uh

696
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,120
authorization model um so we

697
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,640
we really had a very simplistic model

698
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,000
especially when it not because it was in

699
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,200
rackspace but you know that's where it

700
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,880
came out of you know when you're doing

701
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,000
mvp product you so so that's been really

702
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,440
expanded um our api v2 is much more i

703
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,919
would say restful in nature it follows

704
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,000
more standards than our api v1 did it's

705
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,840
a lot easier to use

706
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,360
it was quite confusing to use the other

707
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,240
one

708
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,120
um

709
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,279
we've had our we've come we've done what

710
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,320
two or three now with gsoc um yeah three

711
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,679
these are second

712
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,559
yeah

713
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,640
um and so again that was where we're

714
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,600
trying to work on the react.js ui um and

715
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,480
then we're working on you know

716
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
publishing helm charts uh with every

717
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,799
release

718
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,720
and yeah i know we've been talking about

719
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
community i don't know which one what

720
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,159
else we want to say about that

721
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,480
well here's here's pictures of uh most

722
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,240
of the core contributors my picture's

723
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,520
not up there but that's okay i don't

724
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,120
really care um

725
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,400
and we don't have fred up there which is

726
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,960
a shame um he's a great contributor as

727
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,919
well

728
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,039
yeah

729
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,039
whoops on the pictures um but these are

730
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,039
all the the core contributors who who

731
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,799
day in day out are doing stuff on defect

732
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,799
dojo

733
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,120
um we're a super active project like we

734
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,720
said we've done google summer of code

735
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,520
multiple times for owas flagship

736
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,600
uh the the commit rates are pretty

737
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,159
insane um this is for what a a month um

738
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,480
in this screenshot and

739
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
the other thing is the growth like i

740
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,720
remember when greg and i were like hey

741
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,159
we got to 100 stars

742
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,200
we have

743
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,559
1.8 k stars now it's nuts almost a

744
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,400
thousand forks

745
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,440
um and we this is over the the

746
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,720
last month we did 119 pull requests so

747
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,559
this is a crazy

748
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,279
active project with loads and loads of

749
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,559
contributors and lots of small

750
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,120
contributors which is fantastic we love

751
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,080
people fixing little silly ui wrinkles

752
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,360
typos

753
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,679
whatever like parsers the whole nine is

754
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,559
really been fantastic

755
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,159
so how can you help

756
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,600
start with you know

757
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,679
fixing a parser issue like matt was

758
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,240
saying something small for sure uh we

759
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,320
welcome those sorts of things uh

760
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,080
documentation who doesn't need help with

761
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,240
documentation

762
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,559
so we try as best we can or even it

763
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,320
could just be you know getting giving us

764
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,880
a sanitized version of an output of a

765
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,480
tool because you know obviously we don't

766
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,960
have every tool in the world um

767
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,559
so that would be great join the slack

768
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,880
channel we've got a really active uh

769
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,400
slack channel

770
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,200
or

771
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,799
donate

772
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,559
yeah we don't mind donations and those

773
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,840
those scanner outputs are really

774
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,679
fantastic because we end up wiring those

775
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,520
into our unit tests as well so they

776
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
really help keep the the project going

777
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,400
and the quality up

778
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,080
and

779
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,840
again here are some of our you know

780
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,679
there's just there's almost too many to

781
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,200
even point out but there they are on the

782
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,039
page so you can read them but yeah we've

783
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,360
had lots of great contributions

784
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,279
um obviously core contributors have done

785
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,679
a lot but i mean it's been our community

786
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,919
that's really improved this project

787
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,480
absolutely it would be not half of what

788
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,840
it is without the community

789
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,399
contributions we have

790
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,640
oh and then we we run a full-time demo

791
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,799
you can log in as an admin to defect

792
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,840
dojo at

793
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,240
demo.defectdojo.org with these

794
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,080
credentials it's also up on the readme

795
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,799
and github and log in and play around um

796
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,039
every every day it gets fully refreshed

797
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,440
so like you know don't expect your stuff

798
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,559
to be there

799
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,200
uh today that you put in yesterday and

800
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,159
um i'm surprisingly

801
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,200
giving someone a uh

802
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,279
giving someone an admin login to defect

803
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,840
dojo to any tom dick and harry that

804
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,919
wants to come in and log in and it

805
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,760
stayed up so if nothing else i think we

806
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,200
figured out it's pretty resilient i

807
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,480
remember logging in one day and there

808
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,840
was 27k findings added by i don't know

809
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,720
who

810
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
um and it just it just rolled right

811
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,039
along

812
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,919
well we've we've reached the end of our

813
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,760
exciting dojo story
