[Music]

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,360
okay thank you well um i'm really glad

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,280
to be here uh as

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,240
you say

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,400
good morning good afternoon good evening

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,680
and for for every of you in in the world

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,640
uh well let's let's talk about the this

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,840
talk and

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,400
i'm gonna well first i'm gonna talk

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,960
about a little bit of me well tim talk

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,079
about it but well i'm a systems engineer

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,200
my

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,079
profession i started systems engineer

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,280
i i've been some years in in the field

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,520
uh i've been

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,719
making some some talks for for some time

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,360
now and working in different companies

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,719
but one one thing one one thing

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,120
i like to to

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,199
to

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,239
that i love about the work is that i had

22
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,718
the opportunity to work as a

23
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,798
cis

24
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,680
architecture manager an auditor and

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,200
outdated karma exists

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,640
pentestered

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,720
as a part of the printer's

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,920
pen tester

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,040
team and leading some some red teams

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,000
also

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,439
some research and and that gives me

32
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,720
i believe uh different points of view

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,920
about

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,280
what we do in in the daily work in

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,320
security and that's that's something i i

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,360
really

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,040
um

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,119
try to to get the most of of that vision

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,119
i will share a little bit

40
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,200
well this is the agenda first some

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,840
background how how this this talk

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,880
started in

43
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,520
some basic theory probably the one that

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,159
you have already seen in sql injection

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,719
and blind maybe you say okay

46
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,360
more more of the same but i believe it's

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,560
it's important that all

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,160
that we all

49
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,959
are

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,080
in the same level of knowledge

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,959
and

52
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,080
then we go to see some lab and see some

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,120
some scripts i developed for for making

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,400
this

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,040
this blind sql injection using binary

56
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,480
search algorithm and some extras on some

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,959
other methods that exist in the wild and

58
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,280
some conclusions and talks but i hope

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,040
that the time will will

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,800
be enough well first uh a big disclaimer

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,080
um excuse my pronunciation as i say

62
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
english is not my native language but i

63
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
will do my best

64
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,440
well

65
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,440
this uh this talk appears uh when i was

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,760
making some laps what i was studying i

67
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,159
was practicing and i was making some

68
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,959
blind sql injection attacks but i was

69
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,200
not using tools i was not using sql map

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,760
i was using python and making my own

71
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,239
scripts that's what was part of the

72
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,040
training but the thing was that i was

73
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,680
connecting to through a vpn

74
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,480
through a server the line was not so

75
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,680
fast and it took a lot of time to make

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,000
the the blind sql injection because you

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,319
go one and um

78
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,280
letter by letter asking if it's the a

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,400
it's the b it's the c it's the d and

80
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,959
when you find it you you go on and

81
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,440
what's really really really slow and i

82
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,519
was i had to make a lot of

83
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,400
tests

84
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,760
uh dry and error and i was thinking how

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,879
could i

86
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,480
improve

87
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,959
be more efficient and that that's why

88
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,959
the idea i had to

89
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,319
to

90
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,280
to try to try this the thing

91
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,560
so uh well first some theory as a as as

92
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,159
i as i said

93
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,560
sql injection probably is

94
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,840
a really old exploitation technique but

95
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,159
it's still fun in some applications it's

96
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,360
it's it's crazy when you tell about sql

97
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,599
injection oh that's all that's really

98
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,319
all i i remember chats

99
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,639
or talks i don't know 205 200

100
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,399
that you were

101
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,400
always had the sql injection and still

102
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,880
is in the top always top 10

103
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,280
uh well now it's not in the first it's

104
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,479
in the third

105
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,000
place in the the 2021 but this is still

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
appearing

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,560
and

108
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,199
as you can see it consists in injecting

109
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,360
sql code in this case

110
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,960
or some logic

111
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,600
into some input variable to obtain

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
access to the database and sometimes

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,560
compromise the entire system not only

114
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,479
get some information

115
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,639
and one of the first causes is the lack

116
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,120
of controls that filter the input if you

117
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,600
put some data and that data is not

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,919
filtered probably you could insert or

119
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,199
inject some

120
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,759
uh commands or some data that could

121
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,560
affect the the query you are making uh

122
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,120
in in the in the process

123
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,759
and it works in the application layer so

124
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,000
solutions that work in inferior layers

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
will not protect in your infrastructure

126
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,360
what i'm talking about a firewall works

127
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
in layer three and four it's bordering

128
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,440
and destiny it's uh ip origin destiny

129
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
that won't work with

130
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,440
um a sql injection as a control or as a

131
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,960
protection

132
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,240
if i go

133
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,560
well i use in the lab the the dumb

134
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
vulnerability web application and this

135
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,479
is the the the sql injection part

136
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,280
and it's if you see the code you could

137
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,400
see in in this song that there is an id

138
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,280
this id it's what we are going to put in

139
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
the user id

140
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,440
box and we will submit

141
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,400
what we will happen that the that that

142
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,680
data will go directly to a query

143
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,240
and that's what we are going to inject

144
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,039
because there is no limit and i will go

145
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,560
to some

146
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,840
i don't know it's

147
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,160
the first thing you you you learn when

148
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,120
you do sql injection okay you put an

149
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,000
apostrophe or one or one

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,360
dash dash and the list will be become a

151
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
comment and what happened you get the

152
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,240
data and that's it sorry for the spoiler

153
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,199
for the one who haven't entered to the

154
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,440
to the to the sql injection

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,400
part and that's it it's really simple

156
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,800
if you go to blind it's a vulnerability

157
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,479
that's still found in india's top 10 21

158
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,639
in the third position right now

159
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,440
uh it's a type of sql injection attack

160
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,639
but you ask the database for a true or a

161
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,160
false

162
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,520
answer you just for for a closed answer

163
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,479
and determine and you try to to

164
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,400
determine determine the

165
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,120
in based of the answer what it's the

166
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,919
character or the data you are asking for

167
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,240
we will i will explain it

168
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,360
in a moment

169
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
it's a very cumbersome and slow

170
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,240
technique

171
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,160
um

172
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,360
it's it's inevitable for the way we are

173
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,919
going to extract information

174
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,080
and it's really common to use some

175
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,240
automated tools it's really common to

176
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,120
use sql map but something that happens

177
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,280
when you start to working with some

178
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,160
complex applications the sql map maybe

179
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,960
won't work so you will have to go to

180
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,599
the the to work with the nails to work

181
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,400
with the hands and make some custom

182
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,599
adapt adaptations and and that's where

183
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,840
we are trying to go in this

184
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
vulnerability you will need to protect

185
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,840
not only the input that you are

186
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,720
inserting in into the application but

187
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,199
also the output you are giving because

188
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,400
that output would give

189
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,199
some information to the attacker

190
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,080
and

191
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,039
well if if we go to sql injection

192
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,120
you you could find the error base the

193
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,759
blind base and in the blind bay blind

194
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,479
based you you will find the the boolean

195
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,039
and the uh time base i i will work with

196
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,080
the boolean uh principle in in this in

197
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,879
this lab that i'm going to to talk about

198
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,680
it

199
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,639
well if we talk about sql injection if

200
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,520
if you in the blind sql injection in in

201
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,720
the

202
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,320
in the challenge you have in the damn

203
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,479
vulnerability web application

204
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,440
you see that there is um

205
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,159
a

206
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,399
message that it's appearing the user id

207
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,679
is missing from the database yeah that's

208
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,279
information for us

209
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,600
if you see here

210
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,399
the data it's going sorry

211
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,080
the data is going

212
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,600
through the query

213
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,040
but in the

214
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,000
bottom part you see that the user is

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,279
missing from the database appears as

216
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,920
one response the the the

217
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,399
the id is missing from the database but

218
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,560
also there is another message that talks

219
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,000
about the user id exists in the database

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,880
so it could be interesting to go through

221
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,800
that way and that's the way we are going

222
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,760
to to

223
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,080
to working in the script well

224
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,160
the binary search algorithm is an

225
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,120
efficient algorithm for finding uh an

226
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,000
item

227
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,399
from a certain list of items

228
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,800
uh consisting repeatedly dividing the

229
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,120
half portion of the list that could

230
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,760
contain the the the item you and you

231
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,240
narrow down to one position

232
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
it's common uh

233
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,240
includes a selection of

234
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,080
uh it's uh

235
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,000
it's commonly included as a section in

236
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,240
many programming courses uh probably if

237
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,959
you have study i don't know python or c

238
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,680
or practical or any any language

239
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,480
probably you you will pass through the

240
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
binary search as you probably passed as

241
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,320
the

242
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
tower of hanoi

243
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,839
challenge and make some program to

244
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,200
automatic to automate that that kind of

245
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,079
of of work

246
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,000
if you don't remember the the tower of

247
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,800
hanoi i show you them

248
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,279
and the binary search goes like this you

249
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,640
have

250
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,720
an order list of of items you want to to

251
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,760
search

252
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,240
in in that search we are going to go in

253
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,839
the first line we are going to go for

254
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,880
the six

255
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,279
and we go to the middle one and we ask

256
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,120
the middle one it's it's

257
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,760
greater than or lower than

258
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,560
b

259
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,880
depending on the answer we will go to

260
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,560
the to the

261
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,200
to the mid to the middle and

262
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,720
go for the the space where the

263
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,200
the data we are asking for

264
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,680
is or not and then we will find a new

265
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,920
middle space and from that we will go on

266
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,079
the times that we

267
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,120
that that be necessary to get the the

268
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,640
correct data

269
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,519
uh but let's go to a lab okay this lab i

270
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,200
i don't like this lab because

271
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000
it remembers coronavirus and

272
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
i prefer this lab but this is not true

273
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
this is the lab probably that we will

274
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,760
have more more more

275
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,279
more or less

276
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,640
more

277
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,839
um

278
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,480
in real life and so and so on

279
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,760
what's the

280
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,480
what i have in in my lab it's it's

281
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,240
really simple uh

282
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,079
i'm in a mac

283
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,680
in the mac i have a virtual machine i i

284
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,880
i have a kali linux with python burp

285
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,839
suite

286
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,800
visual studio code it's the dev i used

287
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
to use and on firefox

288
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,279
inside i i load the docker with the dumb

289
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,560
vulnerability web application that has

290
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,000
php and

291
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,760
maria debay uh

292
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,560
my sequel was

293
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,760
more improved

294
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,320
it's it's really interesting

295
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,680
well this is my first testing script

296
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,519
i will work with the um

297
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,920
with the the lap that appears in the

298
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,880
dumbbell vulnerability web application

299
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,000
and i will

300
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,519
go for

301
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,639
in that way

302
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,160
uh i i i want to explain some some

303
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,120
things in this script uh in the first

304
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,639
part from the line one two eight it's

305
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,600
data just the the libraries are i'm

306
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,480
using the proxy because i want to go

307
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,000
through the um

308
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,639
to to get uh that the script passed

309
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,560
through my

310
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,279
verb application the cookies because was

311
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,200
easier to use the cookie that was

312
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,399
already in in the application that great

313
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,079
than creating a logon session so i go

314
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,959
through through that way and then i

315
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,880
make a request to function

316
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,480
uh this request function includes the ip

317
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,600
and a string query type a

318
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,240
an injection string and the query type

319
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,720
that's the three the three variables i

320
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,680
inject

321
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,600
the first one the ip appears here and

322
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,880
the line 10

323
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,120
and the injection string

324
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,519
and according if it's the query type

325
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,880
true or false

326
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,480
uh that will give me in the next in the

327
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,720
next condition in the in the 14

328
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,040
the 14 through

329
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,839
knighting

330
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,680
uh a line you will find the the

331
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,959
condition of the

332
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,480
of this function

333
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,079
and another thing i include it's uh

334
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,079
two injection strings

335
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,920
one it's uh a true injection string and

336
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,639
the other one it's a false injection

337
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,600
string what that i'm doing here and let

338
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
me go through the

339
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,920
through the lap

340
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,880
um

341
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,720
well we are here

342
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,959
what i'm doing here it's

343
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,880
trying to get from um

344
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,199
from the

345
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,519
from the the lap

346
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,760
some information

347
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,360
when i do this when i put the typical

348
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,920
sql injection um

349
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,120
query

350
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,880
i found that this appears in in in two

351
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,560
parts first

352
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,160
i will go to burp

353
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,240
uh i will find

354
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,000
that the query was made here uh uh maybe

355
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,680
uh uh i'm not sure if you could follow

356
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,800
me

357
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,760
uh you could see that i'm

358
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,839
making a request

359
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,160
in this line that it's building their

360
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,279
ability

361
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,680
and here appears the code

362
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,279
that i'm including in the id in the the

363
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,560
source code that i showed you before

364
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,079
and that gives me some some

365
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,600
some response

366
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,279
i'm gonna try for

367
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,480
some data that

368
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,839
if you see the source code

369
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,959
and if it loads

370
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,560
okay

371
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,519
morphe here you are okay anyway

372
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,000
we will go for the search this will put

373
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,759
in my query

374
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,440
if everything works

375
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,959
for some reason

376
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,560
but work it

377
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,320
all the time start failing right now

378
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,000
okay let me see what happens okay we got

379
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,440
our response

380
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,639
uh what i do here is that the query that

381
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,480
we have in the source code i will go

382
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,959
here um

383
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,360
the the query we where

384
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,920
i will go

385
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,079
i will go here to this

386
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,639
this is the blind okay

387
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,600
what i'm inserting here it's the that in

388
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,839
the id i'm

389
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,480
asking select first name last name from

390
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,959
users where the id it's

391
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,160
first it's empty because i close the

392
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,120
first

393
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,160
apostrophe and they are i ask

394
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,759
or a it's equal to a a

395
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,480
that's what i'm including in the in the

396
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,360
data

397
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,519
what happens if i

398
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,279
put um

399
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,920
if the user it's

400
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,959
empty or a it's equal to b

401
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,800
the response

402
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,199
gives us

403
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,360
see

404
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,519
i don't know why it's so slow

405
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,720
i can't understand why

406
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,839
the

407
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,119
purple machine is not working

408
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,119
i'm so sorry about this

409
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,559
let me let me keep on the track

410
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,280
well what i'm doing here it's that i'm

411
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,839
inserting the true the true injection

412
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,319
string and the false injection string

413
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,919
and um

414
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,200
then uh

415
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,720
i asked

416
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,799
if the true injection strings it's valid

417
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,600
so i i i could i could validate the

418
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,840
false and the true one that means that

419
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,000
the target is vulnerable

420
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,240
uh let me see if i go

421
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,840
to a terminal machine

422
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,120
and send it to

423
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,639
we see if

424
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,879
this is working or not

425
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,640
the quarry is being made

426
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,400
the part is not being made

427
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,559
i don't know why it's not working

428
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,879
what is happening here

429
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
somethings

430
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,880
i don't know what's happening with my

431
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,320
virtual machine

432
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,080
uh

433
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,280
well i i will go through to the uh

434
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,320
through the

435
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,600
through the powerpoints i'm sorry uh uh

436
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,679
my machine is really

437
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,120
failing right now

438
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,840
well

439
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,600
what i do it's as i told you i put both

440
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,520
injection strength the true and the

441
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,160
false and that i include the validation

442
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,200
process

443
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,760
uh what gives me if

444
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,039
the target is vulnerable or not

445
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:21,840
and

446
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,120
and

447
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,280
according the validation arguments if

448
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,480
both uh if i could get

449
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,600
a true response and a false response in

450
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,160
in the script that means that target is

451
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,360
vulnerable

452
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,520
now i need to um

453
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,000
to go on to a

454
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,240
sequential blind search

455
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,679
what i'm doing here is that i'm mixing

456
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,840
uh well i'm i'm including here the same

457
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,039
search

458
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,880
but i'm making some some changes first

459
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,080
in the request function i'm asking for

460
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,880
the the same query the ip

461
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,520
and the and the injection string but you

462
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,559
see here i'm including a four

463
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,440
of

464
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,400
a loop

465
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,280
that

466
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,520
have a range from 32

467
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,080
to 126. why i'm using 32 to 126

468
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,720
126.

469
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,880
it's because i'm using the ascii the

470
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,240
ascii table

471
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,039
and from the 32 to the 126 are or the

472
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,320
printable

473
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,200
characters that i could use in in the

474
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,000
loop and

475
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,880
uh

476
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,039
now i'm only trying to get the um the

477
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,760
true requests in my queries

478
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,960
and

479
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,760
i

480
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,840
start in my

481
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,159
this is part of my injection

482
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,799
from the 11 to the 20. it's my injection

483
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,919
function

484
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,600
and in my

485
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,640
main function what i'm asking it's

486
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,679
for each of the characters of the query

487
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,039
i'm gonna make that it's uh

488
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,159
i'm here getting a version

489
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,600
uh of the of the database

490
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,200
um the the

491
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,440
what what i'm doing here it's

492
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,640
trying to get uh the data of the version

493
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,240
and uh the substring would give me first

494
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,320
the the first character

495
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,640
and then the second and then the the

496
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,760
third and so on through the 20

497
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,120
character

498
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,400
and i will get this

499
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,960
character and convert it to ascii

500
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,400
and we'll

501
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,080
ask if this character it's equal to the

502
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,720
character i am i'm asking for

503
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,080
and through that i will start to getting

504
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,280
i will ask or the program will ask

505
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,039
if um

506
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,200
the the first letter of the version of

507
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,600
the version query it's a

508
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,760
if it's true will appears and we will

509
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,640
get

510
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,679
that data and we will print it in

511
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,799
in our

512
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,480
in our script if it's not there we'll

513
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,720
then we'll go to the to the b and then

514
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,760
to the c and then to the d and so on

515
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,000
through all the um 94 uh characters

516
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,120
printable

517
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,520
and so on that's a blind search that's a

518
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,480
normal blind search

519
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,360
and what i'm i'm getting here it's the

520
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,159
query and

521
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,880
then i go to the binary search what do i

522
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,400
do in the binary search this is the

523
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,120
algorithm step by step what i have what

524
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
i have here

525
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,240
i have the bottom the bottom of the

526
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,640
of my

527
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,200
of the bottom of the characters i'm

528
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,559
going to

529
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,600
to ask

530
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,720
and the top one to 126 and there is a

531
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,799
middle and

532
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,520
what i do here it's

533
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,000
that i have three options

534
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,320
one thing that could happen it's that

535
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,440
the car the first character it's really

536
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,080
the middle one it's it's the character

537
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,880
i'm asking for the middle one if it's

538
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,760
found okay then i got the x i got the

539
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,720
character i'm asking for if it's not

540
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,679
that means it will be false i could go

541
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,720
to the second question if it's

542
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,919
mayor

543
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,720
or it's greater than or it's lower than

544
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,080
if it's

545
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,200
if the mid the middle character it's

546
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
greater than the x

547
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,960
it means that

548
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,159
the x probably it's in the first part of

549
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,039
the of the array of the characters i'm

550
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,640
going to ask

551
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,360
and then the middle one will become the

552
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,039
new top so i shortened the list that

553
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,679
of data that i'm asking for

554
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,919
and the third option that could happen

555
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,200
it's that

556
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,159
the the middle the the x is greater than

557
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,760
the mid then what could happen well the

558
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,520
axis in the lower is in the

559
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,120
in the right side and the

560
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
the bottom with the middle will become

561
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
the new bottom and we are going to

562
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,840
shorten and after that we will go to

563
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,400
loop and go to the next uh

564
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,360
to the next character and so on till we

565
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,600
got all the 20 characters in this case

566
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,080
for the version one

567
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,480
what i do in my script uh well

568
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,000
i started first including

569
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,320
two injection screens

570
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,360
strings

571
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,440
why i do this

572
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,640
because in

573
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,039
when you make an a

574
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,720
normal injection

575
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,559
you ask if the

576
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,520
query you are asking it's equal

577
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,480
to

578
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,240
one character

579
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,320
a letter a number or whatever you are

580
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,360
asking for but in this case you need to

581
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,760
try not only if it's it's equal you

582
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,240
you will need to know it it's greater or

583
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,120
lower than so i i create two injection

584
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,240
strings one that it's greater than and

585
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,720
one that it's equal and the difference

586
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,000
in these two injection strings is that

587
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,440
um

588
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,600
what do i do

589
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,559
also i make the two queries but in

590
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,720
different moments the first one

591
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,240
takes me to the first option that it's

592
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,120
that uh the middle the middle character

593
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,320
i am asking

594
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,679
it's exactly the data um

595
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,039
gives me a true a true answer so i will

596
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,640
keep the the middle one and the 32 and

597
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,520
the second query will give me a

598
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,200
greater or lower than if it's uh true

599
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,840
uh that means that

600
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,200
i will need to

601
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,559
um well i include a counter to to

602
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,000
counter the

603
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,159
the quantity of

604
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,960
of course i'm made in and the middle

605
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,080
will became the new bottom or the third

606
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,559
the third option it's that

607
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,200
in the query that i'm asking

608
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,960
the data i have it's uh greater than the

609
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,159
character no it's false okay it's it

610
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,120
false i go to the third one so the the

611
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,240
middle will go uh that the new top

612
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,919
and that's

613
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,400
how the script goes

614
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,679
along through the

615
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,520
through the

616
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,880
through the query

617
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,919
uh this is more or less what we are

618
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,159
asking for uh

619
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,520
when you start asking in in a sequential

620
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,600
search it's the the bottom part you go

621
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,679
the first letter the second letter the

622
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,919
third letter that's the fourth letter

623
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,919
when you go to final research you go to

624
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,159
you go to the middle and ask it's

625
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,760
in what side it is and you go on

626
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,559
what

627
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,279
makes me this um

628
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,880
this approach

629
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,240
that i reduce considerable the the

630
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,000
steps i made

631
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,159
to connect to the to the data and to

632
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,760
dump the data uh

633
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,799
well let me

634
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,760
try

635
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,320
a last

636
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,440
let me see what is happening

637
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,440
see what is happening

638
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,840
with my lap

639
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,640
that will be a last

640
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,240
shot

641
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,840
if we could get uh oh

642
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,679
now we found the problem

643
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,720
okay i believe that will work okay

644
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,399
well we are now on uh and i have two

645
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,840
minutes so i i will run

646
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,120
in the the first script goes to the book

647
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,919
and i go through the target it's

648
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,919
vulnerable okay

649
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,440
then i will go

650
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,799
okay

651
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,919
through the second script the sequential

652
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,200
search

653
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,520
and let's see

654
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,640
how quick

655
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,080
this goes

656
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,320
as you can see i'm getting

657
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,960
one letter at the time

658
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,039
one character at the time

659
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,679
what i'm getting it's the version of the

660
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,320
database

661
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,840
and it took

662
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,760
12 seconds and a half and i made

663
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,559
652

664
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,399
58 requests

665
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,080
let's see how much time and requests

666
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,918
that the third the binary

667
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,879
make

668
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,360
as you can see it's a little bit quicker

669
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
and you see that

670
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,240
it

671
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,399
occurs in 3.6

672
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,200
seconds and 195

673
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,320
requests

674
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,039
you could see also in the verb

675
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,559
the history

676
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,440
all the queries that are being made

677
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,960
as you can see

678
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,240
here appears

679
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,520
the the true the true query and

680
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,159
in the response what i'm looking for

681
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,679
appears in the 84 line i believe in the

682
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,360
85 line this is the data i'm asking for

683
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,679
uh in the response you see this is a a

684
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,039
a 200 response that's okay

685
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,120
the the rest are

686
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,799
failing to

687
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,960
find um a correct correct data and goes

688
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,760
on

689
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,000
all all through the

690
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,919
all through the through through the

691
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,200
database uh just to to make sure that

692
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,760
that's the the data of the the database

693
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,559
or that's the data we are asking for

694
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,440
this is the database we are attacking

695
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:05,870
and

696
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,440
[Music]

697
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,919
and here appears the correct version

698
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,919
that it's uh 10.1.26

699
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,640
and it's the same data that we are

700
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,880
getting here from the

701
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,000
from the sql injection well uh i'm i'm

702
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,159
finished i'm already finished just two

703
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,760
to two things to to to complain to

704
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,039
complement uh first well some other

705
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,880
existing methods

706
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,520
uh well the bisection method it's the

707
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,840
binary search but there are

708
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
other one that you could find in in the

709
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,039
wild

710
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,760
there are really really interesting and

711
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,640
probably more efficient but well that

712
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,960
was not my

713
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,399
my first try

714
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,240
i go to through this

715
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,640
binary search well there is not only one

716
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,600
solution for each problem probably uh

717
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,000
there will be people that will will have

718
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,960
a better uh python kung fu and would get

719
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,919
a better script but that's the idea i

720
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:06,960
propose

721
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,000
uh we can under can underestimate some

722
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,840
program theory just because was only

723
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,240
theoretic and it might be applica

724
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,880
applicable to different situations i

725
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,039
conscious that the process that take me

726
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,840
to the result teaches me more than

727
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,320
running a tool to do the same thing

728
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,880
automatic automated public tools might

729
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,200
not work in every case so it's useful to

730
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,519
have some resources and sharpen your

731
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,279
tools and knowledge

732
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,240
and that's it and then i i wanted to

733
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,919
thank to the to the lima peru chapter uh

734
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,080
they encouraged me to to make this this

735
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,360
chat i was really

736
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,480
worried if if to do it or not uh the the

737
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,000
language it's technical i believe that

738
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,440
i was not sure if this could give

739
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,799
uh

740
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,080
value to you but i i hope you you enjoy

741
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,799
uh with all the problems we had in in

742
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,320
in the process well that's it

743
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,760
i have to to share with you
