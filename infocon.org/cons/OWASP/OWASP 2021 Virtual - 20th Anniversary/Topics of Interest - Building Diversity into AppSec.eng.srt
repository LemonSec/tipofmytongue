10

um

43
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,320
so i'm here to talk about diversity and

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,360
as london i had mentioned diversity is

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,079
more than just gender and gender is more

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,200
than just non-binary it really is about

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,759
diverse contribution to our industry and

48
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,200
community

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,719
and how we can also build that diversity

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,200
as a community and as multiple

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,640
communities

52
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
in order to make the best strongest

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,520
community and workforce to secure our

54
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,570
infrastructure

55
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,959
[Music]

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,200
so

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,599
with that i'm going to introduce

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,440
our panelists

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,959
and each of them can tell us a little

60
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,120
bit more about themselves

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,200
okay starting with lauradonna

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,319
hi hi everybody thank you zai and it's

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,680
really a pleasure to be part of this uh

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,040
great event and this panel you know

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,840
that

66
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,400
as you correctly said

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,599
speaks

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,920
not only about diversity in terms of

69
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,040
culture age or whatever but really in

70
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,920
terms of the contribution that diversity

71
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,800
can bring in industry generally speaking

72
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,720
and in our field

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,319
in particular

74
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,720
i must say that i feel that

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,640
all wasp has diversity in its dna you

76
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,040
know because i remember when i first

77
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,120
entered this community it was many years

78
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,480
ago

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,959
and you know i felt

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,000
really

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,920
let's say i don't know if it's the right

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,760
word but a little bit ashamed that you

83
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,239
know because i entered a community with

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,560
lots of knowledge lots of projects uh

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
lots of discussion going on and i must

86
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,840
say that

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
at that

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,680
time also now really

89
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,760
i didn't understand them all you know i

90
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
i was a little bit lost

91
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,280
but i i always felt that you know i was

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,760
accepted i could say

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,239
whatever i thought even if i was not

94
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,640
really you know the the right thing or

95
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,159
the most update solution for something

96
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,360
and it was really place where i could

97
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,920
speak and i could learn you know

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,720
so

99
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,439
my feeling is that considering this

100
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,439
really you know uh

101
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,480
inner presence within uh ours but

102
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,360
uh

103
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,480
this uh group you know this community

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,599
for all us we are it is women but

105
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,239
diversity and inclusion is really

106
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,238
something that

107
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,839
has brought

108
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,478
the experience within ours before

109
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,040
lots of people to to a higher level you

110
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
know with the possibility really to

111
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,960
speak to share knowledge

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,000
to bring you know whatever you know to

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,919
the community you give you give to the

114
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,680
community something is very useful

115
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,440
something is less but

116
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,600
you feel that you can really contribute

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,960
and give

118
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,840
and i also think that

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,280
since

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,600
the community started

121
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,160
the decision to create

122
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,919
some um

123
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,040
let's say

124
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,960
presence in different continents you

125
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,360
know we have people of course in united

126
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
states so we have people

127
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,600
in eastern country in africa and europe

128
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
was also another aspect that helped us

129
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,000
in reaching more people you know because

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,320
you can really you know what people

131
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,880
think's there you know how they look at

132
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,360
things so you can really support

133
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,759
this cultural exchange

134
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,560
at a higher level so i do think this is

135
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,080
this was a

136
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,479
quite important because also thinking

137
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,840
about my

138
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,880
working experience you know in other uh

139
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,000
along my

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
life working life

141
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,080
i noticed that you know from time to

142
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
time you think that everybody speaks the

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,039
same language because we all must speak

144
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,759
all technical but it's not completely

145
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,759
true because there are interpretation

146
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,800
there are

147
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,520
a culture you know background so when

148
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,199
you say something or you do a

149
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,960
presentation whatever you have a

150
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,000
different way you know uh uh same things

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,639
and pushing or you know or not pushing

152
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,360
so

153
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,280
my feeling is that as i said though as

154
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,600
it's always been you know an inclusive

155
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,560
environment but with our group we really

156
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,000
you know helped lots of women but also

157
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,080
any type you know uh

158
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,600
diversity to be included more here

159
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,240
and another aspect that i think it's

160
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,600
quite important

161
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,280
for our community and for our committee

162
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,160
is also the activities that we are doing

163
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,520
worldwide

164
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,560
in

165
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,000
let's say creating alliances or sharing

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,039
our knowledge or ideas and so on with

167
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,800
other community

168
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,919
that have the same goals you know to

169
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,360
have

170
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,919
diversity on the ground really you know

171
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,479
to bring these things in the on the

172
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,520
field not just to speak about it okay

173
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,599
because there are as they say green

174
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,360
washing there is also diversity washing

175
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,800
around the world

176
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,599
and

177
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,240
so uh all the activities that also in

178
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,680
the different countries with the

179
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
different people we are doing to create

180
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,639
alliances and work together with other

181
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,680
community you know we have here bandana

182
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,400
that

183
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,280
has

184
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,599
created a very strong link also with the

185
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,880
infosec you know girls diversity we have

186
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
the other people that have

187
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,120
a presence in other groups

188
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,080
i

189
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,280
have behind me you know both always we

190
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,000
are a logo but also another one that

191
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,400
it's just one of the other women let's

192
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,039
say your diversity community that i

193
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,000
try to to support at my best

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,960
that is done 4.0

195
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
i want to speak about this because it

196
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,880
introduced another aspect that i'm sure

197
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,759
some other speakers will discuss uh

198
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,280
during this panel that is the connection

199
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,599
on how technology

200
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,400
needs you know to be diverse how they

201
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,960
input and developing and implementing

202
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,840
and creating the new solutions needs

203
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,000
different point of view i'm just

204
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,599
thinking about

205
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,160
uh artificial intelligence for example

206
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,199
but any type of service you know so it's

207
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,520
it's important that we think that

208
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,759
technology is not just a product or

209
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,080
let's call it standard processes you

210
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,840
know because we all know there are lots

211
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,160
of very nice processes to implement

212
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,639
things and to manage and so on but it's

213
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,840
also how they are built how they are

214
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,800
created since the beginning that should

215
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,960
include you know as we include the

216
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,440
security as we include you know safety

217
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,640
we should include diversity at its

218
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,039
early stage so

219
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,399
with these two logos you know my back i

220
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,240
really think that you know there are

221
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,519
lots of

222
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,519
possible inputs that

223
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,640
women in general but of course i speak

224
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,000
generally about

225
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,440
all diversity that we have in our world

226
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,839
can really bring value you know in some

227
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,040
in an area that is just uh sometimes

228
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,000
felt

229
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
quite cold you know this is a technology

230
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,519
so it works no it's it's not this way

231
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,000
again security you know can be

232
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,880
seen

233
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,480
differently from different people

234
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,399
because of different needs

235
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,560
and also for because of different

236
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,360
culture so this is something that

237
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,320
zoe i think it's really a value you know

238
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,399
for our wasp and of course for our

239
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,360
committee thank you very much

240
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,760
very well

241
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,519
yeah and i really i really like this

242
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,880
logos

243
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,320
like that you were able to get that

244
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,240
tell us a little bit about what you do

245
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,600
so hi everyone uh i'm vandana verma i'm

246
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,760
from india and uh

247
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,360
about my experience currently i'm a

248
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,760
security relations leader at sneak

249
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,720
but i am neck deep into ovasp my journey

250
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,360
started way back in 2011-12

251
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,080
where i got introduced to ovasp but that

252
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,079
time i was just thinking that ovasp is a

253
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,240
web testing guide or a top ten

254
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,959
but then after a couple of months i

255
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,000
realized that it's a huge community

256
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,880
somebody introduced me to it and there

257
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,120
my journey started with ovas

258
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,079
and

259
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,640
over the years uh i became a chapter

260
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,120
leader for ovas bangalore then being

261
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,839
part of ovas women and apsec taking care

262
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,640
of a lot of initiatives where we started

263
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,880
a lot of free trainings and we did a lot

264
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,600
of sessions and whatnot and it was such

265
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,000
a fun working with these wonderful

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,959
ladies and i remember being so close

267
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,600
with uh zoe and laura dana where we

268
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,000
where we were hoping into so many events

269
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,680
and talking about so many things and

270
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,600
bringing diversity in

271
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,399
and then

272
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,040
from bringing uh diversity in and from

273
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,720
via which is women and absent to

274
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
becoming a deer supporting these

275
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,200
initiatives where we can be inclusive of

276
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,399
everyone

277
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,040
not just that we are talking about that

278
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,800
let's have women in application security

279
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,120
but anyone in application security can

280
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,760
join from any field from any part of the

281
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,440
world from any color

282
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,279
um in any age group and i remember that

283
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,440
we were giving a lot of free trainings

284
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
as part of oasp and

285
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,160
there were people who were like over 60

286
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
plus and they were so enthusiastic about

287
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,480
learning about application security

288
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
they're like we want to do it we want to

289
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
see how it works we want to see how the

290
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,440
different experiences work

291
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,320
and

292
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,000
post that in 2019 i remember my friends

293
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,399
pushing me to go for oversport because

294
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,880
there were elections coming up and i got

295
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,000
to be on the obash board last year i

296
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,680
served as a

297
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,600
as a treasurer taking care of the

298
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,760
monetary things and everything

299
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,320
and this year i am serving as a vice

300
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,680
chair

301
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,160
so the most important aspect for me were

302
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,800
in the community being supportive of

303
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,320
everything i do and even when we all are

304
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
sharing the information with each other

305
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
and the initiatives that we are taking

306
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
care of

307
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,959
so apart from that i also

308
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,120
run run certain communities like uh

309
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,680
infosec girls which we started uh like a

310
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,160
long back and then we had some up ups

311
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,240
and downs but there were so many people

312
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,560
who joined us supported us

313
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,880
and here we are growing strong with so

314
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,079
many chapters around the world

315
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,639
we also started infosec kids last year

316
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,399
so that we can have some information

317
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,680
from

318
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,839
the cyber security world for kids and

319
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,440
their parents

320
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,560
then everyone was saying that okay when

321
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,639
we talk about girls even though it's

322
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,720
inclusive can we have something for

323
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,519
common people like everyone not just the

324
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,160
people who are in cyber security any

325
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,399
normal person our parents i know that

326
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,920
they have a lot of issues in

327
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,279
understanding the cyber security

328
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,560
concepts so now why i'll tell you one

329
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,200
important thing uh so my cousin brother

330
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,120
bought a chandelier like it was a big

331
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
beautiful chandelier which you can just

332
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,839
hang it on the wall and it was run by

333
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,760
like using a bluetooth

334
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,560
now

335
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,040
uh is it too hard to uh do some

336
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
bluetooth hack

337
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,279
if you are using an outdated software a

338
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,160
lot of times that it's easy so we were

339
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,959
very like it was very fancy and and and

340
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,880
we still have that but we have turned

341
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,440
off a lot of things in that so that

342
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,200
it's just a showpiece

343
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,000
now why it all started i just got a

344
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,839
script from the internet

345
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,480
and on the dinner table i rank

346
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,720
and it was just continuously spinning

347
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,399
and everybody spooked out what has

348
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,320
happened it was very hard to turn it off

349
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,440
because

350
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,880
it was running wire script which was

351
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
running on a loop now these are the

352
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,199
simplest of things but now we have smart

353
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,839
tv smart visas and what not at home so

354
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,680
it's important that we run all these

355
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,440
things and that's how we started off

356
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,040
with infosec diversity where we're

357
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,360
trying to bring security for everyone

358
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
students to elderly people to veterans

359
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,760
to everyone and we've also started a lot

360
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,360
of mentorship programs because

361
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,760
mentorship program is for everyone and a

362
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,279

as my profession i'm working as a lead

393
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360

394
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,720
school new york and besides my regular

395
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,360
job i have worked for

396
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
a lot many communities and i'm currently

397
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,040
also working for many others so i

398
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,000
started off my cyber journey in 2015 and

399
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
that was the time i got introduced to

400
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,839
ovas when i started off my master's

401
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,600
degree in 2015 and

402
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,759
in information security management and

403
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,160
thereafter i just started to go and

404
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,639
attend the meetups that used to happen

405
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,560
and that happened way back in india when

406
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,959
i was in new delhi i just started to go

407
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,800
for monthly meetups i used to be the

408
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,519
only women then started off with two and

409
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,519
then i started to enjoy it like this is

410
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,399
something new curious and something

411
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,880
which has been there for years but we

412
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,279
got to started to know about it from

413
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,600
their time okay something is there in

414
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,320
development there is security everywhere

415
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,800
from physical to cloud to

416
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,480
internet because we started to use

417
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,680
internet a lot after 2010 when we had so

418
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,759
many applications add-ons and phones

419
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,000
have become smartphones

420
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,959
so moving on from that um i got married

421
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,839
i moved to us and i started off my

422
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,320
journey with ovas women and upset along

423
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,040
with interesting girls so i worked with

424
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,680
vandana for i think more than two years

425
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,800
and infraseg girls and i'm still we're

426
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,360
working with her zoe laura donna and

427
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,680
many others in the committee of we are

428
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,839
including jessica also now

429
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,240
so it has been a good journey i got to

430
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,120
learn a lot when i joined via i i just

431
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,079
knew

432
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,000
limited like before i joined via

433
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
actually i knew very limited aspects of

434
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,959
os overalls like mandana said like over

435
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,839
top 10 or just the full form of okay

436
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,160
what's what's always doing but after

437
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,720
joining vr i got access or basically

438
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,640
exposure to different projects

439
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,720
specifically different flagship projects

440
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,319
which are ongoing

441
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,280
currently i am part of vr but along with

442
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,799
that i am part of the education

443
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,319
committee as well

444
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,520
and

445
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,439
right now i am running two other

446
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,319
initiatives so i'm running a women in

447

all the time in the span of two years uh

451
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,240

i have trained more than at least 400

453
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,960
plus students currently in cyber

454
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,440
security so that's my passion to learn

455
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,760
more and to share my knowledge with

456

um yeah so my journey into

475
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,240
information security

476
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,320
cybersec apsec

477
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,880
all of that i always say that the

478
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,960
industry and and all of these things

479
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,400
chose me

480
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,120
i'm a survivor of abuse and violence and

481
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
exploitation and

482
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
in that

483
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,760
what i went through were all of the

484
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,600
things you can imagine in tech

485
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,679
facilitated gender-based violence

486
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,880
the utilization of stalker wear

487
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,559
spyware or if anyone has heard of it

488
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,799
used as spouse wear

489
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,640
all of these things so

490
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,520
my journey in was that i wanted to

491
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,360
understand as someone who didn't come

492
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,440
from a technological background i didn't

493
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,200
have access to

494
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,120
devices until much later than a lot of

495
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,440
other people did i i came from a lower

496
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,799
income background i wanted to understand

497
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,799
how i could use the same things that

498
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,320
have been used against me to harm me i

499
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
wanted to understand how i could protect

500
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,919
others through that but how i could also

501
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,440
teach others

502
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,720
so that i could prevent it from

503
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
happening to them as well and how we

504
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,880
could build that into what we do

505
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,080
i know we'll talk about that a little

506
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,679
bit later on in the panel a little bit

507
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,080
more of that but that was that was my

508
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,200
journey in

frontline communities

into the implementation of the

579
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
technology that is either used for them

580
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,400
or against them whether that be

everything

595

and you know really understanding how

596
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,880
you can channel passion into the

597
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,520
industry and community and i see a lot

598
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,760
of that i see you know so much of it is

599
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
really about the people's drive and the

600
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,240
people's motivations to mentor as they

601
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,120
learn

602
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,039
and to continuously give back such a big

603
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,640
culture i haven't seen another you know

604
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,159
as much in other tech communities um

605
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,400
maybe some social innovation but um

606
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
just like teaching people something

607
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,320
useful answering questions that they

608
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,720
have about specific things making them

609
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,120
think about security gain you know in

610
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,960
development in their business and their

611
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,320
lives depending on who you're

612
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
coordinating with

613
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,320
um

614
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,679
and just

615
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,400
spreading awareness where you can and

616
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,320
knowing that you know knowing that

617
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,200
introverts also play a role and

618
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,440
that's one of the things that i really

619
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,320
love about os boya and diversity and

620
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,039
inclusion being part of owasp because

621
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,480
there are so many projects to which

622
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,640
someone can contribute and they can even

623
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
know nothing about code necessarily

624
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,880
going in because they're you know

625
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,840
looking for whether it be translators

626
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,039
writers um

627
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,840
proofreaders or you know people with

628
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,760
expertise and security that's not

629
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,960
necessarily on the development side

630
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,640
and um

631
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,440
also hackers giving their contribution

632
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,360
in terms of you know their specific

633
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,039
research

634
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,120
and

635
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,480
their specific um

636
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,039
passions and um

637
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,279
they definitely have interesting stories

638
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,600
because

639
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,960
they're just you know really really

640
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,360

642
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,640
you know definitely contribute to a

643
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,200
career path but a lot of people just

644
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,080
really enjoy geeking out of the subject

645
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,960
and

646
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,919
um so yeah

647
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,559
and um

648
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,279
so some of that the activities that

649
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,480
we've had

650
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,200
we've had you know expert speakers in

651
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,480
various

652
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,960
domains sharing their expertise giving

653
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,240
demos giving tutorials giving trainings

654
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,960
also specific tops of talks of interest

655
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,480
we've had hackathons and events and

656
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,799
we're going to have more

657
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,799
and you know really at this point

658
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,679
looking for more feedback on how we can

659
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,159
improve upon this and how we can expand

660
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,720
upon what it is and who's involved

661
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,279
encouraging other people to also take

662
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,799
leadership roles within our diversity

663
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,240
and um

664
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,000
also you know again expanding beyond

665
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,799
gender expanding you know to neuro

666
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,279
divergence maybe to people with

667
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,960
different career paths hacker outreach

668
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,600
and um

669
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,799
so

670
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,960
if you could also you know

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,840
their perspective name one or two groups

680
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,200
sorry donna yeah

681
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,640
i um

682
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,400
you know it was really interesting to

683
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
hear the experience or experiences of

684
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,799
the other you know participants to the

685
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,480
panel because i think that pointed out a

686
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
couple of aspects that i think are

687
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,159
really important

688
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,960
for our community in general but anyway

689
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,760
for

690
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,960
i will i say for everyone

691
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,679
one is connected with the need that we

692
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,440
have to create uh you know awareness

693
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,120
so when we speak about kids for example

694
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,200
uh they will be our future so if they

695
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,480
you know grow

696
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,279
with the perception not fear but

697
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,760
perception of the need to

698
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,440
you know stay safe

699
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,200
safe understand

700
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,279
the difficulties or the needs of

701
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,440
attention that they have when

702
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,840
going through social media and

703
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,880
you know

704
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,080
there will be

705
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,120
a next generation of developers of a

706
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,000
technician or whatever so they already

707
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,400
have inside themselves you know the

708
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,559
perception of what they should do so

709
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,120
it's not something that you have to

710
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,760
construct on but it's already building

711
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,320
them so i think this is quite important

712
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,720
because you know the future is

713
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,679
now

714
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,799
always connected so there is no more the

715
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,720
possibility to go back

716
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,279
as well as also jessica said the need to

717
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,520
create the knowledge also to people that

718
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,159
perhaps it's less used to use

719
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,080
internet or this kind of thing so you

720
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,039
know so they can also suffer problems of

721
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,799
attacks or you know

722
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,679
stealing of identity or whatever so i

723
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,679
think that one aspect that i would

724
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,640
really like to see but we already do it

725
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,360
but you know perhaps we can push more is

726
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,919
really the awareness part for you know

727
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,440
all type of people

728
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,840
and the other aspect that i think it's

729
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,240
quite important really speaking about uh

730
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,000
diversity at this this is something that

731
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,640
i think we should uh

732
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,960
explain always better

733
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,679
is the fact that that uh

734
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,080
you know there is no need to not only of

735
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,520
technical people

736
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,320
you know ashta jessica just show it

737
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,360
vandana just got the second

738
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,159
degree of how you call it a law you know

739
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,120
so there are competencies that really

740
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,880
are not just

741
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,840
security based or technical based and so

742
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,760
on you can have people

743
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,960
uh with low knowledge because this is an

744
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
important aspect to protect yourself

745
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,320
from the community you need people with

746
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,840
the language different languages

747
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,600
knowledge because you know open source

748
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,520
intelligence and you know there are lots

749
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,600
of careers

750
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,520
that we can show

751
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,600
uh to you know

752
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,159
whoever young women or anybody that

753
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,360
wants to enter uh the working field that

754
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,679
is that is important so

755
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,080
what i would like you know to to grow to

756
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,880
see

757
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,399
growing in

758
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,320
in this area anyway and for our

759
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,399
communities really you know this aspect

760
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,279
connected with awareness you know in all

761
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,960
fields not just for

762
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,880
people working already

763
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,640
and also uh

764
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,760
to make

765
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,720
the market itself understand you know

766
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,919
even the

767
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:22,799
uh

768
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,200
industry companies public authorities

769
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
and people to understand that security

770
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,600
is really a wide area you know it's

771
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
becoming more and more

772
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,399
uh

773
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,520
you know

774
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,000
inside everything we do so this is

775
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,399
something that perhaps in the future you

776
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,640
know not only us that we already doing

777
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,880
it in some ways we can improve of course

778
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,279
as always but all the communities should

779
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,799
look at

780
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,440
this is just my one sentence as you say

781
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,679
so true really well said

782
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,919
yeah

783
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,480
yeah i am totally in agreement with

784
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,559
loridana that there are so many things

785
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,159
in cyber security that we can start uh

786
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,320
doing and there are already things which

787
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,799
we all are doing we are trying to do our

788
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,919
bid by supporting the community because

789
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,760
it's it's all starts

790
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,159
from the seed where we sow the seed and

791
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,640
slowly and steadily the plants

792
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,520
grow to become the trees and that's what

793
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,679
we are trying to do where we started off

794
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,919
with women in apsec where we had few

795
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,080
people joining those calls way back in

796
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,840
2015-16

797
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,360
i remember

798
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,399
being on calls uh with you lord anna and

799
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,080
zoe and then there were a lot of people

800
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,960
chiming in and now if i see we have

801
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,440
jessica to ask that to everyone growing

802
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,600
and we have not just grown and women

803
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,960
washed women in an abstract but we are

804
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
collaborating with that's a cyber

805
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,799
preserve we are collaborating with the

806
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,880
university girls and so many other

807
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,000
communities uh in even in italy and many

808
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,080
other places where we are trying to be

809
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,159
there and even with a lot of other

810
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,679
places where

811
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,880
we say okay let's have a free education

812
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,120
free cyber security content training for

813
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,600
these people and yes when we talk about

814
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,279
cyber security it's not just about

815
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,519
application security but so much more we

816
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,760
are trying to target trying to educate

817
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,840
developers about cyber security and

818
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,360
that's when obaspen has a huge amount of

819
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,840
support and efforts to kick that start

820
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,000
and even i recently started a project

821
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,159
about developer outreach program where

822
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,080
we can have more developer becoming part

823
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,399
of a wasp because they are the people

824
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,640
who know the environment well and if

825
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,880
they know that yes this is how things

826
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,679
can be moulded around security we can do

827
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:42,720
wonders

828
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,120
and at the same time it is important to

829
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,440
be sure of what law has to entail and

830
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,880
uh what different areas are are can be

831
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,960
targeted like um

832
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,240
i talk about iot iot space is becoming

833
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,519
huge

834
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,919
and even uh when we have these devices

835
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,399
near us and in the organization it

836
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,240
becomes important to understand their

837
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,720
security so how we can educate people

838
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,840
around that

839
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,320
it becomes important so these are these

840
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,840
are just my two cents on it

841
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,320
that's true yeah and also you know

842
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,200
potential implications of you know

843
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,600
certain ml um

844
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,840
you know voice recognition what are some

845
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,279
indicators i guess

846
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,000
it's a little bit more more um fire

847
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,919
fresh but um you know building in

848
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,919
differential privacy and seeing what

849
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,559
developers are doing with certain um

850
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,480
both you know with certain controls and

851
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,080
very very spec

852
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,559
specific domains specific frameworks

853
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,640
specific domains

854
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,919
but also um

855
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,559
just knowing the different environments

856
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,679
and nobody can realistically know nearly

857
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,919
everything but you can always learn from

858
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,720
each other and always build and

859
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,360
you know figure out how to solve complex

860
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,000
problems in a complex way but in real in

861
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,840
real

862
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,840
time bringing in you know the order to

863
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,720
complexity is a you know it's a big

864
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,840
theme in um

865
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,799
my enthusiasm about the industry

866
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,159
breaking down a complex problem

867
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:24,960
and

868
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,320
astha i'm excited for your for your um

869
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,399
response especially since your professor

870
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,559
and you have so many students who look

871
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,000
up to you and who have learned and

872
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
who've gotten placed in their first

873
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,480
cyber jobs

874
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,559
thank you zoe

875
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,600
um

876
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,440
yes i think definitely a few of the

877
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,760
ideas that have come to my mind is

878
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,600
because of my students like because when

879
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,679
they are learning i get to see the other

880
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,960
side how they are absorbing the

881
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,960
information so again when i when i see a

882
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,120
community like we are and they are which

883
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,320
which is now

884
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,519
so diversity in apsec when i say i see

885
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,840
as a warm community where there is a

886
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,399
safe place for everyone to come

887
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,280
i think specifically for anyone who have

888
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,359
like let's say career gaps and they want

889
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,040
to build a career in appsec or in

890
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,918
security uh how we can guide them

891
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,359
because we have so many experts in owasp

892
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,440
already and in via itself we have laura

893
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,480
dhanna we have bandana we have zoe and i

894
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,918
know we are we have other community

895
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,440
members as well who are equally

896
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,918
experienced with so many different uh

897
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,079
domains so i think definitely they can

898
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,760
share their expertise they can share

899
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,399
like

900
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,879
they can be mentors to them and at the

901
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,679
same time something like an open house

902
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,399
for people where they can just come and

903
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,960
share what they want to learn and

904
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,839
and we like we have now experienced so

905
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,239
whatever we have learned from ovals like

906
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,239
giving them the exposure of learning

907
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,320
more about the flagship projects and and

908
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,280
to be honest before i was part of owasp

909
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,320
i had very limited exposure even though

910
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,240
everything is on the website you get to

911
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,400
know more when you become part of it and

912
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,760
i think i've learned a lot from the

913
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,160
spotlight series different projects like

914
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,040
asps we have dependency check we have

915
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,119
zap zap is already known but but still

916
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,200
there are a lot many projects if people

917
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,000
get to learn and if we can provide them

918
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,760
those workshops they'll get to know like

919
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,079
oh which which particular security tool

920
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,119
can be used at which aspect of

921
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,599
application security or let's say

922
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,079
overall development and operations like

923
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,720
let's say from design to development to

924
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,760
let's say code review testing operations

925
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,520
so how different different tools can be

926
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,599
used in fact we have a standard for

927
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,200
logging as well we have an overall

928
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,440
standard for logging as well so making

929
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
people more aware about different roles

930
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
and responsibilities that they can take

931
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
based on their passion based on their

932
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,320
interest and then of course we have

933
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,000
access to our flagship projects and

934
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
different projects from there they can

935
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,079
learn they can learn from the experience

936
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,160
of the already present leaders in the

937
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,400
industry and plus open house sessions

938
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,640
study groups can can really help them

939
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,960
because i know when we are alone we are

940
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,800
lazy but when we have a group we have

941
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,359
people to motivate us so this is

942
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,359
something i want to share from my site

943
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,680
it's very true very well said yeah there

944
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,760
are a bunch of projects um and

945
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,720
you know

946
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,880
how is anyone gonna know coming into the

947
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,119
industry or community that all those

948
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,079
projects exist or really most of them

949
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,240
and how they can be useful

950
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,520
you know how could they could be used

951
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,320
for as a hobby initially depending

952
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,079
um or how they could be used for their

953
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,079
organization

954
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,160
especially startups how they can

955
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,480
integrate certain ones and then save a

956
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,040
bunch of costs depending

957
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,400
um

958
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,560
but yeah and now there's a project

959
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,960
integration standard of how they all

960
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,200
kind of come into play

961
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,320
which is very very useful very helpful

962
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,760
and um

963
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,839
the various talks and bonding has given

964
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,560
talks in that area as well

965
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,119
um yeah i mean a lot of it is just

966
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,400
you know reaching people where they are

967
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,240
no matter where it is

968
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,720
and therefore people with different you

969
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,720
know experiences are a major asset to

970
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,440
our community and being able to do so

971
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,760
again whether it be devs

972
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,960
devs in specific areas the sysadmin

973
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,640
network

974
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,800
um

975
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,480
so you know somebody from outside of

976
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,800
tech

977
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,480
it's so rapidly moving that at the end

978
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,000
of the day it's about community and

979
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,920
willingness to learn

980
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,560
and also you know the drive to give back

981
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
eventually i feel like motivates a lot

982
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,920
of us

983
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,760
because we want to give but you know in

984
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,800
order to really give we need to you know

985
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,280
build the skills ourselves and continue

986
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,359
to grow and because nobody knows

987
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,200
everything i always say

988
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,000
um simultaneously be a mentor challenge

989
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,800
yourself possibly do it especially with

990
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,040
people we're all prone to some sort of

991
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,960
imposter suture because everything moves

992
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,320
so quickly

993
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,920
but um

994
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,920
always push yourself to try to mentor

995
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,160
someone on something or teach someone

996
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,680
something even if you don't think you're

997
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,280
ready because it's also a great way to

998
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,160
solidify your your own learning

999
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,720
so simultaneously be a mentee and a

1000
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,920
mentor at all times in something and

1001
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,720
it's just a good way to stay sharp

1002
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,599
um and so you know stepping outside of

1003
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,000
the day job and doing that

1004
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,680
as an extra layer

1005
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,640
layer of

1006
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,119
enthusiasm and passion

1007
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,240
and that's really what owasp is

1008
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,359
um

1009
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,920
i think for a lot of us i think many of

1010
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,440
you will agree

1011
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,000
because jobs can change you know whether

1012
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,320
it be you wanting a transition you're

1013
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,280
wanting to try something else or

1014
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,680
unfortunate layoffs

1015
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,359
