00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,759
okay hi everybody this is a video um

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,400
i'm like uh like the monster i'm a cyber

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,359
security enthusiast and i've been

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,160
doing this for the last 15 years

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,880
and focused on data security most of my

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,920
time

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,840
and actually i worked a lot in data loss

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,519
prevention

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,960
so

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,840
just a moment

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,520
and

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,960
recently

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,680
we came across this idea of building uh

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
what we call today a security knowledge

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,200
graph and

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,440
first of all i wanted to share with you

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,640
what's a knowledge graph and why is it

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,719
maybe an important thing to

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,000
to consider when you um when think about

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,160
your cyber security program

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,960
so a knowledge graph in the purest form

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,160
and as google and others defined it

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,520
is a structured data which can create

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,479
relationships between nodes and

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,400
between between the nodes that compose

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,520
this graph

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,760
if you've done the computer science you

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,560
came across this idea a lot in in the

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,680
classes

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,799
and

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,479
there are a lot of

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,600
good use cases that you can apply

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,200
a graph to one of that use cases in in

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,400
my opinion and a very good use case for

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,119
it

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,560
is trying to

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,640
see and understand the cyber security

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,960
landscape of your organization and this

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
is why the topic for today is called

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,720
your organization the security as a

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,640
security knowledge graph or as a

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,840
knowledge graph

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
because you can actually

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,640
um

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,360
think of it in in this particular form

47
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,720
and the concept of knowledge graph

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,320
uh creates this

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,680
interlinked

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,079
description between assets between

51
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,040
objects something then you can later

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,119
explore and navigate

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,280
so

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,000
just a moment

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,160
some popular knowledge graphs so that

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,959
you can actually you know get an idea of

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,720
parts and knowledge graph

58
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,200
were built already and they are applied

59
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,800
at scale in in in the world and

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,920
first

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,840
the first knowledge graphs that we came

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,760
across were in 2007 when dbpdi and

63
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,120
freebase

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
created this knowledge crafts where you

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800
could actually explore

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,319
uh and and

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,120
explore knowledge in

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,879
in in a graph way

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,120
so they relied on collecting data from

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,760
wikipedia from other sources but mainly

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
from wikipedia and public data and

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,200
they've put all of that in a way that

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,319
you can

74
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,959
look at one piece of information

75
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,800
and from that specific piece of

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,760
information you can explore other

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,599
connected data to it then in 2012 google

78
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599
introduced their knowledge graph which

79
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,360
was called exactly the google knowledge

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,640
graph

81
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,319
they also

82
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,239
ingested a lot of data from from

83
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,040
wikipedia freebase and some other

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,640
sources

85
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,360
and of course they came up with some

86
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,640
with some concepts and protocols to work

87
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,280
with the data that's in a graph later on

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,760
uh other companies have adopted this and

89
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,480
i'll be i'll be uh talking about them in

90
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,360
a in a few in a few moments but you also

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,239
have

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,159
geonames uh it was open source somehow

93
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,000
and you could actually explore

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,560
geographic areas entities and features

95
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
in in a knowledge graph

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
and another big company which is on the

97
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,239
text uh is creating a fact forge which

98
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,120
is

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,200
a knowledge graph for facts that you can

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,560
actually explore

101
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,799
and one of my favorites as i listed here

102
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,920
is chrome rom research is is a

103
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,439
note-taking app but the idea behind it

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,879
is very very nice it is

105
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,840
a way to explore uh the notes and the

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,599
and and the notes that you have and you

107
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,879
take to all explore them uh in in a

108
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,959
connected way so if you created

109
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,640
something that you know for example you

110
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,759
have put in a confluence page uh and

111
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,959
then reference some other uh resources

112
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,120
rom will actually uh create this

113
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,520
relationship and will allow you to

114
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,759
explore that specific

115
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,560
data the notes that we have in um

116
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,840
in a very nice graphical graphical way

117
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,440
so

118
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,040
when we think about

119
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,960
the idea of the knowledge graph and the

120
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
fact that can actually you know

121
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
have all of this in in a graph

122
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,320
and then we look at the cyber security

123
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,560
industry and we look at the tools and

124
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,479
solutions that we can use on a daily

125
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,520
basis

126
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,680
you start to realize that actually there

127
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,840
is a big discrepancy on how we think

128
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,720
about

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,280
or how we should think about our our

130
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,600
infrastructure our organization our

131
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,639
digital assets and what we get uh when

132
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,560
we look at the tools and solutions that

133
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
we have there

134
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,960
and

135
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,400
the cloud itself

136
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,720
and all these assets that we use today

137
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,280
think about drops think about octa think

138
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,600
about i don't know even github and of

139
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
course aws google cloud and microsoft

140
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
azure the big the big

141
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,360
public cloud providers

142
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,639
all of them

143
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,720
offer you

144
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,800
almost unlimited ways of generating data

145
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,360
and using their resources and they

146
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,680
became the backbone of the internet of

147
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,400
the digital world now and our entire id

148
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
infrastructure even on prem

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,120
is always connected you always have the

150
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,720
end points the laptops they are

151
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,960
connecting to your infrastructure to

152
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,160
your network

153
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
and they are connected right even though

154
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,400
we see it as a list of the inventory in

155
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,440
a solution uh they're not just that

156
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,319
and still with this in mind when you

157
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,919
look at all of this

158
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,280
most of the times

159
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,039
data security

160
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,800
posture and all of that is you know

161
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,240
is analyzed

162
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,160
separately is

163
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,039
always considered to be separate which

164
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,720
is not the case

165
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
at all

166
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,600
and we

167
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,840
we're missing a lot of things when we

168
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,800
don't analyze data in a context and we

169
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,919
somehow

170
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,720
have

171
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,199
you know uh we have

172
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,400
the duty

173
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,960
to think about all of this in in a

174
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,080
relationship

175
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
who has access to those virtual machines

176
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,720
what identities were provided

177
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,000
provisioned by um i don't know maybe by

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
octa

179
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
what um users um

180
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,280
or what systems have vulnerabilities are

181
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,840
they misconfigured misconfigured in

182
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,919
terms of are they publicly exposed or

183
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,240
not do they allow access to my

184
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,800
production environment all of this

185
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,039
can be easily deducted from from a

186
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,880
knowledge graph while it's very very

187
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,120
hard to be deducted from a list of

188
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,080
issues

189
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
and if you look at the big cloud

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,560
providers today for example or other

191
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,960
sources of data you can actually see

192
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,800
that this is still a problem if you look

193
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,240
at the instances in aws they are still a

194
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,319
list of instances telling that if

195
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,560
they're public or not but they don't

196
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,520
surface the fact that a specific vm can

197
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,120
be connected to a data repository

198
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,960
meaning something that stores data for

199
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,080
you

200
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,120
okay

201
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,520
so we talked about why it's important

202
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
and why we should think about perhaps in

203
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,840
the in in cyber security

204
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,160
one of the reasons

205
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,840
i came up with the

206
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,360
with this talk

207
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,520
is that we all

208
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,400
at least start to think about the graphs

209
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,360
and and cyber security because applying

210
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,160
knowledge graph to cyber security will

211
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,080
definitely improve everything that you

212
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
do because you actually get a more

213
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,560
organized way of looking at data you

214
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,120
know and you actually get a map a

215
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,840
topology of all your digital assets so

216
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,720
imagine if you could import and create a

217
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,680
mapping

218
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,199
not just of

219
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,160
your laptops but also of the people that

220
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,639
have access to those laptops or

221
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,479
endpoints um what type of

222
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,120
vulnerabilities are in that specific

223
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,599
endpoint are they allowed to access you

224
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,840
know production

225
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,199
environment all of this can can be

226
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,319
surfaced

227
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,199
from

228
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,520
a contextual view of all of these

229
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,000
digital assets you know

230
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
and

231
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,599
one of the things that can result of all

232
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,719
of this is that if you create a model

233
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,039
that you can later you know use

234
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,880
like an abstract layer you could

235
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,440
actually import data even from

236
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,240
from your like workday if you use

237
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,880
workday or personal uh for onboarding

238
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,399
people in your company

239
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,760
and you could use that as an hr

240
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,360
tool

241
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,560
so

242
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,040
why is a knowledge graph relevant to

243
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,160
cyber security

244
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,279
it is hard to explain

245
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,519
why would someone once think want to

246
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,040
think about the knowledge graph when

247
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,120
they apply that to cyber security but

248
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,519
i'm just presenting here a scenario

249
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,680
which will somehow

250
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,560
you know make you think about it if you

251
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,200
have an oppa user identity and that's an

252
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,440
identity that's been provisioned by octa

253
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,959
who has access

254
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,880
of course they need to work it's your

255
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,200
employee and they need to work and they

256
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,640
have access to a laptop and with the

257
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,160
access to that laptop they have

258
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,080
configured a git repository where they

259
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,240
can push their work to right

260
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,440
and they also have access to a

261
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,080
production environment which is

262
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,720
probably storing sensitive data

263
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
and that specific endpoint

264
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,279
uh can connect to that specific aws

265
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,480
production account and can generate uh

266
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
maybe i don't know or maybe can can

267
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,399
change the configuration there if

268
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,240
somebody gets access to that specific

269
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,200
laptop and it has outdated packages and

270
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
it allowed that then someone cannot get

271
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,000
access to your aws production account

272
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,040
just because they had you know access to

273
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,519
a system and that allowed not just

274
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,440
lateral movement but actually moving

275
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,519
from on-prem to cloud

276
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,240
and and that's something you totally

277
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,959
missed in a lease-based solution

278
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:25,760
so

279
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,959
a graph

280
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,720
from

281
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,560
from my point of view

282
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,399
will definitely make that

283
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,880
very very obvious for you and will allow

284
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,760
you

285
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,000
to see the context and think about the

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,320
context of that specific issue for

287
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,920
example here

288
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,240
i just wanted to show you something uh

289
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,200
which

290
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,640
which is actually

291
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,279
um at the base of a graph system and the

292
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,680
fact that everything is connected so we

293
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,360
have here in the center a virtual

294
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,320
machine

295
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,640
that can be accessed from the internet

296
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,480
because that's the way the security

297
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,160
groups are configured and that's the way

298
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,000
the ports are opened

299
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,040
but also uh this specific virtual

300
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,320
machine

301
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,480
can also connect to s3 buckets you know

302
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,800
and they can expose sensitive data so

303
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,720
this is a virtual machine exposed on the

304
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,040
internet either to port 22 or to port 80

305
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,480
and it's allowing access to an s3 bucket

306
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,720
that may contain credit card numbers if

307
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,519
you think about it and also

308
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,839
if you can ingest data from turnable or

309
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,600
from um

310
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,839
i don't know rapid seven data that can

311
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,959
tell you hey this virtual machine is

312
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,160
also

313
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
using outdated packages

314
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,760
then you can

315
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,959
you can have

316
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,920
a better and richer understanding of

317
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,600
your cloud infrastructure

318
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,399
because you know that in the context of

319
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,680
this specific

320
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
issue that this machine is exposed to

321
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,600
the internet and connecting

322
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,519
to an s3 bucket and a production

323
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,720
environment

324
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,040
database in production environment

325
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,200
there's also this problem

326
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,360
that it has outdated packages or

327
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,200
exploitable packages

328
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,000
and this is something you definitely

329
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,680
miss a lot

330
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,560
if you cannot think about your cloud

331
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,959
security in a connected way

332
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,519
and that's one thing just for the cloud

333
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,519
but all of this um

334
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,279
access to the system

335
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,200
was either provisioned through

336
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,880
aws identity in

337
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,399
access management

338
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,920
or you used octa to provision the user

339
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,680
and to allow access

340
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,760
to all of your infrastructure meaning

341
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,800
the aws accounts meaning maybe the

342
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,639
access to the endpoint

343
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,680
meaning access to dropbox and and other

344
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,519
sources or other

345
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,320
sas applications that your organization

346
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,440
rely on to function normally so all of

347
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,519
that can be factored in a security

348
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,600
knowledge graph and

349
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,800
in and when you do that it can surface

350
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,440
all of these issues of misconfigurations

351
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,959
vulnerabilities

352
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,920
analyzing data in context is easy in

353
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,519
that case

354
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,200
what does a security knowledge graph

355
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,440
bring to cyber security like the big the

356
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,800
big picture

357
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,959
first of all there's this saying in

358
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,040
cyber security i'm pretty sure a lot of

359
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,800
you have heard it

360
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,920
that you know attackers and bad actors

361
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,480
always think in graphs while we trying

362
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
to protect our infrastructure and our

363
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,920
organization

364
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,320
we think in lists and we think okay we

365
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,360
have this specific vm let's see how an

366
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,320
attacker will not be able to exploit it

367
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,639
it doesn't work like that for them no

368
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,839
they try to find the weakest link either

369
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,560
if it's a human uh error or if it's a

370
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,880
misconfigured environment and from that

371
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,800
point on they they try and they start to

372
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,680
uh

373
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,880
to go

374
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,120
uh in different places

375
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,360
trying to get access to the data and

376
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,079
maybe exfiltrate all of that data

377
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,720
when you start thinking in graphs

378
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,240
and when you start thinking that your

379
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,279
organization is a connected one

380
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,959
you actually start to understand that if

381
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,800
somebody gets access to that specific

382
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,199
piece of ip or to that specific ip asset

383
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,440
it might pose a problem for your entire

384
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,000
organization not just for the fact that

385
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,240
okay they can take data from there but

386
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,720
maybe they can get back to data

387
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,120
even on-prem in some cases

388
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,480
another thing that

389
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,199
a knowledge graph can be used for and

390
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,720
it's very helpful

391
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,959
it it allows you

392
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,040
and if you create the proper connections

393
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,920
to data sources it allows you to put

394
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,680
almost unlimited

395
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,560
data in the graph which means the more

396
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,639
and more data you put in the graph

397
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,560
the richer and

398
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,160
more pertinent

399
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,639
the responses and the analysis of your

400
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,680
cloud becomes so you're not going to be

401
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,240
thinking about an identity provision for

402
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,279
your new employee as a single entity but

403
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,600
you are going to be able to explore

404
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,079
what access it is allowed what type of

405
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,880
access and how granular is

406
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,680
provisioned should somebody from

407
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,560
accounting have access to

408
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,720
a production environment that stores

409
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,240
customized data

410
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,600
in google cloud most likely no

411
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,320
if you if you can surface all of these

412
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,680
issues

413
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,480
then

414
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,199
you get what we call a true visibility

415
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,120
into all your digital assets because you

416
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,040
can explore those in the cloud

417
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,079
and that's

418
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,800
a pure visibility not just you know a

419
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,399
list of

420
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,800
assets that you can explore it allows

421
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,720
you to see the

422
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,920
the way your assets are connected and

423
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,120
how they interconnect with other assets

424
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,040
and resources

425
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,279
and of course like i said earlier this

426
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,240
contextual analysis of digital assets

427
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,920
can also surface vulnerabilities and

428
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,040
misconfigurations easily so think about

429
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,519
the use case with turnable or even if

430
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,480
you use sneak or vira code to scan for

431
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,560
vulnerabilities in code you could

432
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,759
actually import the github repository

433
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,720
and the results of the scanning results

434
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,639
the results of the scan

435
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,600
from vracode could be actually factored

436
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,240
in the graph that you have

437
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,279
you can also automatically classify data

438
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,519
so you can create some classes and you

439
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,920
put everything there which allows you at

440
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,480
later stage to you know to

441
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,360
easily interact with that data based on

442
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,639
those classes

443
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,639
and one of the things that we've seen it

444
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,720
helps a lot when you think about all

445
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,120
your cyber security program in a graph

446
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,560
way as compared to to to analyzing

447
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,639
thousands maybe hundreds hundreds of

448
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,680
thousands

449
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,920
of logs and data

450
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,880
it improves the job of uh security

451
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,480
operating center

452
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,240
um

453
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,480
person or a security analyst just

454
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,839
because it allows them to um you know to

455
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,199
speed up

456
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,439
coming up with with facts about that

457
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,439
specific issue and this is a big thing

458
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,400
because

459
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,959
you spend a lot of time and if you ask

460
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,480
me today

461
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,880
it's already unmanageable all of the

462
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,640
data that comes out of the security

463
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,119
system cyber security tools all of the

464
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,760
logs and alert fatigue that you get out

465
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,400
of these tools it's it's not humanly

466
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,880
possible to you know to just digest and

467
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,799
come up with a good uh analysis

468
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,679
based on on data that's stored in list

469
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,080
or in time-based um

470
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,120
systems

471
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,960
while if you can do that in a graph

472
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,480
system it totally changes you know the

473
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,559
thinking about where that problem is

474
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,440
so

475
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,919
imagine

476
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,960
for yourself or for your organization

477
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,520
what could actually this mean so imagine

478
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,480
that you have

479
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,080
some cloud accounts in azure and google

480
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,400
and if you look at some security tools

481
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,960
or if you rely on the solutions that the

482
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,679
public cloud providers are offering you

483
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,400
you're going to end up having you know

484
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,880
an overview of a list of

485
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,080
maybe a few hundred or thousand assets

486
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,200
but

487
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,360
when you think about a knowledge graph

488
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,840
that could power and make you understand

489
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,360
your enterprise

490
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,919
then there's virtually no limit with

491
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,440
what you can put there you can you can

492
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,640
put

493
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,280
data from box you can put data from your

494
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,440
git um your git repository you can

495
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,200
decompose

496
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
the cloud infrastructure that you use in

497
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,760
different layers meaning you can look at

498
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,280
the infrastructure the service then you

499
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,240
can have

500
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,559
the platform as a service as another

501
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,200
layer and definitely you can even have

502
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,280
the applications which are running in

503
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,559
the cloud

504
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,080
be part

505
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,440
of your

506
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,760
organization security knowledge graph in

507
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,880
the end

508
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,480
you will actually

509
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,320
know that okay

510
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,160
i have

511
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,360
some

512
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,559
vulnerabilities in this specific package

513
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,640
which is part of this specific

514
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,559
application which is deployed in a

515
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,559
kubernetes cluster in my ebabled

516
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,200
production and you will actually get a

517
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,520
map of all of this which will allow you

518
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,000
to see the problem not just deduct it or

519
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,720
wait for for it to be a problem and you

520
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,520
could

521
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,320
prioritize the mediation and definitely

522
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,799
improve your cyber security program

523
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,160
and

524
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,640
of course all of this should rely on

525
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,960
some technology and the available

526
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,039
solutions that are

527
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,799
today out there

528
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,919
are either

529
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,400
you know open source and require your

530
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,960
effort to be able to implement it

531
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,200
or you could actually leverage some of

532
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,640
the technology

533
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,039
um because there are technologies which

534
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,799
can be leveraged as managed services

535
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,400
one of the most popular

536
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,120
uh solutions that it's used like a graph

537
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,200
systems so first of all you will need

538
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,039
the graph database or graph system to

539
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,039
store all of these nodes and the

540
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,760
relationship between them one solution

541
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,080
is to use a parting pop this is a very

542
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,400
uh mature and

543
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,720
already it has like i think almost 10

544
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,520
years of history it's it's a solution

545
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
that works pretty well

546
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,640
and

547
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,440
you will have to manage all of it and it

548
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,840
relies on the branding graph traversal

549
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,200
language that will allow you to you know

550
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,280
traverse the graph in the purest form

551
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,559
that you can think of um

552
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,799
of um

553
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,559
of an organization

554
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,880
one thing that um

555
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,520
we also looked at is the neo4j graph

556
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,640
database

557
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,120
uh it comes with a community edition and

558
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,039
you can actually use it and play with it

559
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,880
as the community edition

560
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
but you

561
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,360
you can also get you know a premium

562
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,799
license that gives you more

563
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,840
more things that you can you can use

564
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,760
also recently

565
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,880
aws offer offered a service which is

566
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,039
called um amazon web services neptune

567
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,240
it's a fast will reliable and managed

568
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
that's a very important thing it's a

569
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,360
fully managed graph database system

570
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,200
offered by aws as a service so you can

571
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,080
scale it up and down as you need it and

572
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,960
you can actually use it for your needs

573
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,200
you can actually put data in

574
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,600
inside that knowledge graph that you

575
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,080
create there based on the technology

576
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,919
and there are some products and i really

577
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,400
like a few uh public or open source

578
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,720
products one is cartography it's a

579
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,200
python based tool uh you know that you

580
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,799
can run against your cloud

581
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,840
infrastructure and it tries to map

582
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,679
the assets and create relationships

583
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,799
between them

584
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,679
um you know in a video visual form it's

585
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,840
powered by neo4j and you can actually go

586
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,880
to um to github and look at it

587
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,640
it's maintained by lyft

588
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,559
by left

589
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,720
the mobility company they created this

590
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,039
cartography because they use

591
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,960
this sort of technology in their

592
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,159
organization for mapping um for creating

593
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,520
routes in

594
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,960
in their solution you have open opencspm

595
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,520
which is a good solution

596
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,480
and

597
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,440
also

598
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,000
if you if you want to look at um there

599
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,799
are

600
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,280
recently this is pretty new the the

601
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,640
knowledge graph and the security

602
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,720
knowledge craft concepts are pretty new

603
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,960
in the cyber security industry they are

604
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,000
not new in the in the ikea world but we

605
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,679
can see recently more and more

606
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,559
applications in the cyber security uh

607
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,520
world

608
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,360
cyscale provides one of the security

609
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
knowledge graphs that you can use to you

610
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,159
know get a view into all your digital

611
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,240
organization because it connects to

612
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,720
cloud providers it connects to

613
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,919
sas providers it connects to identity

614
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,200
providers

615
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,960
and a lot of other things

616
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,039
so

617
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,640
that's about it

618
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
may the security knowledge craft protect

619
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,880
you that's something i like to tell

620
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,600
because you can actually do better with

621
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,840
your service security program if you

622
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,158
start thinking in the grass thank you
