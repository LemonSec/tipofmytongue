of this conversation today

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,840
for the introduction you can see this is

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,320
some information about me i'm so special

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,320
because when you google me i actually

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,559
have a little blurb that pops up which

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,519
is kind of interesting

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
there's a yeah so i run a company called

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,440

00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,640
instructor with fans as well i've been

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,239
there for about seven years

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,480
and of course i'm the president of the

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,760
denver awash chapter as i mentioned a

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,438
moment ago so lots of different things

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,920
i've done over the years

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,439
and i keep coming back to owasp i've

34
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,200
been doing owasp

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,000
for longer than all those things i've

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,920
been engaged with obas probably for over

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,360
a decade

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
as an attendee as someone who used to go

39
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
to the meetings and i still do go to

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,680
meetings now i run them i don't you know

41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,159
i don't just participate as an attendee

42
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,119
anymore

43
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,479
but i've been doing that for well over a

44
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,119
decade it feels like her around that

45
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,960
time and that's what i keep going back

46
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,680
to is community involvement it's giving

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,920
back it's having presentations it's

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
sharing knowledge and that's what it's

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,399
really all about for me and as time

50
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,840
progressed

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,600
i found myself becoming more more

52
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,079
involved with my local chapter

53
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,479
and at one point they were looking for

54
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,360
some help and i became a quote-unquote

55
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
board member

56
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,799
and from there

57
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,280
eventually became voted in as the

58
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,040
president and now

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,040
i have a lot more responsibility and the

60
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,799
same pay rate which is zero dollars

61
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,399
it's all volunteer

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,919
anyway what's this all about this is a

63
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,120
non-technical talk

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
okay no api so content security policies

65
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,200
no zero days

66
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,280
nothing like that this is all about

67
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
if you're interested in running a local

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,160
chapter of owasp and this could be as

69
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,720
you may know a wasp being a global

70
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,160
organization this could be anywhere any

71
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,040
country that you're in any city state

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,599
whatever the case may be territory

73
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,879
and

74
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,640
this is going to be quickly you know in

75
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,319
less than 30 minutes now talking about

76
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,319
how to go about doing it so these are

77
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,280
the basic topics we'll be discussing

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,400
and

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,920
i'll be happy to answer any questions

80
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,239
you have at the end of it

81
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,959
so what is your local chapter

82
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,480
well maybe you want to start one maybe

83
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,239
you already had one maybe the one you

84
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,040
have no one is going to maybe

85
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,319
covid

86
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,280
had a profound effect on your

87
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
attendees that show up

88
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,040
and you don't no longer really have a

89
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
chapter because no one shows up anymore

90
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,200
we rans that issue

91
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,040
when covet started we pivoted to

92
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,959
the virtual meetups

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,319
and that was fine it worked our

94
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,080
attendees slowly started going down at

95
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,040
our peak which was a couple years ago

96
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,799
we had

97
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,879
literally over 100

98
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,799
120 people

99
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,120
show up every month or every other month

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
when we did our regular meetup and

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
things were going very very well lots of

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,239
people

103
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,799
lots of engagement with the community

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,000
lots of great presentations lots of fun

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,879
i mean it was a really fun time and then

106
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,280
you know things changed uh and i'm gonna

107
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,720
talk about some things that are going to

108
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,080
change and some things you really need

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,159
to be focused in on uh to make your

110
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,040
local chapter what you want to be

111
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,920
and

112
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,400
as you can see here we still do meet ups

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,360
we're not

114
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,080
doing virtual anymore we did in person

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,680
for the first time

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,400
in close to two years

117
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,840
three days ago and we actually had

118
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
people show up

119
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,959
and this is the picture of the room at

120
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,959
the venue where we went to

121
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,320
and i want to highlight a couple things

122
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,040
here okay number one we have

123
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,800
happy people

124
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,440
that's a good important thing number two

125
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,800
if you look carefully there's a bottle

126
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,120
of alcohol there there's some alcohol

127
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,240
right there

128
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,919
and that's important because people like

129
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,919
to drink

130
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,479
and there's a projector up here

131
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,320
and there's a screen right here there's

132
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,199
some hdmi connection and there's as you

133
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,000
can see some silverware right here

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
and some soda

135
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,960
so food

136
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,360
drinks

137
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,560
av

138
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,440
which is in this case audio visual

139
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,680
people can see your presenter people can

140
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,919
hear your presenter people can drink

141
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,759
people can eat people can be relaxed

142
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,360
people can ask questions

143
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,160
that's what the meetup or the meeting

144
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,240
should really be all about that

145
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,400
engagement and that's what we got at

146
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,520
this venue and that's going to be an

147
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,720
important piece to this whole

148
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,560
conversation because that's what's going

149
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,759
to be one that

150
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,440
differentiating portions of what's going

151
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,039
to make you successful

152
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,880
or not so much

153
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,560
and i can tell you i've been to

154
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,759
wasp meetups across the country

155
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,440
and some of them have five people that

156
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,080
show up some of them have

157
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,759
10 people that show up

158
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,440
some of them

159
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,840
just go under the chapters fail they go

160
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
inactive

161
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,440
and they just they don't have longevity

162
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,080
and that's something that i want to

163
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,600
share with you as far as how to avoid

164
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,400
that if you have the desire to do so so

165
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,320
what does that actually mean well let's

166
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
have a chapter

167
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,479
as you can see here in the slide deck

168
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,800
i grabbed that straight from this url

169
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,720
the first half of this slide is just

170
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,759
copy and paste from owasp.org for slash

171
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,280
chapters this is what it's all about

172
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,560
having training

173
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,039
having talks and networking

174
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,560
that's really

175
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,240
what it comes down to there's not a

176
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,319
whole lot more

177
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,199
as far as my understanding is concerned

178
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
that the having a chapter is all about

179
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,560
really it's about

180
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
getting community involvement getting

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,479
engagement having people like-minded

182
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,800
people in the cyber security world come

183
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,280
together and you're thinking open

184
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,240
web application security project oh lost

185
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,639
and the a stands for application and the

186
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,720
w is for web you know web apps that

187
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
should be important but that's not what

188
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
it's all about we've had people do talks

189
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,039
on everything from wifi hacking to

190
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,199
hacking the human

191
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,160
to

192
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,560
completely managerial focused

193
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,800
content so it can be anything you want

194
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,280
as long as you're adding value i think

195
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,199
and providing that that space and that

196
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,360
place and that time for people to get

197
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,199
together and have discussion a frank

198
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,919
discussion about what's impacting their

199
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,160
lives and their jobs and their careers

200
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,919
and their cybersecurity choices are

201
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,880
going to help secure the world

202
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
one piece at a time i think that's

203
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
really what we're trying to go for here

204
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,880
and part of that is having the talks

205
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,479
part of that is having

206
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,800
actual training sessions where people

207
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,639
come in and learn how to do something

208
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,319
and some of that really a big piece of

209
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,960
that in my mind is networking

210
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,759
there's not one

211
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,319
event that's gone by as far as our

212
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,440
regular oas meetups where i can think of

213
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,080
anyway where we didn't have multiple job

214
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,520
openings where at the beginning of the

215
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,479
meetup

216
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,240
people stand up and say this is the name

217
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,840
of my company and these are the

218
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,520
positions that we are actively looking

219
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,240
for

220
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,120
because as many of you probably know

221
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,599
there is pretty much

222
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,720
zero

223
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,199
unemployment in the cyber security world

224
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,199
people are always looking for

225
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,000
for

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,840
failing positions so there's no shortage

227
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,080
of them out there and networking you

228
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,280
know this just helps make all this

229
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,039
better at the end of the day to fill

230
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,639
those positions and

231
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,080
do the enterprise

232
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,280
all right so my big thing here is

233
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,120
what's in it for the members or the

234
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
attendees who show up to meetings and

235
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,479
what are we doing to give back to the

236
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,639
community that's kind of the approach

237
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,879
i've taken over the years to to help

238
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,800
keep in mind when i'm thinking through

239
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,000
the purpose the mission the objectives

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,720
and

241
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,840
why i keep doing it for free

242
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,199
all right now people are the big piece

243
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,440
to this if you don't have people you

244
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,319
don't really have much of a chapter okay

245
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,919
it doesn't have to be

246
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,360
paid members if we quickly go back aside

247
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,440
you can see that anyone can attend

248
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,760
anyone can attend members and

249
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,679
non-members so people don't have to pay

250
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,919
to show up that's a core tenant i would

251
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,640
say within the owasp foundation not

252
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,880
required so getting people to show up is

253
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
probably the number one thing we want to

254
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
focus in on as far as building a chapter

255
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,320
and having longevity and driving people

256
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,040
to

257
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,800
to continue coming

258
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,720
so how do we do this

259
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
that's the number one question how do

260
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,279
people show up

261
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,800
i pointed out

262
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,640
the bottle of alcohol that someone's

263
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
drinking beer okay some people are

264
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
drinking liquor um you know that's not

265
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,000
the whole point this conversation i

266
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,080
don't want to dwell on that but i also

267
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,279
don't want to gloss over it okay people

268
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,120
some people enjoy that and other people

269
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
really like to eat food and some people

270
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,880
enjoy doing both and

271
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,120
giving away free food and free alcohol

272
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,000
is a

273
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,120
is a powerful kind of solution you have

274
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
to the number one issue here of getting

275
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,640
people to show up if you can be in a

276
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,839
position

277
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,680
where you can actually offer

278
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,519
those things to your attendees and

279
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,360
that's of course

280
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,600
not the main focus here and that's not

281
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
what really it's all about

282
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,440
but it does go a long way so i'm just

283
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,480
trying to be upfront with you and

284
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
straight up okay

285
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,360
if you can offer these things you're in

286
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
a better position now you

287
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
not you not out of your pocket not

288
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,720
spending money that's not what i'm

289
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,080
saying i'm talking about you and your

290
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,040
team

291
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
and i'll get more into that here in just

292
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,600
a moment

293
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
um

294
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,959
because ultimately someone is paying for

295
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,560
this i'll talk about sponsorship as well

296
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,320
the real thing here is like i said we're

297
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,000
trying to

298
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
share our knowledge

299
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
offer some networking opportunities

300
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,440
having training things like that so

301
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,040
getting people show up

302
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,959
those are the the selling points if you

303
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,040
will you come to this meeting you can

304
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,720
network with other people you can

305
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,760
advance your career you can

306
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
trade business cards you can do things

307
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,079
like that you can learn a new skill with

308
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,320
training you can sit and listen and

309
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,079
learn something that you didn't know

310
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,040
before

311
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,040
that you can then

312
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,000
take back to your place of business to

313
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,839
your day job

314
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,040
do something

315
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,839
with that

316
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,480
knowledge company better

317
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,720
that's a selling point that's going to

318
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,760
help get people motivated to get up

319
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,160
and go to your meetings

320
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,440
and

321
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,920
hopefully show back up the next month

322
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,959
and the month after that

323
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,480
it's not just you it's a team effort so

324
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,160
we actually have to be thinking through

325
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,120
what does a team look like

326
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,040
at the

327
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,839
at my denver oahs chapter uh here in

328
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,519
colorado united states

329
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,160
we we call each other board members like

330
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,040
board of directors kind of

331
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
and these board members i think it's

332
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
just a fancy term for basically

333
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,760
volunteers and we all try to do

334
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,040
different things so i have a couple

335
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,640
people dedicated to

336
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,839
to vetting

337
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,320
our speakers and our slash presenters

338
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,440
whoever it is that's going to be doing

339
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,640
the talk

340
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,160
we have people who are dedicated to

341
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,959
trying to find sponsors we have people

342
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,480
that are

343
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,279
dedicated to checking for venues and our

344
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,560
new venue and trying to get a better

345
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,240
price or trying to understand if we're

346
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
we're in a good situation in the venue

347
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
with the venue we're currently at

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,160
and it's a hodgepodge this is all

349
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,959
volunteer work so none of us get paid

350
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,680
for any of this and there's six of us

351
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,440
plus a couple other folks

352
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,680
because a lot of us we just don't have

353
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,000
time to dedicate to this like a

354
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,680
full-time job or even a part-time job

355
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,880
this is just

356
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
a few extra hours here and there which

357
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
is why you know it takes so many of us

358
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,360
to

359
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,680
accomplish what we accomplish

360
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,639
i'm not saying we accomplish a lot

361
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,880
but finding speakers is a big thing

362
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,959
you think that well maybe i'm not gonna

363
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,800
guess what you're thinking but we have a

364
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,720
link on our website

365
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,440
where people can submit presentations

366
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,040
24 hours a day

367
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,839
and i think we've gotten like one or two

368
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,480
of those in like the last five years

369
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
literally

370
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,959
literally no one uses that link to

371
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,480
submit their talk

372
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,320
i don't know why maybe we don't

373
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,000
advertise it well enough

374
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,160
or something along those lines

375
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,040
but finding someone to present

376
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,880
is a challenge

377
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,040
finding one person that's not that hard

378
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,920
finding two people okay that's doable

379
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,320
if you have six meetups per year that's

380
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,720
one every other month

381
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,000
you might be able to do that for a year

382
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,760
but how about if you're doing this for

383
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,120
like five years in a row or you're

384
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,200
thinking long term you got to find a

385
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,279
process that works for you to find the

386
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,720
speakers

387
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,200
okay and the other thing is you can't

388
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,959
like i say you can't i'm going to say

389
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,200
it's important to get people who are

390
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,639
well

391
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,880
or good who are solid who are high

392
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,839
quality

393
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,160
if you just accept anybody

394
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
you get a potentially a low quality

395
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,720
presentation

396
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,320
i want to sit there

397
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,720
and listen

398
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,560
he decides

399
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,920
as

400
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,680
a very boring voice

401
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,639
who

402
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,959
talks too quietly and

403
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,320
puts

404
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
and has no enthusiasm or do you want

405
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,079
someone who can actually present and

406
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,320
have the slides come alive and share

407
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,519
knowledge that someone didn't know and

408
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,680
people enthusiastic about it that's the

409
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,800
difference

410
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,320
people don't show up over and over if

411
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,240
you have boring presenters or people who

412
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,120
don't

413
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,839
publicly speak very well okay so you

414
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,839
gotta vet that presentation

415
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,360
and the presenter so

416
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,639
that's presentation what does that mean

417
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,720
it means

418
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,079
we can't have

419
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,600
someone in here just trying to sell a

420
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,800
product

421
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,079
and i said a big piece of this and

422
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,279
that's a very

423
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,199
big red flag for owasp and that's a red

424
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,800
flag for your chapter as well when you

425
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,680
have attendees

426
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,279
you when you have attendees that

427
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,560
uh feel like they're being sold

428
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,959
something

429
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,000
they don't show back up too often and

430
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,440
just a heads up

431
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,959
if you're on the psych channel i am

432
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,160
paying attention to that so you have any

433
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,600
questions along the way i'll be happy to

434
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,160
answer those

435
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
and i appreciate that andre

436
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,600
by the way

437
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,560
um so yeah the sponsors is a big thing

438
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
as well you have to find someone who's

439
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,920
gonna give you money because like i said

440
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,040
you're not paying for this out of your

441
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,399
own pocket and food and alcohol and the

442
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,839
venue itself

443
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,639
we're a couple thousand dollars in every

444
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,040
single time we do a meet up

445
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,680
two to three thousand dollars depending

446
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,440
how many people show up you know but

447
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,800
generally that's

448
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,120
that's about what it is at the nice

449
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,360
venue that we like because we've been

450
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
other venues where the audio and video

451
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,920
they have like one tv and it's small or

452
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,680
they have no microphone or they have

453
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
these speakers that don't work very well

454
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
or there's a bar next door that's too

455
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,360
loud okay those are all issues you have

456
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,959
to you have to think through so that

457
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,720
your team is gonna be comprised of

458
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,920
people who can actually help you with

459
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,040
some of the stuff

460
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,519
okay that's what we're talking about

461
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,600
now like i said the speakers is the

462
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,040
person we had

463
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,079
last

464
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,279
tuesday

465
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,320
dan ward he came in along with greg foss

466
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,920
two pretty big names out here or

467
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,440
probably in the industry in general you

468
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,959
can google them and people

469
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,560
you'll see what i'm talking about

470
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,920
even little things like if you look

471
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,839
carefully that's the name of this dude's

472
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,240
company right up there

473
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,800
you didn't vet that well enough you know

474
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,079
you talk about your company once the

475
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,920
opening slide that's cool but like i

476
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,839
said if you're to sit here and your

477
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,560
whole talk is about how your tool can

478
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,000
save the day

479
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,440
people

480
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
know they're being sold something and we

481
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,880
have to try to avoid that as much as

482
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,040
possible if we want to have a quality

483
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,320
presentation so keep that in mind

484
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,560
no vendor pitches number one

485
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,240
now you may be in a situation where you

486
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,839
start talking to vendors

487
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,480
or sponsors which may be the same thing

488
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,959
and you say hey i saw you at the uh the

489
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,959
rsa conference or at the the olas

490
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,320
conference and i saw that you sponsored

491
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,639
olas would you like to sponsor this

492
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,240
local chapter

493
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,519
they say

494
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,279
what's in it for us

495
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,759
we're not gonna give you money for free

496
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,000
yeah you're a 51c3 and it's a tax

497
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,240
write-off but no no no how about how

498
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,079
about we'll pay you the money you need

499
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,560
to sponsor the event and

500
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,518
you let us present

501
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,800
yeah not so much that's what we call i

502
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,560
believe pay to play is the terminology

503
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,480
we use there and if the sponsor only

504
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,559
wants to pay if they can send a person

505
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,880
of theirs to present you gotta be very

506
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,160
careful with that

507
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,959
very careful okay otherwise you're gonna

508
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,599
sour your attendees very quickly and

509
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,599
poison the whole chapter because now

510
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,359
it's like everyone just wants to pay

511
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,439
money so they can go pitch their product

512
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,520
to your people and become a conduit

513
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,640
that's not what we're trying to

514
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,679
accomplish

515
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,760
so be very careful with that the other

516
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,599
thing here of course

517
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,440
like i said about vetting the person how

518
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,120
good are they what they do

519
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,799
are they doing public speaking regularly

520
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,039
how often are they doing it

521
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,320
their presentation any good

522
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,039
lots of things like this come into play

523
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,080
so

524
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,400
you may be in a position where you need

525
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,360
to turn down potential candidates

526
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,000
for speakers because

527
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
it's a risk it's a gamble if you have

528
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,480
someone come in there who's never

529
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,039
presented before

530
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,880
that's iffy you don't know what you're

531
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,120
going get it's it's a gamble that's what

532
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
i mean by that and

533
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,039
you know there's two sides to that coin

534
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,559
you give someone a chance give them an

535
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,880
opportunity it's a local chapter

536
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,760
it's an interesting topic why not

537
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,679
that's something that i don't disagree

538
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,919
with it's just being careful because if

539
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,000
they're not very good at what they do

540
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,720
as far as presenting the topic in a in a

541
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,559
meaningful way that resonates with

542
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,919
people

543
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,440
then you may end up with a situation

544
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,240
where

545
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
you're alienating some of the the folks

546
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,440
who showed up

547
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,480
so it's it's a balancing act

548
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,679
okay it's a balancing act but definitely

549
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,280
bet the speaker to the best of your

550
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,919
ability assuming you have

551
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,039
choices of who's going to speak

552
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,640
the other thing here of course is what

553
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,200
do we actually do well we meet up and

554
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,760
there's a whole website called

555
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,039
meetupmeetup.com i think is what it is

556
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,919
and this is what the owasp foundation

557
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,760
has chosen for us to use as a platform

558
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,559
to

559
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,080
keep track of

560
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,480
registered attendees and share the

561
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,200
details of the actual meetup meaning

562
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,559
this will be

563
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,720
the website people go to to say yes i'm

564
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,799
going to show up and get information

565
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,280
about where the location is what time it

566
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,400
starts who the speaker is what the topic

567
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,480
is things like that so meetup.com is

568
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
where we host all that stuff and this is

569
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,160
where the attendees will go to obtain

570
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,679
the information and there's even a

571
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,480
little bit of

572
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,320
messaging built into that that website

573
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,559
as well not that it's used too much but

574
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,600
that's what we're talking about so

575
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,000
meetup this is typically

576
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
every other month

577
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,080
depending on your chapter there is a

578
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,320
point in time where denver owes chapter

579
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,799
we were aiming to do this

580
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,880
once a month

581
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,640
we were when we were riding high and we

582
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,280
had 120 140 people showing up every

583
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,120
month and we were knocked out of the

584
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
park figuratively speaking we were going

585
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,400
for like let's do this every month this

586
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,600
is awesome

587
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,240
this is a lot of fun and a lot of great

588
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,440
involvement

589
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,520
and a lot of good food and a lot of good

590
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,400
people

591
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
you know because that's that counts

592
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,280
and then

593
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,360
things change you know global pandemic

594
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,000
hits and now we're doing virtual meetups

595
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,679
and now we're doing every other month

596
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,760
when we can okay so i think there is a

597
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,480
a mandate from oh the foundation itself

598
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,679
that says if you want to be a quote

599
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,480
unquote active chapter then you need to

600
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,520
do at least every other month meetups

601
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,240
which is where part of the

602
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,559
the push for

603
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,080
getting

604
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,320
all of your components lined up really

605
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,480
comes from as in your speakers your

606
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,400
venue your sponsors

607
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,159
okay it's like i said doing it once

608
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,679
isn't that big of a deal you can make

609
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,400
that happen probably by yourself

610
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,720
sustaining that over time is challenging

611
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,559
okay and that's part of partially why

612
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,919
i'm doing this talk to help share some

613
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,760
information that i have to maybe make

614
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,280
your life a little bit easier should you

615
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,799
choose to embark

616
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,559
down this path

617
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,720
so what happens uh as you saw from that

618
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,320
meetup the uh the picture i showed a

619
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,440
moment ago

620
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,760
people come in they sit down they

621
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,360
hopefully have some food have something

622
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,240
to drink

623
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,760
and sit back relax and have a

624
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,080
presentation we go through announcements

625
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,640
we have opening slide deck that myself

626
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,880
and my fellow board members will will

627
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,039
talk about any upcoming events any

628
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,640
upcoming

629
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,240
things that are of relevance to the

630
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,559
community and general

631
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,320
chapter announcements

632
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
for instance we announced that

633
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,039
we're planning to do our regular

634
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,760
annual conference next year for example

635
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,200
and then the other big thing of course

636
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,159
is you know keeping people entertained

637
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,480
and we were doing trivia we did some

638
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,760
kahoot stuff

639
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,919
we had some rivalries between various

640
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,679
attendees in a playful fun way

641
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,400
but yeah we used to give out gift cards

642
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,080
um there was a period time we did it for

643
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
many many meetups in a row where we

644
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,159
start with trivia like a jeopardy style

645
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,240
answer the questions get people like an

646
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,480
ice breaker if you will but you know put

647
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,159
some skin in the game where the winning

648
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,360
team would get a

649
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,480
everyone on the team would get a gift

650
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,159
card to starbucks or something simple

651
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,240
like that which of course is more money

652
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,080
to be very straightforward with you

653
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,200
which is more

654
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,080
of an ask from the sponsor like do you

655
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,440
want to sponsor this and buy some gift

656
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,039
cards too

657
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,240
so there's

658
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,640
yeah it's not cheap and not free

659
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,600
now the venue of course is the big big

660
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,000
thing here okay this is probably in my

661
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,320
opinion which is why i have it in red

662
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,240
one of the more difficult things to

663
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,919
obtain

664
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,360
and

665
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,360
be satisfied with

666
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,440
okay you see a microphone you see the

667
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,960
video that's the av seth i'm talking

668
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,159
about

669
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,039
does

670
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,600
the venue have this

671
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
for you does it work

672
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,679
just two days ago

673
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,840
we ran into an issue with microphones

674
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,760
okay one of them worked just fine

675
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,400
but one of them isn't enough why not why

676
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,520
isn't one microphone enough there's only

677
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,480
one person resenting right yes there is

678
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,760
but then the audience asks questions

679
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
so myself and my team will walk around

680
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,760
the room and hand the microphone to an

681
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,159
audience member so everyone can hear

682
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,280
them

683
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,440
okay it's not a problem until you

684
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,360
identify it as a problem like if it's a

685
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,120
small room with 10 people that's not an

686
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,039
issue you saw the size of the room we're

687
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,120
in that holds over 100 people

688
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,480
and it's big

689
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,159
i guess is the way to say it and not

690
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,440
everyone in the back can hear everybody

691
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,360
in the front so we have microphones and

692
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,520
we have multiple microphones so people

693
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,919
the audience can be just as well heard

694
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,320
as presenter it makes it a better

695
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,480
experience if you will if you don't have

696
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
that that could be an issue

697
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,960
projector we had a place where it had a

698
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,679
shoddy projector or the example i gave a

699
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,120
small tv or

700
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,600
just issues like that hdmi or lack of

701
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,240
hdmi someone had like a vga hookup

702
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,200
just this tv they wheeled in it looked

703
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,960
like it was 20 years old

704
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,400
it's like what's going on here with this

705
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,760
thing

706
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,919
so venue venue is real and these

707
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,279
concerns are real

708
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,360
food and drinks that's also a big

709
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,240
concern if your venue

710
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,880
doesn't allow outside food or drinks

711
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,440
that that's not going to be

712
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,360
good for you unless of course they

713
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
provide the food and drinks themselves

714
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,559
all right but

715
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,000
there's extra money associated with this

716
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,840
type of stuff so you have to keep that

717
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,600
in mind ideally you're going to want to

718
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,480
have

719
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,679
all these things you see here in the

720
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,679
bullet points the the food

721
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,159
good food ideally if you can get quality

722
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,200
food

723
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,600
and the regularity so you can keep the

724
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,279
third wednesday of every month that's

725
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,760
the that's the owasp meeting day the

726
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,360
third or whatever you choose for your

727
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
chapter of course i'm just highlighting

728
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,200
the need for consistency

729
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,559
and also

730
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,880
this you know location location location

731
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,640
you live in a big city

732
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,440
driving to this one centralized location

733
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,360
is super convenient for

734
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,720
half the people

735
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
the other half of people hate driving

736
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,520
into the city because there's so much

737
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,279
traffic and they can you know they can

738
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,960
complain about it or

739
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,720
you know it's just it is what it is so

740
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,840
you gotta keep those things in mind when

741
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,200
you try to find a location and then

742
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,000
switching location from month to month

743
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,120
can also

744
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,400
be an issue you know keeping that

745
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,080
consistency

746
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,120
of course you'll be working with the

747
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,799
oauth foundation as well you're going to

748
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,520
be creating money hopefully and

749
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,600
maybe spending some money as well

750
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,080
and i think all spending is on hold last

751
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,640
i read so the big thing here is if you

752
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,919
can

753
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,080
generate income and revenue for the

754
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,760
foundation itself you're in a much

755
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,000
better position okay this is 51c3

756
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,600
nonprofit organization here is what we

757
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,120
call in the us

758
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,799
which is where it's you know founded

759
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,559
incorporated or whatever the terminology

760
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,440
is

761
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,480
and

762
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,880
what we've typically done my denver oash

763
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,120
chapter that is what we'll do

764
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,279
is have the sponsors pay for everything

765
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,559
there was a point in time where we were

766
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,640
asking for some reimbursement because we

767
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,320
had a budget uh it actually was uh

768
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,720
it took some effort to go that route so

769
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,159
it's

770
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,320
been found to be easier just to have

771
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,240
sponsor pay for everything and not worry

772
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,120
about

773
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,400
involving the foundation to ask for

774
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,159
money

775
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,679
be that

776
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,960
as it may

777
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,760
we do as i alluded to before try to run

778
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,320
an annual larger conference where we

779
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,880
have many many vendors who come in and

780
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,799
lots and lots of revenue from ticket

781
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,400
sales and from vendors

782
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,960
uh or specifically sponsors i should say

783
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,799
where we'll give those proceeds to the

784
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,200
oas foundation itself to keep things

785
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,880
moving and keep people paid and things

786
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,279
like that but you will be going working

787
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,279
hand in hand with the foundation itself

788
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,600
to do things like sign contracts to help

789
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,840
you get sponsors and things like that

790
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,520
and that's really what the objective

791
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,400
here is

792
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,039
now with the funding

793
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,200
yeah if you don't have

794
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,960
food you don't have drinks you don't

795
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,200
have a venue you don't have meetups you

796
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
don't have a chapter that's it

797
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,000
you need money to do this

798
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,360
in most cases you got to get that

799
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,799
sponsorship you can probably get a

800
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,120
couple things for free here and there

801
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,640
not everything

802
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,440
so i've already talked about this

803
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,240
to the extent i'm going to

804
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,919
the other big thing here is our audience

805
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,440
and the outreach

806
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,120
you don't need to talk about the obama

807
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,559
top 10 every month

808
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,720
you can keep it light informal you can

809
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,840
talk about whatever you want to talk

810
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,520
about just make sure you're giving

811
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,440
people what they need to keep coming

812
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,200
back once you have the sponsors once you

813
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,400
have the speakers once you have the

814
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,240
venue once you've

815
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,880
cleared all the logistical hurdles now

816
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,120
it's time to get down to the quality

817
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,720
making sure people are getting what they

818
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,039
need what they want you're listening to

819
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,399
the feedback

820
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,039
and you're providing that to your

821
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,440
audience

822
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,880
the last thing here is of course if

823
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,320
you're not having fun

824
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,480
you're not doing it right

825
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,279
uh

826
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,480
and of course you're not getting paid

827
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,840
for any of this that's not how it works

828
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,080
it's all volunteer work for a non-profit

829
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,840
organization

830
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,399
uh it's just not a lot of work i highly

831
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,919
suggest getting a team to help you with

832
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:50,880
this

833
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,000
and

834
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,760
the other thing here of course is you

835
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,840
know we still are in a pandemic so you

836
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,480
gotta plan accordingly other than that

837
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,480
i'm here to help answer questions i'll

838
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
