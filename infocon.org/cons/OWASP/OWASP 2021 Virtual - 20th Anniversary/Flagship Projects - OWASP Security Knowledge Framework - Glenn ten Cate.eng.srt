[Music]

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,240
all right everybody thank you for uh

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,719
being here with me at this uh great

4

event the 20th anniversary of all of us

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,960
very great and awesome

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,600
uh well my name is glen tankata i'm the

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,119
author of the security knowledge

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,359
framework um together with my brother

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,519
ricardo tankata like i said

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,240
unfortunately he couldn't be here but uh

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,359
yeah he is in uh getting a bit better so

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,600
it would be fine i have a guest speaker

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
over here uh vulcan

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,520
he will also introduce himself but you

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,160
know in a nutshell i'm doing practical

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,719
security more than 15 years now

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,600
um seeing a lot of you know gaps and

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,920
issues and uh you know seven years ago

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,239
when i started the project the security

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,520
knowledge framework together with my

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,399
brother

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,719
um yeah we really wanted to to help and

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,800
improve the world then we came in

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,280
contact with all wasp through jim meniko

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,840
he was a lost board member at the time

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,000
and yeah it was such an amazing

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,880
community good vibe same vision same

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
mission they we said hey we're gonna

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,600
join this family as well uh what's been

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,799
uh yeah

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,560
put the security knowledge framework

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,040
there as well and uh well now seven

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,759
years later we made a lot of cool stuff

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,320
uh like you mentioned security by design

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,880
training developers um so that's what

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,360
we're gonna show and demo today actually

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
um so yeah that is me in a nutshell then

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
i would say vulcan all right so my name

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,600
is volcan welcome

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,680
and i am working as a penetration tester

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,520
at the ing belgium

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,600
uh yeah it's such a great honor to be

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,079
here with you guys and to participate is

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,399
such a great all ups project

45
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,200
yeah

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,960
thank you very much

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,360
um yeah and like we mentioned

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,119
in the beginning right it's all about

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,600
training and you know writing secure

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,119
code by design and um we started you

51
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,960
know back in the day seven years ago

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,200
with a very simple approach using the

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,520
application security verification

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,200
standard so if you didn't visit that uh

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,720
you know recording yet i would

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,878
definitely enroll for that one as well

57
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,480
we also have a couple of other

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
suggestions it's hard to pick because

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,640
yeah they're all very awesome right to

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,480
see and uh to witness

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,120
um but you know the the whole concept of

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,760
skf how it started like seven years ago

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,640
was really enabling developers yeah from

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,720
the start to do proper security by

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,040
design and at that time i was challenged

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,959
by the company saying hey glenn you're a

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,800
security engineer

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,519
we're gonna release 20 or 30 times a day

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,840
yeah how do we tackle security right

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,360
well then of course you have all the

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,599
security tooling and automation and that

72
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,440
definitely helps and you know you should

73
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,239
have those quality gates in your cicd

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,040
pipeline but still 20 times a day that's

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,160
a lot right so here we need awareness

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,879
training education you know to even

77
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,239
prevent all those type of

78
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,480
vulnerabilities getting into the cicd

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,959
pipeline so here the whole concept and

80
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,319
idea of skf and one knowledge center of

81
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,519
security

82
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,440
was basically born right

83
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,480
um

84
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,000
and again if we look a bit at the

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
features of skf right

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,800
we have multiple features that enables

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
and helps developers and doing security

88
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,080
by design so you can store your projects

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,959
in there um and using these projects you

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,760
can then also get like design patterns

91
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,000
uh there's an expert wizard in it as

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,799
well so based on the asvs or your

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,360
adaptation of the asvs you basically get

94
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,000
a questionnaire an expert wizard where

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,239
based on the questions it will select

96
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,720
from the 300 requirements from the asvs

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,959
the right set of security requirements

98
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,959
for your feature that you're developing

99
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:49,760
right

100
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,959
um also we have extensive code examples

101
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,200
in like different languages like php

102
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,840
java.net uh

103
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,280
python um like the 40 45 most common uh

104
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,120
yeah code snippets or features that you

105
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,959
would build in an application or need

106
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,879
right like session management or file

107
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,120
uploading and here the goal was really

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,519
not only have like a a high level

109
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,399
overview and explanation using the asvs

110
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,798
or the knowledge base items that we have

111
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,880
but also really go on a detailed level

112
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,360
to guide the developer step by step why

113
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,440
we are doing certain things in the code

114
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,880
right

115
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,800
another important thing is also we have

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,680
the checklist feature as well so in here

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,080
you can find back the asvs and the masvs

118
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,400
so this is great as a reference

119
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,160
material where you can easily in an

120
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,520
application right in skf look it up

121
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,400
most importantly also we have labs so

122
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,120
that means we have like around 70 plus

123
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,080
now labs from skf itself

124
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
but we also have for example jew shop

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,479
integrated into it so you can also start

126
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,080
to do shop uh cool hacking activities

127
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,520
and labs directly from skf

128
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,400
i meant

129
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
mentioned already like the knowledge

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
base section so here we have the

131
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
our own created knowledge base items to

132
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,600
give more deeper understanding of like

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,720
requirements or certain idea argon uh

134
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,800
you know that you get that more

135
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,520
understanding of certain concepts or

136
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,840
vulnerabilities

137
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,520
right uh yeah user management support um

138
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
speaks for itself also maybe good to

139
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,840
mention i didn't put it on the slide

140
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,160
but actually we also have a chat bot

141
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
that you can deploy in like slack getter

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,840
it supports like 30 different uh chat

143
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,120
adapters

144
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,680
where you can deploy this chat bot and

145
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,240
actually it uses the knowledge base data

146
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,639
from skf the checklist

147
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,039
all that good stuff and you can query it

148
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,199
using this machine learning chatbot so

149
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,280
that's pretty cool that you can just

150
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,759
integrate it into your you know chat of

151
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,160
like microsoft slack whatever and if you

152
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,560
have a question like uh it knows a

153
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
couple of intents like hey explain me

154
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,919
this or how to solve this or what does

155
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,840
this mean and again with machine

156
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,240
learning it's then correlating items to

157
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,639
the knowledge base item to the checklist

158
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,960
or even getting code examples so you can

159
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,400
ask it like hey i'm building a i need a

160
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,160
php input validation then boom the chat

161
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
bot will give you the code snippet from

162
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,600
skf for input validation so very nifty

163
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,440
that means you don't have to really jump

164
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
into the application itself right you

165
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,759
can just straight away ask the chatbot

166
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,840
and uh you get your feedback so that's

167
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,240
also pretty awesome

168
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,680
um yeah then you know how does skf fit

169
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,080
in your secure development lifecycle

170
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,560
well normally i would say it all starts

171
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,479
you know when we're talking about doing

172
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,039
proper security by design it all starts

173
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,759
with having the right requirements right

174
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,800
and for this you use the asvs the masvs

175
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,880
because those are really awesome os

176
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,599
projects right that already took care of

177
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,400
all the combinational requirements

178
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
and the good thing about skf you can

179
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,800
fine-tune those requirements as well

180
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,120
right it's key important

181
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,680
when you want to implement an asvs or an

182
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,560
masvs that you are able to modify the

183
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,199
requirements to the needs and the fit of

184
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,440
your organization how you develop and

185
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,199
which type of technology stacks you're

186
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,680
using right so with skf you have that

187
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,840
possibility as well well and then of

188
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,240
course the design phase where you can

189
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
yeah really filter like

190
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,800
using the expert system which type of

191
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,440
requirements do you need right and then

192
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,080
also like what is the mitigation so

193
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
normally in the requirement itself it

194
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
gives a good clue and a good

195
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,479
understanding already like how to then

196
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,879
tackle this requirement but what we did

197
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,520
in skx we added knowledge base items to

198
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
all the requirements again to do that

199
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,879
deep dive and explain even on other you

200
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,759
know

201
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,840
different uh

202
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
approaches what you as a developer

203
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,599
should do

204
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,039
then of course you go

205
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,879
have all these requirements you did your

206
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,400
design

207
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,080
you have the security requirements from

208
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,479
skf well now is the part for the coding

209
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,479
right and here again

210
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,599
uh we have coding snippets to even guide

211
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,039
the developer in some of the

212
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,840
requirements on how to implement them

213
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,120
and what we also did is for a lot of the

214
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,039
the requirements we added also the

215
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,200
testing phases so which type of

216
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,839
requirements could you maybe automate

217
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,000
using other os testing

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,360
tools right so

219
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,958
take for example

220
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,399
a what's up

221
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,240
some of the requirements you can really

222
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,640
test well with the other os projects is

223
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,959
up to do dynamic testing of those

224
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,680
requirements right for other tools

225
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,839
for other requirements maybe we want to

226
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,720
use the os dependency checker right to

227
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,399
check for known vulnerabilities in

228
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,160
components and libraries and all that

229
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,200
good stuff

230
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,240
so here we also try to see and really

231
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,399
guide again also on the testing point of

232
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,560
view like hey yes this requirement is

233
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,480
coming back all the time but

234
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,160
if you would use this tool you can

235
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,760
automate it and then you don't have to

236
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,360
worry about this one

237
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,760
well and also like it says you know from

238
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,600
that from that whole flow we go into the

239
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,040
metrics right you get all this

240
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
information back these requirements you

241
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,279
can follow them up you can mark them

242
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,279
there's a whole audit flow as well in

243
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,200
skf

244
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,279
then when you did everything you get

245
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,440
like results back you know from a pen

246
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
test or stuff like that you could also

247
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,839
act on it and say hey we see a lot of

248
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,440
these type of vulnerabilities coming

249
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,240
back

250
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,120
let's use the lab section in skf to

251
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,440
train the developers right in those

252
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,839
specific vulnerabilities that always pop

253
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,240
up and give them the opportunity to

254
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,440
really understand and train and and play

255
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,279
with this type of vulnerability in a

256
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,200
safe you know environment where it is

257
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,640
allowed

258
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,480
um yeah and again

259
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,279
culture by building and binding

260
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,519
you know if you use skf and you use it

261
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,200
as a training as your security

262
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,079
requirements you create maybe a security

263
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,200
maturity

264
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,959
program around it with security

265
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,720
champions you really you know are

266
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,839
getting that

267
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,800
security dna into the company right

268
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,360
um so the whole package we really wanted

269
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,079
to to think okay how can we help

270
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,720
organizations but developers yeah and

271
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,399
give them all the right tools and

272
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,040
information and awareness to do security

273
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,480
proper by design okay so that was really

274
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,800
our goal over here

275
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,839
um yeah and just to mention uh you know

276
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,880
we have many projects at olas uh you

277
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,040
know all of them we love right

278
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,600
but a couple uh we integrated and you

279
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,760
are using also in the security knowledge

280
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,839
framework so like i said the almost

281
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,839
cheat sheet project but a lot of

282
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,839
knowledge based items that we created we

283
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,120
are also referencing and making a link

284
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
to the cheat sheet project that's out

285
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,440
there very awesome project also gives

286
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,720
you tons of information and guidance on

287
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,279
certain topics and areas right like olaf

288
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,279
or jwt or just input validation great

289
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,320
project and we also have it integrated

290
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
sort of in the security knowledge

291
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,959
framework

292
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,600
i already mentioned it the asps amazing

293
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,839
project the application security

294
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,399
verification standard for all your

295
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,959
security requirements and another great

296
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,360
os project that we integrated is the jew

297
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,640
shop so this is again a very

298
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,240
extensive

299
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,399
application where you can really learn

300
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,399
and and you know again in a safe

301
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,640
environment practice your your security

302
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,680
skills in like finding them you know

303
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,480
they're even also secure coding fixes

304
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,320
that you can do in the juice shop so

305
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,160
again all these projects

306
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,639
we're using them and we love them and we

307
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,800
have integrated them into the security

308
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,200
knowledge framework

309
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,800
um well now it's up to you for my turn

310
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,079
yes uh well before i start talking about

311
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,639
the mobile skf stuff but we i would like

312
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,880
to mention those projects they are such

313
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,279
a great project for mobile security and

314
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,519
they will have a couple sessions also

315
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,839
here for today and i really recommend

316
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,800
their session for if you are as security

317
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,399
mobile security guy or if you are

318
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,399
interested in mobile security

319
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,279
uh in a nutshell msus is a kind of like

320
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,000
giving overview about the security items

321
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and you will know where to start how to

322
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,040
start and mstg is a little more

323
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
practical way to hack

324
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,360
it shows like both theoretical and

325
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,800
practical way with source code examples

326
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,120
and how to exploit it in real world

327
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
examples so it's like a more

328
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
comprehensive if you compare it with the

329
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,720
msvs but we took those projects together

330
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,360
to build something related with mobile

331
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,920
skf because like as glam mentioned like

332
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,360
uh scf has a lot of features to develop

333
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
to create a better development

334
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,000
environment and it gives ideas about how

335
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,760
to hack them how to defense them in a

336
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,600
boat way so what we have done uh we took

337
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,000
those great projects to

338
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,560
into consideration and we implemented it

339
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,760
with a mobile sql it's a new section for

340
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,720
skf and it will cover mobile related

341
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,000
security stuff and examples so they are

342
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,160
great projects and we decided to

343
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
implement it in our

344
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,839
as i mentioned like the project and we

345
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,560
did some customizations we added some

346
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,760
extra contents and we also create a new

347
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,000
question set which is like maybe a

348
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,800
little bit unique to skf because uh when

349
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,360
you look at those documents like there

350
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,839
are maybe like a hundred around 100

351
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,160
items you need to handle with them but

352
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,320
with those questions that you just like

353
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,560
to you will know what to focus on and

354
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
the question like after answering your

355
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,480
questions and it will give you idea

356
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,800
which section you should focus on and

357
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,880
maybe many issues will be like let's say

358
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,279
filter out and you will spend time on

359
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,040
the issues you need to

360
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,480
so that's why it's a very good approach

361
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
and as i mentioned like it has some a

362
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,839
lot of content to also give ideas

363
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,160
developers and also the attackers how to

364
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,880
test how to check and maybe like they're

365
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,639
not right now but in the future we will

366
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,800
also thinking to implement some like

367
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,240
code examples in a practical way to uh

368
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,519
to educate more people yes so thank you

369
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,680
very much i'm very happy with the work

370
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,160
vulcan has put in i mean it was a lot of

371
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,880
work it's uh an amazing contribution so

372
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,199
thank you very much it's my pleasure um

373
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,959
and yeah that that is also a bit you

374
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,519
know what i wanted to demo uh very

375
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,560
quickly in skf that yes we have a lot of

376
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,120
content now in it right we have the asvs

377
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,639
we have the knowledge base items for

378
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,760
asus we have mobile so the masves now

379
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,000
with all the knowledge base items you

380
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
can both use the asps and the m asps now

381
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,839
in the expert wizard for when you're

382
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,360
managing your project and you want

383
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,440
security requirements before you start

384
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,839
programming right so you are aware of

385
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,000
what the features are from a security

386
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,680
requirement point of view

387
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,639
um but the good thing is about skf is it

388
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,440
is built in such a way that you can just

389
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
do it you know and add your own

390
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,760
checklist as well so that is the the

391
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,160
awesomeness of skf

392
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,040
um so here we have the demo environment

393
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
this is by the way running on my

394
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,360
raspberry pi kubernetes cluster at home

395
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,639
um so it could be that it is maybe a bit

396
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,120
slow sometimes but then you know why

397
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
because it's running on a couple of

398
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,320
raspberry pi's

399
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,639
uh but nevertheless so here we have the

400
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,759
latest version of skf the landing page

401
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,839
if white is too uh too painful for the

402
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,839
eyes you have the dark mode and as you

403
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,680
can see we have a lot of references to

404
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,160
asgs msvs cheat sheets and also another

405
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,560
awesome thing to check out is the open

406
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,880
ssf tedx course

407
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,279
um so all the things i just mentioned

408
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,040
you know about the code examples the

409
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,360
checklist they're all in here

410
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,440
for you to see so here we have the web

411
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,480
application basically the asvs

412
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
here we can click them and here you have

413
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
all the requirements the security

414
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,040
requirements from the asvs

415
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,160
and as you see there are quite many um

416
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,240
so this is really i would say a nice

417
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,959
reference where you can see and also

418
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,800
read more where we have the description

419
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,279
of that requirement and also what the

420
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,519
mitigation would be right when you are

421
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,839
developing like what are the steps or to

422
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,560
give you more guidance on implementing a

423
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,480
requirement like this

424
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,040
so we have the checklist and like i said

425
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,120
the work that the vulcan has been doing

426
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,079
we now also have mobile the mas masves

427
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,639
and here again we have all the knowledge

428
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,399
based items and the requirements in

429
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,360
there

430
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,480
now

431
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,800
the other thing is knowledge base so for

432
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,279
knowledge base we have like i mentioned

433
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,160
a lot of like in-depth explanation so

434
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,640
this one you can or search right in the

435
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,439
application of skf yourself and get more

436
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,079
understanding or ideally you could also

437
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,039
deploy a chatbot of skf and then ask hey

438
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,599
what is a missing custom error page or

439
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,000
what is what are error pages then it

440
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,119
would link the the machine learning code

441
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,679
for example to this knowledge base item

442
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,919
and then give like the description part

443
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,000
if you would ask hey how do i fix or

444
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,640
solve error page issues then it would

445
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,840
give you the mitigation part

446
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,799
so

447
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,440
again very cool checklist knowledge base

448
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,720
items

449
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,640
i mentioned before we also have code

450
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
examples so we have many

451
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,640
asp.net

452
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,679
python

453
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,600
a lot of

454
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,919
code examples over here that you can

455
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,120
look into

456
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,000
get feedback see how certain things are

457
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,840
approach right so really on a detailed

458
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,640
level we show why we do it comment and

459
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,400
so on and so on

460
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,440
um

461
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,000
good thing is everything in skf what i'm

462
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,960
showing

463
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,840
comes as is right so if you download skf

464
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,160
all the data all the knowledge all the

465
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,200
good stuff is in there but if you say

466
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,960
you know what i have my own code

467
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,039
snippets because i'm using i don't know

468
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,520
this framework or this or that you can

469
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,400
just simply remove them and

470
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,480
inject your own code snippets there

471
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,520
right

472
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,200
the same for the knowledge base items

473
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,120
you can just extend them add your own

474
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,200
knowledge base items in it and it's

475
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,559
great

476
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,559
well the other thing was the labs right

477
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,200
so here we have the labs and like i

478
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,240
mentioned before here we can just uh

479
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,840
have a super huge list geoshop and skf

480
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,160
labs that you can start directly from

481
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,840
skf so how does this work skf is running

482
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,880
in a kubernetes cluster and all the labs

483
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,120
can be deployed in this kubernetes

484
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,960
cluster so on the moment i click on

485
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,919
action start it's now actually building

486
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,160
and deploying a lab and making it

487
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,679
available in the the kubernetes cluster

488
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,960
so we have

489
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,919
this url we can go there

490
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,400
and boom here we have now a nice

491
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,720
application that we can uh well do some

492
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,640
hacking on right

493
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,520
this is a very simple one so maybe it's

494
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,520
uh fun to do it very quickly let's see

495
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,360
so we have here

496
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,120
a piece of code

497
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,760
and what is this doing it is actually

498
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,679
having a pull down menu

499
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,320
and as you can see the value is text

500
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,360
slash intro.txt so

501
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,160
what if we do a direct local file

502
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,919
inclusion in here so we change it to

503
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,240
slash eighty say password a yes the

504
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,840
first one submit and there you go

505
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,720
so

506
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,120
very simple one but uh

507
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,679
again safe environment for you to to

508
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,080
play around and and hack

509
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,039
and

510
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,799
don't get me wrong this was the easy one

511
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,280
we also have some very challenging uh

512
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,840
race conditions jwt

513
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,120
uh

514
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,679
formula injection and other good stuff

515
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,159
and uh well don't forget there's also

516
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,039
jew shop so you can also go full in with

517
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,679
the juicio blab as well and and do all

518
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,600
the stuff there

519
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,679
then the last thing i wanted to show you

520
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,640
is the

521
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,679
manage projects so in here this is the

522
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,000
the expert wizard what i was talking

523
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,280
about where we can utilize the security

524
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,840
requirements checklist like the mobile

525
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,080
or the application security verification

526
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,799
standard and we can use them to generate

527
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,520
the right set of requirements for what

528
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,159
we want to achieve so the idea would be

529
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,640
simple you go there to your project we

530
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,400
created a project

531
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,240
and then we can select

532
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,120
what are we building a web app a mobile

533
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,520
or we use our custom checklist

534
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,000
so we use it we say we're going to do

535
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,559
web and well here is an explanation of

536
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,039
the the level so i'm going to select

537
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,799
level 3 because we're going to build a

538
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,720
critical application

539
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,080
and here we have the different

540
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,400
categories so let's say i'm going to

541
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,200
build a feature that is going to

542
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,760
take user input so i select the category

543
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,200
validation

544
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,440
and now i get a couple of questions over

545
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,559
here so do you want like phone numbers

546
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,559
and whatnot i will say yes

547
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,320
i'm also getting something from the

548
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
local file system

549
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,280
and

550
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,559
let me see

551
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,440
i'm going also to use sql so this is the

552
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,840
expert wizard i select those questions

553
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,240
i'm going to build uh not an existing

554
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,159
feature but i'm going to build a new

555
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,440
feature

556
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,320
i will call the feature full bar because

557
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,080
full bar is awesome

558
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
so and now what it will do if we say

559
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,960
submit skf will correlate

560
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,919
based on the questionnaires to the asvs

561
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,159
in this sense in this case and will

562
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,120
select for us from the 300 requirements

563
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
only the requirements that are now

564
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,200
applicable for the change and the

565
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,280
feature we are going to build

566
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,000
so now you have this list of uh

567
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,960
requirements to take into consideration

568
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,799
when you are going to build your project

569
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,159
right so you not only have like

570
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,559
functional requirements but boom

571
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,480
now you also have your security

572
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,640
requirements and again if some of the

573
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,559
requirements doesn't make a lot of sense

574
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,799
you can always click you know you get a

575
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,200
bit more information you see that we're

576
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
also referencing here to the cheat

577
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,320
sheets for this requirement also to the

578
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,679
cwe meter website and in some cases we

579
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,159
also have like the code slash testing

580
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,559
tab where the explanation would be hey

581
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,640
this stuff you can maybe check using

582
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,120
this tool

583
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,240
this can be exported you if you are like

584
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,080
an admin you can also

585
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,400
uh mark those things and all that you

586
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,240
know like hey i solved them or hey this

587
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,840
is a false positive

588
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,039
um you can also import it into another

589
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,159
awesome oas project called defect dojo

590
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,120
right the vernability management system

591
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,280
great project as well definitely look at

592
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,400
that one um yeah and really

593
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,880
everybody this is really a nutshell and

594
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,360
a very quick overview of what skf can do

595
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,760
i hope i at least gave you the right

596
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,240
pointers right that you have an idea

597
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
the demo environment you can always go

598
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,360
there

599
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,000
so you can skip login you're a normal

600
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,400
user you can use all the features you

601
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,640
can deploy labs and you can go all in

602
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,919
yeah

603
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,320
so that is the small demo of skf

604
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,640
yeah and also uh the last couple of

605
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,520
minutes what i wanted to say with the

606
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,640
google summer of code we have uh uh yeah

607
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,200
a great student working very hardly on

608
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,120
this new release that we're going to do

609
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,000
as well

610
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,320
so today actually with the help of

611
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,120
vulcan we're going to release the masves

612
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,520
feature questionnaire knowledgebase

613
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,440
items and all that good stuff in the new

614
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,960
release of skf and in about between now

615
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,880
and a month we're also going to release

616
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,440
this new feature that you're seeing over

617
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,760
here so remember that the lab that i

618
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,880
showed you

619
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,120
and where we can practice our security

620
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,080
skills

621
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,559
so now in the upcoming release that we

622
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,120
will do in between now and a month

623
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,000
the lab will all look like this and like

624
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,440
a browser-based editor where first you

625
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,080
can you know follow the skills

626
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
follow the

627
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,640
the path of exploitation and doing

628
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,480
really the offensive part right of the

629
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,159
lap but now you can also train and and

630
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:50,960
uh

631
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,880
practice all the design patterns that

632
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,799
you learned in the asvs masvs the skf

633
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,360
knowledgebase items code examples you

634
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
can practice them now here as well so

635
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,600
you can dynamically update here the

636
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,799
application

637
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,640
the lab will be reflected with the

638
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
updates that you have done and then you

639
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,279
can again verify if your implementation

640
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,919
your secure design patterns were correct

641
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,919
or not right you also have a nice

642
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,400
terminal here so in the future you can

643
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,600
also run some dust sauce and other type

644
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,279
of tooling

645
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,440
again to really help the developers from

646
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,679
a to z

647
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,240
and and learning as much as possible

648
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,919
over the whole cycle

649
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,760
right

650
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,840
um so we have a couple of places where

651
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,720
you can find us we have the getter

652
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,880
channel we have the oauth channel where

653
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,520
you can find us and of course the demo

654
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,760
environment of skf

655
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,400
if you google oas skf then you'll also

656
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,320
find the skf

657
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,039
page in in owasp there's also a bit more

658
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,039
information like the the github where

659
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,200
you can download it what the credentials

660
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,120
are what the setup is and all that good

661
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,240
stuff and walkthroughs ah yes indeed and

662
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,320
uh and walkthroughs that is correct for

663
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,159
all of the labs we actually also have

664
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,960
walkthroughs i didn't show you that but

665
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,559
definitely check the demo try it locally

666
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,880
play around with it you will probably

667
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,440
see a lot more

668
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,279
yeah that i couldn't explain in this

669
