1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,030
[Music]

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,679
so if we just jump right into it folks

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,240
uh by introductions i'm tom brennan i

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,160
was involved with the owass foundation

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,679
for many many years served on the board

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,600
of directors for 10 years

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,359
and also helped stand up the new york

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,480
city awash chapter um sam

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,039
yeah and uh i'm sam i'm always planning

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,800
the chapter leader so i'm an application

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,119
security consultant uh working for the

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,119
financial services sector in the city of

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,719
london

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,680
excellent

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,079
so today's uh presentation uh is to give

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,320
a little bit of history as well as some

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,200
suggestions for the future uh for awash

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,440
chapters uh many of you that are on the

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,600
session or watching the recording might

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,120
be interested in either starting in my

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,039
wash chapter or maybe even restarting in

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,960
a wash chapter but we're going to

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,640
provide some tips and tricks that might

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,039
be helpful for you in in doing exactly

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,440
that so let's get started

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,160
so in our community you know we are

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,239
mostly comprised of technical resources

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,680
technical people that are really good at

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,799
what they do

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,640
and of course we have a discipline of

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,960
working with you know zeros and ones or

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
three-tier architectures and application

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
security that's a great thing and that's

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,799
certainly core to the many of the

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,479
technical resources that are associated

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,000
with with owasp

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,840
but this is different than running a

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,200
chapter

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,799
many of you are also familiar with

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,119
building computers working on technology

41
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,640
and going ahead and setting up a

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,400
standards-based environment so you can

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,439
go ahead and run your favorite

44
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,680
applications and again

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,040
very different from running a chapter

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,640
and then there's also folks that like to

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
follow plans and be really you know

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,240
beyond step here with being able to

49
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,600
build or architect something whether

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,240
that be a house or or something else but

51
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,399
just like a chapter it's very useful to

52
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,479
have sort of guidelines and understand

53
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,560
sort of how that chapter could be built

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,079
and of course there's always room for

55
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,479
customizations and modifications but

56
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,159
again without having sort of clear

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,399
understanding as to what the policies

58
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,399
are what the processes are how to work

59
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,079
things within the uh the chapter

60
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,159
guidelines it can be you know a little

61
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,960
uh lonely and more importantly you might

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,119
be able to get some scale if you look at

63
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,239
some of the resources that we're going

64
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,239
to talk about

65
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,560
so from my experience as mentioned

66
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,360
with the oas new york city chapter

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
again large metropolitan region

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,840
and my experience there was probably

69
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,680
different than other other cities or

70
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,120
other countries

71
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,360
but ideally it was really about one

72
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,440
thing bringing together like-minded

73
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
people and trying to understand sort of

74
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
how we can collaborate for the common

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,200
good which was focused around the oas

76
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
foundation's mission and goals

77
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,599
in new york um like also new jersey

78
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,280
because they are very close and we did

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,040
have a hybrid chapter which was a new

80
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,959
york new jersey chapter

81
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,560
we would basically organize meetings

82
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,480
with like-minded people and what was

83
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,959
important just like a an organization

84
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,200
structure is knowing sort of

85
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,840
which people had what roles so

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,519
in our chapter what was very very useful

87
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,280
at the time was making sure you had a

88
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,440
number of individuals that would share

89
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
in the passion be able to share in the

90
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
spotlight or share in the work and be

91
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,959
able to you know be able to pass the

92
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,959
torch as needed because again running a

93
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,280
chapter is exhaustive it takes a lot of

94
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,080
time

95
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,480
and certainly could be very rewarding

96
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
personally by networking and meeting

97
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,400
people as well as potentially advancing

98
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,640
your tactical knowledge but again to be

99
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,519
clear

100
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,040
we think it's very important to make

101
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
sure you have multiple people in the

102
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,360
chapter that share a common bond and a

103
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
common understanding

104
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,560
so

105
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,599
one of things that i think that's

106
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,720
important

107
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
on the historical side is to understand

108
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,280
sort of what's changed and and more

109
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,680
importantly as to how your chapter can

110
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,480
easily utilize the policies operational

111
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,040
processes that have been defined and

112
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,640
also introducing some of the great work

113
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,239
that sam has been doing at the oash

114
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,040
chapter side so with that sam maybe what

115
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,120
we should do is really just reinforce

116
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,560
some of the conversation here and then

117
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,760
highlight some of the great things you

118
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,400
guys have done at the london chapter

119
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,720
so let's go back to the mission of owasp

120
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
right the mission of the organization is

121
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,640
still very much the same as it's been

122
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,200
from its initial founding as a 501c3

123
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,360
not-for-profit which is to help the

124
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,439
organization and help the community

125
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,879
understand software and software

126
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,079
security this is not a business

127
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,680
association this is not a member serving

128
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,600
organization this is a not for profit

129
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,199
501c3 which is a little bit different to

130
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,280
ho to certain service and help the

131
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,680
community at large so you know without

132
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,600
borders and without agendas you know

133
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,199
we're focused on the mission of software

134
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,560
security

135
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,520
um

136
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,919
the projects that owasp is involved in

137
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,080
has grown in here quite quickly over the

138
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,040
years

139
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,720
but at this point sam how many projects

140
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,479
do you think o wasp actually has on it's

141
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,960
on it's on it's on its list these days

142
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,000
i think it's around 300 but that number

143
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,560
is constantly growing every day because

144
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
every day i'm seeing more and more

145
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
projects that i've never seen before

146
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,919
which is great and as you know with the

147
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,360
current technologies there are new

148
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,080
projects uh appearing uh new uh

149
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,680
standards projects which is great so

150
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,919
things like um cloud native security

151
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,520
standards which is a recent one

152
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,560
container security standards um uh

153
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,039
internet of things uh related uh

154
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,160
standards in top ten so uh i think uh

155
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
we're doing quite good in catching up

156
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,720
with all the latest technology out there

157
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,840
and uh because everything's open source

158
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,759
um we're open to collaboration from

159
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,240
everyone absolutely so just think about

160
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,000
that for a moment just take a pause if

161
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
you had a chapter anywhere in the world

162
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,039
and you wanted to bring together

163
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,800
like-minded people you wanted to have

164
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
topics to talk about well right away you

165
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,800
already have about 300 topics to discuss

166
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,720
right these are existing projects in

167
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,199
various stages of their incubation um or

168
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,880
various stages of the revolution excuse

169
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,600
me

170
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,680
but being able to pick one and be able

171
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
to collaborate with people in the room

172
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
about what does this project do

173
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,000
is a conversation it is a discussion and

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,360
then perhaps there's people in the room

175
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
that want to demonstrate it or they

176
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,120
wanted to research it prior to the

177
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,039
meeting they want to talk about it or

178
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,479
better yet maybe you reach out to the

179
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,160
project leader and you ask them if they

180
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,080
wouldn't mind either traveling virtually

181
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,400
or traveling physically to speak to your

182
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,440
group

183
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,360
so there's great opportunities here and

184
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,800
the content is really what i'm getting

185
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,520
at is the content of owasp is very rich

186
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,039
and there's lots of great information

187
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,039
available to you so when you're looking

188
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,800
for content and saying oh it's difficult

189
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,560
to get speakers i would always say we'll

190
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,240
turn back to the foundation's core

191
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
purpose of being which is trying to

192
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,400
raise visibility for software security

193
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
and those products are a great place to

194
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,080
start in addition to other uh you know

195
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,680
conversational items that you guys want

196
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
to consider doing

197
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,039
and this plays really well into

198
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,800
recruiting attendees

199
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,880
if you do a presentation around owass

200
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,199
foundation and you speak to things like

201
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,280
the os top 10 which is once again very

202
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,759
popular with the new release for 2021

203
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,000
well you're going to draw a large number

204
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
of individuals that want to listen and

205
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,479
learn

206
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,560
so again recruiting attendees isn't

207
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,319
really difficult i don't think for

208
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,759
people that are demographically

209
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,160
interested in software security and if

210
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,400
you stay very focused on software

211
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,039
security um then everyone will always be

212
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,720
in a common space they'll always know

213
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,800
sort of what to expect other than wasp

214
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,680
they're not going to show up at an

215
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,360
overwatch meeting and hear about how to

216
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,599
fix a car unless maybe you're hacking

217
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,599
the can bus right but at the end of the

218
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,680
day if we're looking at

219
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,280
you know what the meeting's purpose is

220
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,120
and what the focus points are

221
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,639
recruiting attendees are always going to

222
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,960
be demographically interesting and tied

223
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,919
to everyone from cios and cisos and

224
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,840
developers and managers and directors

225
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
you have a very wide

226
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,360
wide opportunity to talk to different

227
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,880
types of people

228
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,520
and with that talks about membership

229
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,759
so keep in mind that organizations like

230
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,319
the oas foundation are very important to

231
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,319
not only themselves but also to the

232
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,879
people that we serve at a larger scale

233
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,960
so in order to have a voice in order to

234
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
help the organization shape its

235
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,160
direction in order to

236
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,800
either be for or against certain aspects

237
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,319
of you know where the organization may

238
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,319
or may not want to go in the future it

239
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,639
does go back to democracy it does go

240
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,720
back to a democratic vote it does go

241
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,280
back to members casting a vote for

242
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,039
leaders casting a vote for different

243
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,280
actions and we always encourage chapter

244
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,240
members

245
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,560
to become part of the foundation's

246
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
membership and because you're a part of

247
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,319
the local chapter it's kind of like

248
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,840
being able to go anywhere in the world

249
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,680
and share your card at the door and be

250
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,759
welcomed with open arms to a place where

251
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,680
you might be traveling to it's a great

252
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
experience actually uh to go to any

253
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,440
chapter around the world when you see

254
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,559
they have a meeting because they're all

255
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,559
publicly advertised be able to show up

256
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,640
and say hey i'm i'm in here today from

257
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,399
new york or i'm here from kansas or i'm

258
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,880
here from you know taiwan where wherever

259
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,919
you happen to be in the world it's a

260
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,000
great opportunity to uh sort of make

261
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,440
those connections and they're very

262
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,839
valuable

263
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,320
thank you i would like to add here toma

264
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,839
about the introductory uh talk so if you

265
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,320
are a uh i know as chapter leader or if

266
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
you're thinking of studying a chapter as

267
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,800
tom just said it is very important to

268
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,959
actually do that introduction to your

269
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,200
attendees where you will tell about what

270
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,080
is how big is owasp what is our mission

271
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,320
our purpose uh but most importantly you

272
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
also need to tell them about the value

273
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,839
of membership and

274
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,600
that is what um i think the uh very very

275
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,480
important part of anawa's

276
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,440
chapter meeting 100 100 and we're going

277
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
to see a lot of that as sam steps

278
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,240
through some of the great

279
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
accomplishments they've accomplished in

280
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
london it's a good model

281
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,440
but again keep in mind as you run your

282
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,880
chapter the value to the participants

283
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,560
it's one thing to

284
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
bring together um

285
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,279
individuals for a particular technical

286
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,600
topic or a what i would call a marketing

287
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,000
conversation around a typical

288
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,080
widget or service that's a little bit

289
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,920
different than an owasp sort of

290
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,480
get-together or a community meeting

291
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,920
getting like-minded people to just

292
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,839
socialize and come together and share

293
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,080
tips and knowledge and and they might

294
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,920
you know might be some opportunities

295
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,519
for people that are looking to get hired

296
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,680
or there might be some job situations or

297
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,440
there might be some technical mentoring

298
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,399
going on

299
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,680
or people want to break into the

300
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,360
industry and want to learn you know who

301
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,200
who they can be connected to there's a

302
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,519
lot of dynamics that happen at a chapter

303
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,279
so think about that in context of

304
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,160
perhaps again perhaps perhaps you look

305
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,360
at the guidance that we're going to go

306
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,399
over and you sort of model your chapter

307
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,880
to that guidance such as having your

308
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
meetings consistently

309
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,880
meaning you may want to consider having

310
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,839
your meetings monthly or quarterly

311
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,360
whatever the minimum requirements are of

312
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
course to check the box but more

313
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,560
importantly if you're having a

314
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,200
consistent meet up or consistent meeting

315
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,880
then people know that perhaps the third

316
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,320
wednesday of the month there's a meeting

317
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,720
happening at a particular location now

318
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,800
if you move the meetings location to

319
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,880
location that may be very useful for

320
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,000
moving things around let's say a

321
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
metropolitan city like we did in new

322
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,839
york or if you always have it at the

323
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,920
same location or the same pub or the

324
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
same location people again can be

325
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,680
consistent and know that on a particular

326
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,120
date particular time of the month

327
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,959
they're going to be able to go there

328
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,480
adding the virtual component you know

329
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
we're going to hear about that as well

330
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,720
but being able to now be very fluid and

331
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,800
have it be normal it's great for the

332
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,560
technology chapters right we can do an

333
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,079
event where that we have a physical

334
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,839
presence and then be able to potentially

335
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,920
live stream it or no physical presence

336
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,320
at all and basically live stream content

337
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,000
from you know from the uh from the

338
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,680
chapter side which again we're going to

339
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,880
hear about

340
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,120
keep in mind your your members

341
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,680
keep on your members to involve them in

342
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,399
your chapter if they are individuals

343
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,000
that are life members or they you know

344
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,399
they donated 50 to become a member of

345
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,720
the foundation that's fantastic but make

346
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,399
sure that's engaging make sure you

347
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,920
recognize those people make sure that

348
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,079
they if you give out sticky badges or

349
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,440
you're doing something to identify

350
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
people by name perhaps you want to

351
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,399
highlight those individuals perhaps you

352
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,560
want to ask them why they're you know

353
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,920
why they feel it's valuable to be a

354
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,079
member and in many cases it's because

355
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,600
the knowledge that they are learning

356
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,920
from the foundations and its members and

357
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,079
it's very useful to be part of the club

358
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,600
if you will

359
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,279
also membership does have some values

360
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,959
that we'll talk about shortly

361
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,000
and then lastly for me sponsorships

362
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,800
unfortunately nothing happens um in in

363
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
the real world without you know

364
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,399
sponsorship in some cases right you

365
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,000
can't get the pizza and beer if you

366
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,680
can't find someone to pay for it makes

367
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480
sense so it's always important to

368
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
understand sort of where that line is in

369
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,279
the sand

370
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,120
and having an organization understand

371
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,959
that we're going to help bring together

372
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,800
a bunch of people that are technical and

373
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,959
we'd like to leverage or utilize your

374
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,959
your space for that your office space in

375
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,360
some cases and then the the sponsor may

376
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,480
say well that's great we're looking to

377
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,240
hire a bunch of people so it's a win-win

378
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,200
right you're going to bring a bunch of

379
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,120
people we're going to be here maybe we

380
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
help kick off the meeting as the sponsor

381
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,040
and say hi to everybody

382
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
you know that's very useful um and again

383
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,120
be very careful with sponsorships right

384
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,040
sponsorships need to be sort of

385
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,880
understood as to what the mutual value

386
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,560
is and of course we're going to talk a

387
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,920
little bit about how the money flows as

388
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
well with some of the new policies and

389
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,279
procedures that are in place but make

390
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,720
sure you have fun with it

391
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,040
organizations you know want to support a

392
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,959
community a mission a charity they want

393
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,120
to be part of that and i think overwatch

394
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
foundation gives you a great place to

395
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,959
start with those items so sam want to

396
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,760
tell us about london

397
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,279
yes uh so uh oas london chapter is

398
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,399
actually uh quite an old one um it

399
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,720
started in 2004. uh currently we are on

400
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,880
the media group we have over 1 000

401
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,360
members uh but our meetings are

402
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,000
currently attended well in pre-pandemic

403
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,839
world

404
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,880
um by anything between 100 and 300

405
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
people and that actually became a bit of

406
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,120
a problem because it is relatively easy

407
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,600
to find a venue in london with a

408
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
conference room big enough for 100

409
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,560
people with a screen

410
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,760
and microphones but

411
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,160
as we started growing and more and more

412
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,000
people started attending and we realized

413
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,839
that when we started

414
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,440
announcing an event for let's say for

415
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,320
100 attendees all the tickets were

416
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,560
disappearing within a matter of hours

417
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,920
which was unbelievable and

418
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,839
there was a um

419
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,920
a meeting venue space at one of the

420
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,519
sponsors at expedia i think it was

421
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,399
called the ship and uh because the event

422
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,320
was completely booked out and myself and

423
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,000
my chapter colleague sheriff and super

424
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,279
looked at each other and said okay we're

425
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,120
gonna need a bigger ship because this

426
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,720
one is too small now

427
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,639
okay so a little bit about the almost

428
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,079
london chapters quite interesting tommy

429
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,079
if you can um um on to the next slide to

430
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,560
show us the interesting email which was

431
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,600
actually uh on our mailing list

432
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,040
from dan cuthbert back in 2004. this is

433
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,959
actually the the

434
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,000
date of birth of owasp london uh where

435
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,320
they um they all met in a pub so the

436
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,560
stan cuthbert presented today as well

437
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,399
one of the founding fathers of us as

438
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,160
well the denis cruz and uh daffy suggest

439
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,040
who is

440
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,519
a um known as a creator of the burp

441
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,279
scanner for example there a lot of very

442
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,880
interesting people just got together in

443
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,760
the pub and that's where all was london

444
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,560
uh meetups were and i joined them only

445
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,760
in 2008 as an attendee and i was just

446
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,240
attending became a member and um i found

447
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,639
that owasp is amazing and it has a

448
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,120
tremendous value for me and

449
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,800
in 2015 um

450
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,079
we were asked myself and sheriff to

451
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,320
step in and become chapter leaders

452
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,480
because the previous leadership actually

453
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,360
moved to a different country so uh one

454
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,279
of the first challenges that we had was

455
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,759
where do we find the speakers so tom if

456
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,839
you move to the next slide i'll find you

457
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,560
the first speaker uh that we discovered

458
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,639
who is our local guy in the uk but he

459
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,600
was not from london he was from um north

460
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,440
of the uk and that's scott helm of

461
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,839
course the um one of the famous guys in

462
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,279
application security he actually

463
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,000
traveled down uh to london to present

464
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,920
his talk on um

465
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,800
uh

466
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,120
content ejection cross-site scripting

467
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,959
and hsts

468
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,959
which is absolutely fantastic we had

469
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,399
lots of lots of people

470
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,040
uh attending this talk and

471
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,959
again one of the interesting things was

472
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,880
about for example sponsoring travel

473
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,959
because uh sometimes if you don't have

474
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,240
speakers locally you can actually um

475
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,560
[Music]

476
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,920
invite speak

477
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,440
good speakers you know some famous

478
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,880
speakers to come and present and again

479
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
uh rather than you know expensing it

480
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,839
because of course the travel requires uh

481
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,000
money um were actually quite lucky

482
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,920
because expedia was actually sponsoring

483
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,279
this and they provided a hotel voucher

484
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,120
and a travel voucher for the speaker to

485
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,680
travel so again we didn't need to spend

486
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,800
any of our

487
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,040
own money so this was great um and um

488
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,720
yeah

489
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,880
tom i think let me see if i can actually

490
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,959
move on to the next slide myself if not

491
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,720
i will ask you to move to the next one i

492
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
think it's best if you move the slides

493
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,680
um

494
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,559
you talked about hacking cars and we did

495
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,599
have a fantastic talk about hiking cars

496
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,000
and also hacking iot devices and toys

497
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,199
and

498
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,079
which was a quite a scary token

499
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,520
also talks about um uh security of

500
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,119
drones and we were demonstrated um

501
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,079
how to actually uh hack a drone while it

502
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,119
is a

503
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,080
middle of its flight and it was amazing

504
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,640
so uh i think this is attracted so many

505
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,480
attendees to our events it's just

506
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,039
unbelievable we also managed to locate

507
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,960
and invite uh great

508
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,440
great speakers presenting talks on um

509
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,280
ransomware for example

510
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,480
and i'm going to talk about where to

511
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,000
find speakers if you're struggling to

512
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
find speakers because of course the

513
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,640
talks is one of the core things that uh

514
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,960
we do at oas chapter but another thing

515
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,520
that we do is training and that is

516
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,679
capture the flag events and what is

517
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,240
great about capture the flag uh um

518
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,640
tournaments is again you

519
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,360
we just partner up with a platform

520
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,880
provider there are several um uh secure

521
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
coding training providers and capture

522
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,600
the flag

523
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,400
platform providers who are happily

524
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,480
providing their platforms for free to

525
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,039
owasp and oas members and we run several

526
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,039
events which were really really really

527
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,960
successful and

528
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,280
we had sponsors donating prices that you

529
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,440
can see there in the corner that we had

530
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,559
headphones we had drones uh i think

531
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,520
somebody donated a bottle of whiskey uh

532
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,400
t-shirts um alexa speakers you name it

533
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,520
this uh

534
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,720
absolutely absolutely great event and um

535
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,480
the actual um

536
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,679
atmosphere

537
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,880
at these events is is so good and what

538
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,200
was also good for us as a noaa's chapter

539
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,679
usually when we have our regular events

540
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,280
with talks there is one type of audience

541
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
coming to these events when we announced

542
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,640
that we're doing a capture the flag

543
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,480
tournament for developers out of the

544
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
blue there were hundreds of people

545
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,080
coming to these events i've never seen

546
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,360
about because usually you get your

547
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,600
regulars right so you would see the same

548
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,200
people coming over and over again and

549
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,440
then there were developers and these are

550
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,280
people never turned up at any previous

551
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,919
events and um again we ran our

552
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,919
introductory slide deck at the beginning

553
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,679
so people learned about owasp what it is

554
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,039
about

555
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,360
and how to join our wasp and this is how

556
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,039
we managed to grow our chapter and um we

557
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,280
had absolutely amazing feedback so tom

558
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,480
if you move to the next slide you will

559
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,240
see some of the great feedback that we

560
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,760
received

561
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,080
and people basically saying on twitter

562
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,200
oh my god this is such a great um event

563
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,400
and we had uh people traveling from uh

564
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,320
other countries actually to attend

565
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,200
capture the flag events um and uh

566
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
winning drones which is great

567
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,480
and think about this too right as

568
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,240
chapter leaders right there's no reason

569
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
why we can't do chapter to chapter

570
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,160
conversations or chapter to chapter

571
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,799
competitions so that think about a as a

572
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,480
capture of the flag let's say in your

573
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,799
region of the world um and of course

574
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,720
based on time zone perhaps you want to

575
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,640
run multiple ctfs from multiple

576
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,400
locations and if that's possible you can

577
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
actually have a

578
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,280
chapter verse chapter sort of approach

579
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,720
so you can kind of make it fun right

580
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,159
that's what these organizations and

581
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,400
these chapters are supposed to be um so

582
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
consider that as you as you look at ways

583
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,760
to put together fun and interesting

584
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,159
events but as sam said a lot of great

585
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,120
feedback came from his events and um and

586
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,960
sam if you if you like we can uh

587
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,400
continue please

588
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,679
yeah sure and um yeah i think um about

589
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,600
the chapter to chapter we actually did

590
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,440
run such an event last year it was

591
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,720
actually only well we actually run it

592
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,240
for two years so

593
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,720
uh we had it with owa's bristol chapter

594
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,880
once and then we had a uk-wide

595
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,720
tournament last year in the midst of the

596
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,039
pandemic this was all virtual all done

597
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,000
on zoom like we're speaking to uh to you

598
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,159
right now and it was very very

599
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,280
successful so it works across boundaries

600
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,440
and there are people joining and yeah

601
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,280
then they received uh

602
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,640
real prizes um sent to them by uh

603
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,720
sponsors uh by regular post which was

604
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
great and the things that we discovered

605
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,039
how to do the membership drive right so

606
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,480
what we tell people is first of all that

607
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,159
the membership fee is not uh an entry to

608
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,320
the club and without this video that you

609
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,480
are not a member of the club no you you

610
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,159
are a member everyone is welcome to

611
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,240
attend oas but the reason why you would

612
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,320
want to become a member first of all is

613
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,679
because that your membership is a

614
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,080
donation so it's not about 50

615
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,400
per year it's your donation which

616
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
actually helps the foundation its

617
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
projects and the chapters it actually

618
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,159
helps everyone to advance the mission

619
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,480
because we are a non-profit foundation

620
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,799
and another important thing is right to

621
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,280
vote because once you become a member

622
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,880
and once you start attending all the

623
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,280
events you start realizing okay these

624
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,400
are the things which are happening in

625
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,280
our wasp um maybe we want to change the

626
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,720
direction to go to this uh shiny new

627
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,440
thing and whatever it is cloud internet

628
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,080
of things uh industrial con control

629
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,120
systems um now we have self-driving cars

630
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,039
right and we say oh maybe we don't have

631
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,960
enough direction but if you become a

632
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,760
member you can vote and you can vote for

633
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,880
um the board members who

634
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,440
will actually deliver the mission and

635
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,000
you can become um you you can become a

636
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,159
board member yourself and be elected as

637
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,799
well another great advantage is that you

638
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,400
get discounts to many international

639
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,240
cyber security events if you're an os

640
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,000
member and

641
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,679
brand new benefits of being a member

642
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,360
that you get access to application

643
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,600
security training platforms

644
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,960
um and if you pay 50 dollars per year as

645
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,880
a member or you know 20 dollar

646
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,120
fee is for a student

647
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
then you get access to exclusive

648
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,799
training courses which otherwise you'd

649
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,880
have to pay thousands of dollars for and

650
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,520
i think this is absolutely amazing value

651
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,760
um and of course another important thing

652
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
is that you get your vanityoas.org email

653
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,360
address and uh it's not just to say oh

654
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,320
i'm a member of owasp but also it gives

655
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,039
you access to unlimited google workspace

656
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,280
and and

657
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,919
unlimited um cloud storage as well and

658
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:14,880
that's

659
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,240
the space where you can store the

660
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,919
presentation that's where i saw all my

661
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,400
presentations and recordings of all the

662
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,280
all the events and um you know um

663
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,559
another very important thing for the

664
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,480
chapters how to grow it is publicize it

665
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,000
if people don't know you exist how

666
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,159
they're gonna attend it right so this is

667
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,320
what we do we show to people how can

668
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,960
they follow us um of course mailing list

669
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,280
is one of the original social media and

670
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
it still exists and a lot of people

671
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,039
prefer to get an email rather than get

672
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:41,919
on

673
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,720
social media networks but we

674
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,960
do provide them with the

675
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,240
mailing list

676
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,080
twitter which is very important i think

677
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,440
for any information security

678
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
professional facebook which also brings

679
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,960
us a lot of new audience uh of course we

680
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,679
have uh oas slack and a lot of people

681
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,080
especially developers right who are on

682
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,000
slack the whole day they actually quite

683
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,279
like slack

684
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,919
of course on meetup but also on linkedin

685
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,600
to attract professionals who are

686
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,159
networking on linkedin but very

687
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,840
important social media of course is

688
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,360
youtube and having your own youtube

689
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,440
channel where you can publish the

690
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,080
recordings of the events

691
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,039
and

692
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,880
uh also do the live streaming as we

693
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,960
discovered live streaming has been

694
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,240
absolutely

695
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
crucial in

696
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,080
getting more members more attendees and

697
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,240
growing our chapter and one of the

698
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,760
interesting things about the live

699
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,279
streaming thomas if you move to the next

700
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,480
slide is

701
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,559
um it is not that difficult to actually

702
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,360
set this up so all you need to have is

703
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,760
actually a selfie stick right which i

704
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,279
showed a little further

705
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,200
uh and you will uh your mobile phone

706
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,120
that's it and you can see that one of

707
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
the photos here i was actually using my

708
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,039
selfie stick with my phone to live

709
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,559
stream um one of the events um and it is

710
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,039
very very simple you and everyone has a

711
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,960
phone in their pocket and you all need

712
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,480
to do just connect to wi-fi and start

713
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,400
streaming um

714
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,039
and later on we actually

715
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,039
got a video camera for recording and get

716
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,600
higher quality videos as well but i can

717
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,840
assure you you can watch a lot of the

718
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,919
live stream uh recordings on our west

719
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,600
london youtube channel it's still a

720
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,120
perfectly acceptable quality and it's uh

721
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,559
absolutely amazing because when you're

722
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,720
live streaming one of the advantages is

723
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,559
you attract bigger audience from all

724
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,159
over the world because people on youtube

725
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,000
are going to discover it discover your

726
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,919
live stream and another great advantage

727
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,919
of live streaming is that people from

728
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:36,799
other

729
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,799
parts of the world or people watching

730
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,120
your talk remotely your event remotely

731
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,880
they can ask questions they can

732
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,960
participate in q a

733
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,320
that's why live streaming is so

734
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,919
important not just uploading the

735
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,679
recordings of the events and of course

736
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,120
another important thing is how do you

737
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,360
find sponsors

738
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,600
finding sponsors was actually not that

739
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,960
difficult in london because we are

740
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
blessed we have got big companies and

741
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,159
they are interested as tom said they uh

742
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,720
were very happy to invite us so you can

743
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,120
see on the first photograph um facebook

744
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,640
london headquarters and on the second

745
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,880
one it's a microsoft reactor london

746
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
space which is actually specifically

747
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,279
being created for meetups for uh

748
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,840
technology meetups and um these

749
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,240
companies were more than happy to

750
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,520
host the events and also to

751
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,400
pay for catering for pizza and beer uh

752
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
and at the beginning

753
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,039
they just say well hi we're this company

754
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,279
and uh yes we're hiring uh we would like

755
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,400
to welcome uh all the auras but in this

756
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,240
you can see what our offices look like

757
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,760
and if you'd like to work here just come

758
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
and talk to us after the event so it

759
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,240
works both ways

760
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,000
beneficial and something to add to that

761
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,840
for for venues right vending is always a

762
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
very important part of where you get uh

763
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,039
spaces for

764
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,000
um in new jersey uh in the united states

765
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,559
we also took leverage across the country

766
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,400
with also other venues so if you have

767
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,559
any members in your community or in your

768
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,919
in your chapter that happen to be

769
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,159
veterans uh maybe you can consider using

770
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,240
the american legion or the or the

771
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,080
veterans of foreign war

772
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,240
or a public library there's different

773
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,080
things you can do in structure if you're

774
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,120
looking for space that is either zero or

775
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,440
low cost and in many cases

776
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,960
one of the sponsors will be happy to

777
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,440
sort of help that so it's a win-win

778
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,120
totally and if you move on to my next

779
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,039
slide home you will see that reaching

780
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,720
out to universities is very important

781
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,080
because first of all you will get

782
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,000
students who are currently studying in

783
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,919
the computer science or if they're

784
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,760
studying

785
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,279
security and we're actually quite

786
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,520
successful in promoting all was to them

787
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,120
but else it allows us to get venues

788
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
because university is another sort of

789
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,159
free venue uh event and basically once

790
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,760
we managed to grow our chapter to the

791
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,440
size that we said okay now we're ready

792
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,440
to host a big global application

793
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,799
security in europe and we're actually

794
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,039
blessed that in 2018 we hosted a uh an

795
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,039
application security europe conference

796
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,039
and we had hundreds and hundreds of

797
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,120
attendees from all over the world and it

798
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,760
was amazing seeing uh oh wasp logo and

799
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,000
all was plug that's your words open web

800
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
application security flying right next

801
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,360
to the uh iconic westminster abbey uh in

802
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,600
london so um tom that's is actually

803
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,120
photographs on the next slide if you

804
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,799
move on to the next slide people will

805
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,279
see it and of course when we you

806
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,559
organize events you have to remember

807
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,480
that oasp is all about community and

808
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,320
community cannot survive without

809
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,799
volunteers so i'd like to say a

810
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,799
huge thank you and

811
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,880
big shout out to all our volunteers who

812
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,880
are supporting not uh

813
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,640
london not just for all wasp events but

814
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,399
also for outreach events because we've

815
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,840
done events uh like besides uh london we

816
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,320
have done uh black hat europe as well

817
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,840
and there are lots of lots of people who

818
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,760
are there to come and support because

819
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,840
once people start coming to the events

820
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,399
and enjoying them they will be able to

821
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,080
uh offer their help and of course

822
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,000
another very important thing is on the

823
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,279
next slide home is um the after party

824
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,440
what we discovered going to the pub and

825
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,039
networking with the people after the

826
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,039
event after the talks is just as

827
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,960
important because that is the

828
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,399
opportunity for people to actually talk

829
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,919
to each other because during the event

830
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,200
they just sat and they're watching the

831
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,679
talk and the after party is very very

832
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,919
very important and uh yeah just a couple

833
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,840
