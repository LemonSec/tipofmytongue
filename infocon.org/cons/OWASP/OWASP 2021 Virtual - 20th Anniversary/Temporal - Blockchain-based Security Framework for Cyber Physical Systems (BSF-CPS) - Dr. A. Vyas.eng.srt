[Music]

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,400
so as podemo mentioned the topic is

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,960
blockchain based security framework for

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,719
cyber physical system

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,039
as we know that cyber physical systems

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,520
are very very complex systems and these

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,920
are also known as a class of automated

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,960
systems

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,560
which are basically working as a

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,119
lifeline of our smart cities

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,320
and

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,679
cps are transforming the way we interact

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,480
monitor and control you get it together

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,399
physical world around us i think you

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,600
have to go on mute sonata

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,719
okay

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,840
you have to mute yourself

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,039
don't need

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:45,430
this

20
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,280
[Music]

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,000
where i want to be yeah okay

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,800
so the security aspects of these systems

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,440
are in high demand as these systems are

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,719
involved in day-to-day life of people

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,440
and the national economy and compromised

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,479
cps can harm the day-to-day operations

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,760
of the people and cps systems are very

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,520
complex in design because very

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,080
heterogeneous devices are involved in

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,479
working of cps systems and these are

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,960
more prone to cyber attacks so in

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,119
today's talk i am going to discuss that

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,280
how we can introduce blockchain

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,159
technology and i am going to share one

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,560
framework also which i have decided

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,960
that i am going to work on as a future

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,439
aspect and future research aspect and

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,119
which is basically a mechanism to

39
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,040
gaining trust when we are sharing the

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
data when the data is transmitting from

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,720
cps to the other devices so in that this

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,040
is the uh table of content which i have

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,159
decided

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,399
so a little bit description about the

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,799
cyber physical systems

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,840
risk evaluated risk associated with gps

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,799
security how we can introduce blockchain

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,560
and what is the framework which i think

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,439
that we can go ahead with

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,240
so

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,399
so i was talking about cyber physical

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,079
devices that these can be considered as

53
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,639
a systems which integrates sensing

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,840
computation control and networking into

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,160
physical objects as you can see in this

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,040
slide also physical sensing is there we

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,280
have a strong network through which all

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,480
the devices are connected and

59
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,360
actuation information also so in cyber

60
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,000
physical system we can sometimes like

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,440
integrate or we can say that uh iot is

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,840
also quite overlapping in that because

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,319
the line and the distinction with iot

64
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,599
and cps is little blurred so we can say

65
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,920
that the advancement of cps is very fast

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,000
including we can say that electrical

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,160
power generation and delivery

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,720
personalized healthcare traffic flow

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,280
management and emergency response and as

70
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,760
well as in many other areas now just

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
being envisioned so as you see in this

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,800
picture many millions of connected cps

73
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,599
devices will be communicating

74
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,840
over the public network and will be

75
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,400
providing services to their respective

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,840
applications uh many applications of cps

77
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,319
the identity of devices is very very

78
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,239
important and data

79
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,480
generated from these devices

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,360
uh

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,400
from an important part of the overall

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,040
ecosystem they are integrated in because

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,360
when we are giving a cyber capability to

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
this system the cyber capability is

85
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
basically working on the data which is

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,560
collected from the various devices which

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,720
are connected in the system

88
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,640
if the data which is coming from these

89
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,239
devices is not consistent if the data

90
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,000
which is coming from these devices is

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
not secure then how the system is going

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,040
to function because these kind of

93
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,159
systems are known as a backbone of any

94
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,920
country's economy because these are the

95
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,720
bigger and complex systems

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,439
so

97
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,959
in the uh

98
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,599
challenges in the situation we can say

99
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,239
that how basically the actors are

100
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,640
gaining the trust in the integrity of

101
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,000
identities and the data in an explicit

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,720
measurable and testable way because

103
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,879
whenever you are receiving a data from

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,918
any device how you are going to trust

105
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,680
that this is the data which is not

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,880
hampered or this data is real data so

107
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,639
this is the main uh

108
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,880
you can say that the challenge when you

109
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,720
are talking about the communication in

110
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
the cyber physical systems

111
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
now detection of safety and security

112
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,919
deficiencies and as a fundamental

113
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,560
building block for creating a security

114
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,840
framework for cps at different various

115
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,560
level we have a physical level

116
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,479
we have another logical level then we

117
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,919
have a different layer

118
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,720
users are interacting so various levels

119
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,199
are having various security and

120
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,520
safety deficiencies so we need to work

121
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,759
on a framework which can target all

122
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,240
those uh deficiencies maybe not all the

123
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
most of the time the cyber physical

124
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,759
systems internet of things and digital

125
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,919
frameworks are we can say that generally

126
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,400
the cases of embedded devices

127
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,720
in which the basic requirement is to

128
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,880
provide the flexibility to the various

129
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,759
applications because we have devices

130
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,000
from the heterogeneous vendors so we

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,160
want that flexibility that as and when

132
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,720
we need a device we can add or we can

133
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,360
detach that device but the system is not

134
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,520
going to deviate from the normal

135
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,680
operations that will not affect the

136
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,320
working of the complete system that we

137
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,840
know and also we want the higher

138
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,280
adaptability of those devices which are

139
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,120
heterogeneous in the nature which are

140
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,440
coming under the cyber physical system

141
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,000
to provide a reliable communication that

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,320
whatever data is flowing from these

143
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,360
channels

144
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,160
all the data we can trust and we can use

145
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,400
for the analysis purposes or for taking

146
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,360
the decisions for the other purposes so

147
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,840
that is very very important and the

148
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,479
existing platforms use the centralized

149
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,440
networking and now according to me and

150
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,360
the research which i did is suffering

151
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,639
from security scalability and big data

152
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,319
problems so

153
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,199
security and privacy is a significant

154
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,080
challenge in cyber physical systems

155
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,639
as you see in this slide mirai botnet a

156
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,880
ddos nightmare turning internet of

157
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,600
things into botnet of things

158
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,080
what's happening is ddos attacks target

159
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,720
the cyber physical system resources and

160
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,520
the launch uh from a large number of

161
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,199
locally infected devices so a huge in

162
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,400
network of cps devices

163
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,919
will be targeted by the ddos attacks and

164
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,800
these are exploited by the botnets uh

165
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,199
and whereby the large number of infected

166
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,000
devices simultaneously launch ddos

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,639
attack so multiple devices will be

168
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,840
compromised and all are basically

169
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
targeting

170
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,680
a cps system

171
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,160
now in this case as i mentioned the

172
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,840
mirai uh

173
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,120
so you can say that ddos attack can take

174
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,599
many different forms like black hole

175
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,720
teardrop while ddos can take the like

176
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,840
forms like thing of death smurf and

177
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,759
black energy series so i'm not going in

178
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,599
the technical detail of all these

179
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,639
attacks tcp sync flood which exploits

180
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,840
the tcp handshake process uh by

181
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,160
constantly sending requests without

182
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
responding back to the server now

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,319
causing the server to constantly

184
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,280
allocate space or waiting for reply and

185
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,520
because of that that server is not able

186
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,360
to respond to the request which is

187
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,240
coming from the legitimate clients and

188
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,319
this is basically leading to the buffer

189
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,680
overflow condition

190
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,919
where the situation can come in which

191
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,160
the cps system can crash or shut down or

192
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,400
deviate from the normal operations

193
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,960
malware is most of the time used to

194
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,639
compromise cps in order to steal or leak

195
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,840
data or harm any device or bypass any

196
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,319
control systems because we know that we

197
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,360
need a human less automated process so

198
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,520
there is no human but the human is

199
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,919
operating the system so we have to take

200
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,000
that when any human is operating a

201
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,120
system how secured this system

202
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,520
which is operated by a human what kind

203
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,599
of security measures are taken care by

204
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,919
this system which is handling the data

205
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,479
which is coming from the various devices

206
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,880
so the attacks which we discussed like

207
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,919
mirai

208
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,839
attack was very very huge attack in 2016

209
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,039
uh mootbot attack in 2020 while pressure

210
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,519
and victory gate attack in 2020

211
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,519
these are very very large scale and if

212
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,680
i'm not going to mention the ransomware

213
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,320
attack i think i'm going to miss a big

214
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,600
name

215
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,920
so ransomware is a malicious software

216
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,040
that basically holds and encrypts the

217
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,480
cps data as a ransom and this is by

218
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,120
exploiting the cps vulnerability as i

219
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,880
told you that there are number of

220
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,279
devices in the cps system as you see

221
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,600
over here so we are not sure that how

222
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,240
many devices are secure how many devices

223
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,640
are patched with the security how many

224
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,680
devices are basically working as for the

225
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,560
requirement of the system so because of

226
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,800
those kind of vulnerabilities the

227
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,200
attacker is able to gain access and they

228
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
are targeting oil refineries they are

229
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,440
targeting power grids they are targeting

230
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,399
manufacturing facilities so we seen that

231
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,080
these are the things and if we want to

232
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,480
see the examples of ransomware

233
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,040
siskiy in 2016 wannacry in 2017

234
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,600
bad rabbit in 2017 these are the few

235
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,080
names which are the big names in the

236
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
ransomware attacks econs in 2020 so

237
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,519
these are the attacks which are planned

238
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,320
so these are the challenges facing by

239
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,959
the cps like heterogeneity in the device

240
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,440
resources as we discussed multiple

241
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,920
attack services are there because there

242
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,000
can be a physical attack there can be a

243
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,160
cyber attack so in cyber attack because

244
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,079
they have a heterogeneity in the devices

245
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,399
sources and these devices are having

246
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,760
very less

247
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,880
uh power to compute or

248
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,360
process so these kind of problems are

249
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,000
there scale is very huge because we are

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,720
talking about millions and billions of

251
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,200
small small devices number of sensors

252
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,959
which are attached everything is

253
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,600
centralized if one thing goes wrong the

254
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,680
complete entire system is going to be

255
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,800
shut down

256
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,680
lack of control over how data is shared

257
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,279
because when we are talking about this

258
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,240
scale

259
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,040
we can control but up to this level it

260
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,839
is difficult to control and manage

261
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,560
so audit facilities also needs to be

262
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,240
take care that how we are auditing the

263
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,040
things

264
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,399
also the

265
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,320
software stacks and hardware how you are

266
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,160
updating the things like if you are

267
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
using a software how updated that

268
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,720
software is is your hardware is capable

269
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,240
enough to matching with the current

270
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,920
security requirements

271
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,320
also the poor implementation of security

272
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,800
and privacy mechanism so these are the

273
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
main challenges which are faced by the

274
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,959
cyber physical system

275
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,880
so is there another way forward through

276
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,839
which we can implement the security or

277
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,839
through which we can think that okay now

278
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,399
my data is safe so i can say that

279
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,880
blockchain is the answer so blockchain

280
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,839
as a name suggests is a growing chain of

281
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,680
blocks

282
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,200
so in this these blocks are containing

283
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,839
the data of various kinds like the data

284
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,320
can be financial transactions related to

285
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,920
exchange of assets

286
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,839
or linked together using the

287
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,120
cryptography

288
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
like in blockchain transaction these

289
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,600
basically these are recorded as

290
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,000
like chronologically and these are

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
forming the immutable chain and that is

292
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,880
basically creating a trust because in

293
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
that process data is verifiable and

294
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,440
auditable now the ledger is distributed

295
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,079
across all participants in the given

296
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,360
network

297
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,399
right and what is happening in that is

298
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,120
because of this immutability property of

299
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,440
blockchain and a clever mix of

300
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,480
cryptography and a game theory everyone

301
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,279
in the network agrees with a single copy

302
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,160
of

303
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,880
blockchain

304
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,320
now

305
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,639
in addition to like being a system of

306
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,160
records where you have everything

307
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,240
recorded you have a chain of custody uh

308
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,519
basically we can say uh that

309
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,920
blockchain can also be a platform for

310
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,600
smart contracts

311
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,320
now uh we can if you want to describe a

312
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,800
smart contract so it's an autonomous

313
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,600
agent which is stored on the blockchain

314
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,000
and is encoded as a part of spatial

315
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,480
transaction now which introduces the

316
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
contract to be blockchain

317
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,680
now one can also view uh as a smart

318
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,000
contract as a state machine

319
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
with its current state

320
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,800
like represented on the blockchain so

321
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,959
any transaction invoking a smart

322
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,079
contract stored on the blockchain and

323
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,599
will trigger its execution

324
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,360
now once it finish executing all

325
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,240
renewable actors in the network

326
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,800
uh agree on the new state of the smart

327
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,720
contract so whenever there is a change

328
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,279
in the state trigger will happen and all

329
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,959
the actors in the network will be

330
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,519
notified and will be agreed with the new

331
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,480
state of the smart contract now

332
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,800
the blockchain is offering a different

333
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,519
path towards the greater security

334
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,480
and

335
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,959
that is like we can uh

336
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,880
we can say that we can trust the data

337
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,399
which is coming from this chain of

338
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,120
custody because this is immutable and

339
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,519
the approach is basically reducing the

340
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,240
vulnerabilities and provides a strong

341
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,720
encryption and also more effectively

342
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,199
verifies data ownership and also the

343
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,399
integrity

344
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,040
so this particular basically giving an

345
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,240
advantage uh that use of distributed

346
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,320
ledger and everybody is agreeing with

347
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,199
the new states whenever it's coming so

348
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,560
this particular public key

349
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,760
infrastructure model reduces many risk

350
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,279
associated with centrally stored data by

351
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,079
eliminating the most obvious targets and

352
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,480
that is basically comes where the

353
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
everybody is trusting with the

354
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,279
blockchain

355
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,320
which is the chain which is immutable

356
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,639
blockchain contains many non-traditional

357
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,519
features also uh it take advantage of

358
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,320
one of the most important cyber security

359
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,040
tools which we all know and which we all

360
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,360
agree that is encryption so this is the

361
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,279
traditional security feature which is

362
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,000
used by the blockchain also distributed

363
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,079
laser can utilize the public key

364
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,040
infrastructure to secure communication

365
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,360
also to authenticate device

366
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,600
now 98 percent of the iot device target

367
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,199
was unencrypted a recent study of polo

368
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,720
alto network reports this issue and also

369
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,639
say that low hanging fruits for the

370
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,160
attacker because when you are not

371
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,839
encrypting your data

372
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,279
in rest

373
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,959
and in transit

374
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,360
you are inviting attackers to come and

375
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,720
attack you to access your data

376
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,199
so if we say so what are the blockchain

377
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,360
challenges we are so happy that okay we

378
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,000
are going to use blockchain or we are

379
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,959
going to have the uh facilities of

380
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,759
blockchain so what kind of challenges

381
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,440
are there when we talk about the

382
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,519
blockchain so

383
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,759
organizations from multinational

384
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,399
corporations to governments are

385
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,320
uh basically adopting blockchain

386
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
security and

387
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,199
basically this is not simple as updating

388
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,000
the existing toolkit because these are

389
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,639
the big smart systems and as a whole

390
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,120
like we cannot say that now i'm going to

391
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,279
change everything i'm going to uh

392
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,759
redesign the complete system entire

393
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,079
system using the blockchain so there are

394
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,680
a lot of challenges which are involved

395
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,759
in that so and the challenges we can say

396
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,880
is the data privacy scalability so data

397
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,040
privacy we can say that if in the public

398
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,360
blockchain anyone can see and retrieve

399
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,839
data in the transaction right and that's

400
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,240
a concern for businesses so blockchain

401
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,920
is providing security but we talk about

402
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,639
the public blockchain so anyone can see

403
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,759
and retrieve data in the transaction and

404
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,160
concern for businesses that want to

405
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,880
closely control what information is

406
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,959
publicly available so that is the main

407
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,880
concern of the business when they wants

408
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,680
to switch to the blockchain scalability

409
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,480
is also a concern and it's so basically

410
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,440
uh become a constraint when implementing

411
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,399
blockchain because due to block size and

412
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,160
the response time

413
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,120
now we want to work on the security but

414
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,440
then if the latency is much if the

415
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,320
response time is very very low uh high

416
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,639
then it is difficult to implement that

417
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,959
so in this technology basically every

418
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,240
node

419
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,160
is storing

420
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,679
and processing

421
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,559
and maintaining the transactions in a

422
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,760
block to ensure security and privacy now

423
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,319
as the number of transaction increases

424
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,720
small and medium size businesses i am

425
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,039
talking about that struggle to

426
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,880
accommodate a growing number of

427
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,599
transactions in a block

428
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,600
so that's a challenge in terms of

429
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,760
scalability if we talk about the

430
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,080
regulations the organizations and the

431
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,679
businesses are still trying to

432
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,960
understand that how blockchain structure

433
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,160
complexity fits within the evolving data

434
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,320
privacy compliance and regulatory

435
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,679
landscape because we know that gdpr uh

436
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,280
is basically telling that if you are

437
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,320
dealing with the public uh pii you have

438
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,960
to comply with certain standards so how

439
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,320
these things will be matching with

440
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,880
blockchain that is also a big concern

441
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,200
interoperability like some blockchain

442
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,480
platforms use a very ecosystem

443
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,799
for their smart contract logic

444
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,120
transaction scheme models but weak

445
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,720
interoperability because we know that we

446
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,080
have the heterogeneous systems now if

447
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,640
there are no not interoperable then

448
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,720
what's the point of implementing a new

449
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,360
technology for giving security because

450
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,840
then you have to do a new work for

451
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,160
providing the interoperability amongst

452
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,080
the devices

453
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,400
so these kind of roadblocks from the

454
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,120
developer perspective also taking a back

455
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
from the businesses

456
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,360
by implementing the blockchain as a

457
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,240
security now technology risks are also

458
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,120
there as improper key management and

459
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,480
access control also like blockchain is

460
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,200
offering lot of benefits as we discussed

461
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
the efficiency the optimization

462
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,760
reduce control improve security but then

463
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,600
improper key management and access

464
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,160
control needs to be taken care because

465
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,400
this is not going to be a traditional

466
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,919
way this is going to be a different way

467
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,360
where the

468
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,039
keys will be mapped with the user

469
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,000
ownership and unauthorized access or

470
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,960
theft of cryptographic keys may lead to

471
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,919
total loss of the data so we need to

472
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,840
take care about the improper key

473
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,160
management and access control also

474
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,559
unintended forks and chain split attacks

475
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,760
which are there

476
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,480
that is also a concern in adequate

477
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,360
encryption scheme selection and insecure

478
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,360
operations are also a risk which is

479
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,600
there in the technological area and the

480
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,000
api integration is also the important

481
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,880
point

482
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,360
because uh third parties are always

483
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,080
required for api integration whether

484
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,640
it's a private or public blockchain now

485
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,600
that leads to trust issues because now

486
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,520
you are having the different verticals

487
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,840
to trust you are implementing a new

488
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,600
technology but then also you have to

489
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,480
trust on the third party services so

490
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,400
these are the few challenges but then

491
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
also i think

492
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,400
that if we are going to uh introduce

493
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,360
blockchain as a security for these smart

494
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,640
systems uh cyber physical system

495
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,760
that will provide a more impact on the

496
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,400
security as you see in this particular

497
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,440
diagram

498
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,400
the basic design of blockchain-based uh

499
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,919
cyber physical systems uh is that cpas

500
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,679
are basically linked to blockchain

501
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,559
leader

502
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,559
which is distributed amongst the actors

503
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,000
in the ecosystem

504
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,320
then what happen is the key blockchain

505
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,080
features which we discussed like which

506
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,679
are providing efficiency which are

507
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,440
providing the security

508
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,840
uh will achieve the data stored on the

509
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,600
blockchain and

510
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,760
smart contracts executed by the

511
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,840
blockchain are trusted amongst the

512
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,080
actors which are there

513
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,000
and everybody is going to agree on the

514
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,840
new state which is coming after each and

515
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,440
every transaction

516
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,120
now in this process a cts devices are

517
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,600
trying to send something to client and

518
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,919
client is ready to record the data so

519
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,400
whenever client means it is representing

520
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
the actors those who are working to

521
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,559
collect the information so whenever

522
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,440
these actors are ready to collect data

523
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,240
from cps what kind of steps will be

524
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,120
happen which can be managed and monitor

525
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,360
with the help of the blockchain so

526
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
basically if you see in this diagram i

527
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,440
have three components which i have taken

528
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,919
the first component is cps device this

529
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,159
is the first component

530
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,159
which is able to compute and to

531
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,159
communicate and which is having a

532
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,760
cryptographic identity using a symmetric

533
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,200
pair of keys now the second actor which

534
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,400
i have is the time which is representing

535
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,520
one of the actors who aims to record the

536
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,080
current process of data

537
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,240
from the cps devices with the help of

538
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,039
the blockchain and the third

539
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,000
uh which i have is the blockchain system

540
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,679
which stores and execute smart contracts

541
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,320
so this is how my framework work and i'm

542
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,720
going to share these steps also that how

543
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,280
it's going to happen the scenario is

544
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,080
that client wants to record process of

545
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,919
data uh from this device and taking the

546
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,760
help from blockchain because whenever a

547
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,600
data is stored on the client from the

548
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,720
cpas we want to have its security and we

549
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,880
want to have an authentication that okay

550
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,400
this is the correct one

551
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,520
now the first step is

552
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,400
the first step is the uh basically

553
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,600
client wants to record process data of

554
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,919
the cyber physical device on the

555
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,799
blockchain now this what he's doing is

556
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,400
he's sending a transaction to the

557
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,200
blockchain that requested nouns now what

558
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,200
is the nouns if i uh in brief if i uh

559
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,559
share the detail about nounses uh

560
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,960
is it to make each request unique

561
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,520
because we want to have a unique request

562
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,240
like nobody is able to use that nouns

563
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
again this is unique for this request

564
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,880
and it doesn't matter if the attacker

565
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,679
gets the older nouns uh because that

566
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,760
data which is happening in that nouns is

567
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,799
older and not of any use now so it is

568
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,760
important to have a nouns in every uh

569
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,600
kind of request which we have because it

570
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,640
is making a request unique so that

571
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,280
attacker cannot replay a request in

572
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,840
different context so this is the first

573
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,360
point when client is uh wants to record

574
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,760
the process data from the cps with the

575
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,360
help of the blockchain

576
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,919
so second step is blockchain is

577
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,720
basically processing the transaction and

578
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,760
sends an

579
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,240
announce back to the client that this is

580
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,840
a unique

581
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,240
particular request now client requests

582
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,120
the cps device to sign its current

583
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,880
process

584
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,080
now this data and the nouns together so

585
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,880
this particular cps device is uh

586
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,080
combining the nouns with the data and it

587
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,720
is sending back to the client

588
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,039
now if you see this fourth request the

589
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,720
message is built

590
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,240
so sign

591
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,720
uses data and nouns so now this is

592
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
signed and we are sending it back to the

593
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,919
cloud client now what is happening is

594
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,600
cps has sent the sign

595
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,159
process data and nouns to the client

596
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,720
now the client is building a transaction

597
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,600
for the blockchain that contains the cps

598
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
device id

599
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,000
the complete transaction this complete

600
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,279
uh transaction is having the cps device

601
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,720
id that from which

602
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,640
this particular things will be taken

603
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,200
device id sign data

604
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,880
and also it is going to have the nouns

605
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,600
as its payload in this transaction these

606
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
things are an action also it can be

607
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,840
mentioned that wants to store it so

608
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,559
these kind of a thing in the fifth step

609
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,159
the client is going to send to the

610
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,799
blockchain and the action is to record

611
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,679
the data as i discussed also in this

612
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,400
sixth point if we talk as a six point

613
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,880
also so in the sixth point the

614
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,480
blockchain executes a smart contract

615
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,720
and uh yeah to check the authenticity of

616
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,919
identity data and time with the steps

617
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,000
like it is going to uh

618
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,559
as a step if i want to say so verify

619
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,200
that the sign process data was signed by

620
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,159
the claim cts device also check the data

621
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,640
was signed with the correct nouns which

622
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,039
is generated for the current request

623
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,840
also if all checks are true then save

624
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,840
the data against the id on the

625
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,320
blockchain so this is how the system

626
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,960
will work and with this system i think

627
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,720
we can claim that this is satisfying the

628
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,520
security requirement and this is how we

629
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,440
can say that we are providing the

630
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,320
security to the devices in this cyber

631
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,760
physical system and we can say that

632
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,159
trust is going to be generated now there

633
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,200
are a few concerns also with this

634
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,240
particular thing like data

635
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
authentication and data integration like

636
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,120
in the proposed system if i talk so few

637
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,440
points i wanted to mention data device

638
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,120
identification also non-repudiation also

639
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,600
the secure against the deeply attacks

640
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,080
also so how this framework is working so

641
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,760
these are the few challenges on which

642
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,320
i'm working uh protection from spoofing

643
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,240
attacks so i'm working on these

644
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,480
challenges and i hope that very soon i'm

645
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,000
going to update this particular

646
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,960
framework so that my this framework is

647
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,919
able to answer such challenges which are

648
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,840
there when we are going to implement the

649
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,520
blockchain

650
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,440
and these are the few references which i

651
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,559
have referred for uh preparing these uh

652
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,679
framework and my slides and

653
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,679
i'm going to thank

654
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,640
again for giving this opportunity to uh

655
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,799
share my experience and my framework

656
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,240
with everyone

657
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,480
so with this uh i think i have completed

658
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,760
on time and uh let's see if i can start

659
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,039
yes yes so thank you so much for uh

660
