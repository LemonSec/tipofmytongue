1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,200
okay

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,960
hello welcome back after the break and

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,680
yeah it's a great honor to announce

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,760
christmas opal i don't know how to

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,199
introduce something like that everybody

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,519
knows him it has such a long biography i

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,840
think that would be by itself a feel for

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,599
old session

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,960
chris is a

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
cto and co-founder of ferrocode and he

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,920
will take us to i will understand a

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,520
brief review on the

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,200
how we went from

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,520
outsider to allies i think other people

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,760
break about 15 years experience 20 years

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,879
experience

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,120
christmas with which 25 years of

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,719
experience in the absence industry of

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,719
security industry

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,520
i saw some slides sometime jesus

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,280
i look before what there's no further we

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,840
do please chris take the stage

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,120
thank you martin it's uh great to be

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,239
here

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,840
um i'm happy to be here on this 20th

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
anniversary

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,479
um

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,320
and it's just it's amazing to me that

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,520
it's it's been

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,400
20 years since oaf started even though

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,159
i started doing this as a vulnerability

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,560
researcher before there even was really

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,920
an apsec

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,280
concept

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,200
um and so today i want to talk about

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
the relationship between application

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,400
security

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
and development teams

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,479
um i think it's vastly improved over

40
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,640
time and as william gibson has said the

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,280
future is unevenly distributed

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,680
so i think we can learn from the past

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,600
and learn from those

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,280
um that are already

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,560
living in the in the future

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,399
so just uh

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,079
to start off a few things people might

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,200
not know about me that i think

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
really were formative and

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,240
helped me

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,439
learn about software security and

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,040
testing

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,079
and

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,520
i guess to start off because i know

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,598
people will ask this question

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,399
um

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,599
that that's me on the telephone in 1987

58
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,680
um when i was a co-op student working

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,879
for ibm in boca raton i visited key west

60
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,360
and that's the southernmost telephone

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,720
in the united states i don't know if

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,959
it's still there anymore

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,480
but

64
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,920
i wanted to talk about a few things

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,840
people don't know about me because i

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,239
think they made a difference in

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,239
me going down this path

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,360
and

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,680
trying to make software more secure and

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,920
one of the things is my very first job

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,640
after i did my co-op and graduated from

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,080
from college

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,120
um

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,640
my first job was writing automated

75
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,400
software testing tools

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
at a software vendor so my job

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,200
was to

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,879
do things like

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,879
write you know inputs into uh programs

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,360
and record what the screen was supposed

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,720
to look like

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,360
and if it didn't if it didn't look like

83
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,200
that something something was wrong if an

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,640
error message came up or an error

85
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,040
message didn't come up things like that

86
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,920
and so it's the very first thing i did

87
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,680
as a software engineer was test uh was

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
test other software so right away

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,720
i got an understanding for how important

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,840
that was

91
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,959
um now this was totally functional

92
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,799
qa testing there was nothing there was

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,440
no concept of security testing back then

94
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,720
because really nothing was even

95
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,400
networked um so so but

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
um i had to work with the development

97
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,239
team right i had to work with the qa

98
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,360
team

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,200
and it was important to you know serve

100
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,879
their needs

101
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,959
to ship good software

102
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,280
um another thing that a lot of people i

103
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,959
don't think know is

104
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,760
my my father worked for over 20 years

105
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,239
for ge aircraft engines

106
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,040
and he was a materials engineer

107
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,360
and he worked in a non-destructive

108
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,959
testing lab

109
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,040
which is another way of saying

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,640
static analysis

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,239
um because of course you're going to

112
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,280
test

113
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
jet engines by

114
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,400
running them

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,680
by

116
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,079
all kinds of other

117
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,399
you know dynamic testing but he taught

118
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,400
me about static testing he taught me

119
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,040
about how they could

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
use x-rays

121
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,160
to look at casted parts to see if there

122
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,520
were any

123
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,198
fractures in those parts

124
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,360
before they would assemble

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,320
assemble

126
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,600
the machine

127
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,960
and if you could find a poor casting

128
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,199
early in the process

129
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,840
by just doing an x-ray of it

130
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,000
that saved you a lot of time and money

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,440
because you could just throw that part

132
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,400
away

133
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,960
and you didn't have to

134
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,120
find out later down the line where maybe

135
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
something would break and you would

136
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,600
waste a lot of time and other parts um

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,000
by doing dynamic testing so i thought it

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,479
was pretty interesting um the concept of

139
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,960
static uh static testing and this was

140
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,199
this was you know 20 20 years ago he was

141
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,880
talking about this and the other thing

142
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,440
was the supply chain the supply chain of

143
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,960
the suppliers that made a lot of the

144
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
parts that they assembled was critical

145
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,800
and they were always looking for better

146
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,240
suppliers and if a supplier started to

147
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
you know put out poorer quality they

148
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,600
started to they switched to another

149
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,919
supplier and i think that is something

150
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,320
that makes a lot of um there's a lot of

151
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,039
analogies to that today with using open

152
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,000
source

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,759
and even just using commercial software

154
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,800
um and then finally um one of the things

155
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,919
i did early on in my career as a as an

156
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,680
appsec professional

157
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,000
was um do consulting at uh at microsoft

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,880
and

159
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,039
together with microsoft when i was at at

160
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,880
stake um

161
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,720
i tested ias exchange sql server and the

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,560
interesting thing was these were the

163
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,039
first time that microsoft was having

164
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,400
outsiders come in to look at security

165
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,000
so there was a lot of learning going on

166
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,199
on on on both sides

167
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,160
um so to go back to the beginning um you

168
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,800
know i started as part of a hacker group

169
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,039
um the the loft

170
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,639
and uh we were clearly outsiders and i i

171
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,560
put that's the uh that's the movie

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,039
poster for the movie the outsiders and

173
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,360
no that's not tom cruise and matt dillon

174
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,479
there and patrick swayze that's that's

175
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,919
uh my fellow

176
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,600
hackers mudge and

177
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,880
dildog and space rogue at uh

178
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,080
at the loft

179
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,039
and just the virtue of being a hacker is

180
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,360
you're you're inherently an outsider

181
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,560
right

182
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,479
you're not part of the organization

183
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,240
running the software not part of the

184
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,479
organization building the software

185
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,440
you're inherently an outsider and

186
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,960
being an outsider isn't isn't

187
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,680
necessarily bad there's some good things

188
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
to being an outsider um

189
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,639
we were able to say the emperor has no

190
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,440
clothes which what we meant was you know

191
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,520
companies like microsoft weren't doing

192
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,160
security testing we could call them out

193
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,080
and we could say they can do better

194
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,479
they're they're not doing a good job you

195
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,759
couldn't necessarily do that if you

196
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,520
worked at microsoft and maybe you

197
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,599
couldn't even do that if you were a a

198
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,639
customer

199
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,919
um

200
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,000
from from a bank or someone using their

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,120
software because um you would just it

202
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
wouldn't you would your your supervisors

203
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,560
your peers

204
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
probably wouldn't look at you too well

205
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
if you if you did that that was the

206
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,639
mindset uh back in the 90s so

207
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,720
it was a bit of a privilege to be able

208
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,120
to have this alternative view

209
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,520
on software security and call them out

210
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,360
when they said hey our product is secure

211
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
it takes this many

212
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,520
you know thousands of years to crack our

213
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,400
passwords we would say actually no your

214
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,319
passwords are insecure this is why

215
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,520
you're using crypto wrong or um you they

216
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,440
would say you know we have all these

217
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,919
great you know security features

218
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,840
and we would say it really doesn't

219
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
matter because your code is riddled with

220
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
buffer overflows

221
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,560
so

222
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,360
there was there was a certain um

223
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,759
position to be in i think that was

224
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,240
important being an outsider

225
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,639
but um the the problem with being an

226
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,800
outsider though is you really can't

227
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,680
affect change right it's it's hard it's

228
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,520
hard to affect change

229
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,599
um being being an outsider but you can

230
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,919
certainly um put up information out

231
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,279
there into the world that people can

232
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,599
think about

233
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,200
um so here is my very first uh

234
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,958
piece of vulnerability research i ever

235
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,760
did

236
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,920
um from 1996.

237
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,000
um i was playing around with lotus

238
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
domino which was a web application it

239
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,120
was taking lotus notes and giving it a

240
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,040
um you know a web interface so you could

241
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,560
use it through a browser instead of a

242
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,160
fat

243
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,560
excuse me a fat client

244
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,440
and

245
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,040
um i was playing around with it and

246
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,440
playing with the urls as as you do when

247
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,720
you're doing um web web attacks

248
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,560
and i realized that um they had broken

249
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
um access control

250
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,160
i didn't know it was called broken

251
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,320
access control we didn't have the os top

252
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,399
10 or cwe back then so i just i just had

253
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,519
to um describe it as data can be edited

254
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,440
or deleted if permissions are not set

255
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,600
properly which is a little bit confusing

256
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120
but the idea was

257
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,959
you could uh

258
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,279
you could just change the url and get

259
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,959
edit or delete

260
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,519
um capabilities on on different on

261
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,000
different documents

262
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,279
um so here we are you know 25 years

263
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,360
later and what's the new

264
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,120
number one for

265
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,519
for the uh os top ten

266
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,959
um it's broken access control so uh the

267
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,720
very first vulnerability

268
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
i found and published

269
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,519
um

270
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,560
is the number one vulnerability today 25

271
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,880
years later um that that's kind of a sad

272
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,920
state of affairs um really

273
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,839
it was number five in the 2017

274
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:14,800
um

275
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,320
top ten

276
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,480
so we know about this problem really

277
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,519
well right knowledge about the problem

278
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,440
isn't solving the problem

279
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,240
um testing for this problem is still

280
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,160
is still a challenge it's still a

281
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,920
challenge to to find these types of

282
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,279
vulnerabilities and i don't think we're

283
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,560
very we're very good at it

284
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,600
um but something happened

285
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,200
after i

286
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,640
published this

287
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,360
vulnerability

288
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,839
lotus actually acknowledged

289
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,720
this on their

290
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,560
on their home page

291
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,160
lotus

292
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,800
described the problem described how they

293
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,360
fixed it gave me credit

294
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,240
um and thanked and thanked me and this

295
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
was completely out of the blue like we

296
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,399
had no expectation

297
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,399
that that this would happen

298
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,120
so there there was a sense that some

299
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,000
developers actually appreciated

300
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,399
um vulnerability research even way back

301
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,480
in 1996

302
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,040
um so that that was that was interesting

303
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,240
and it made us sort of think hey maybe

304
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,120
maybe we should talk to developers and

305
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,480
they actually invited me and mudge who

306
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
was also at the loft at the time

307
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,279
um to come and give a presentation to

308
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,040
their development team

309
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,440
and teach them about what we were doing

310
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,120
to find these to find these

311
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,360
vulnerabilities so this is way back in

312
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,320
in 1996 was sort of the first time

313
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,079
we said hey maybe

314
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,680
maybe we can work with these development

315
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,000
teams and and we can we can help we can

316
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,399
help them

317
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,680
um

318
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,399
but it wasn't always so

319
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,079
rosy

320
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,560
there was a lot of confusion

321
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,639
of what we were doing at the loft with

322
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,480
our vulnerability research and i think

323
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,760
there was

324
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,399
a ton of articles

325
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,839
that were written

326
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,320
that had headlines like the one you see

327
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,040
here that started with hackers from loft

328
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,240
break

329
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,440
and

330
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,920
instead of saying you know

331
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,959
broke

332
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,160
you know uh you know a web server

333
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,360
software or internet explorer they'd say

334
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,680
things like hackers from loft break into

335
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,200
microsoft

336
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,079
um and and so this this confusion

337
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,240
of what we were doing even though we

338
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,639
were attacking software and doing

339
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,680
software uh vulnerability research

340
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,440
there was the

341
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,839
the the the mainstream and even the

342
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,959
technical

343
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,440
world didn't really understand

344
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,360
what we were doing and why this was

345
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,880
important

346
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,200
and and thought we were actually

347
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,360
um you know breaking into different

348
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,600
organizations and you know reporters

349
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,519
would ask us why you even tell why are

350
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,959
you talking about this why are you

351
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,040
telling the world that you broke into

352
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
microsoft and so there was there was a

353
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,120
lot of confusion in the beginning

354
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,360
about what vulnerability research

355
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,680
even was i don't think it helped that

356
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,399
you know we came from a hacker group and

357
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,560
we used our hacker names

358
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,040
and our website pages were black

359
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,279
um that that certainly didn't didn't

360
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,200
didn't help they thought we were sort of

361
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,639
up to no good

362
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,880
um but but we thought we were doing

363
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,920
something

364
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,439
you know in important at the time

365
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,880
um but then as time progressed a little

366
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,760
bit

367
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,959
um it started the the vendors started to

368
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,399
understand

369
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,480
what we were doing and we weren't doing

370
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,600
this

371
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,959
to make them look bad or or with some

372
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,399
sort of criminal or even a hacktivist

373
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,560
um in intent

374
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,000
it was truly

375
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,800
to

376
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,040
look at what software vulnerabilities

377
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,639
were out there in software get an

378
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,279
understanding of that the scope of that

379
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,199
the impact of that

380
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,639
and also

381
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,760
you know give advice to these uh

382
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,519
software vendors

383
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,399
and around 1997 which i think was the

384
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,800
first year of black hat

385
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,199
um this started it started to shift a

386
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,519
little bit it started to shift that

387
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,519
software vendors were interested in in

388
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,199
learning more from us and we had a

389
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,079
meeting the loft guys had a meeting with

390
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:28,839
with

391
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,880
microsoft and um we we told them about

392
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,120
how we were finding vulnerabilities in

393
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,360
the smb protocol

394
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,959
and their cryptography

395
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,440
and how we were doing this by setting up

396
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,839
you know a lab environment and sniffing

397
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:44,959
the network

398
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,480
and you know doing packet injection and

399
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
and you know later this was automated as

400
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,160
fuzzing but back then we would just kind

401
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,920
of do it manually

402
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,639
um and you know basically

403
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,720
lots of negative testing

404
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,480
and microsoft was quite interested in

405
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,680
this and

406
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,760
after we talked to them we were talking

407
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,839
to this reporter at the ee times

408
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,040
describing what we were doing and he

409
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,000
uh wrote this article for ee times which

410
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,519
was a technical

411
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,880
magazine

412
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,600
um about uh how

413
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,320
um what we were doing was important and

414
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,279
and how we were trying to help people

415
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,959
improve their products and coming up

416
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,480
with a process

417
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,160
of improving the security of your

418
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,120
product

419
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,959
by breaking into it

420
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,480
so this was taking

421
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,120
all those testing techniques and having

422
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,000
the

423
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,880
the developer of the software do those

424
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,160
things instead of you know waiting until

425
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,800
attackers did that and then of course

426
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,959
um they they would patch they would

427
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,880
patch it but there's still sort of as

428
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,320
you can see from the picture in the

429
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,240
language there's sort of this sort of

430
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,199
this still this sort of outlaw outsider

431
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,079
thing

432
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,120
um

433
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
going on

434
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,000
but i think the thing that really

435
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,360
changed

436
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,519
from the outsider

437
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,279
and um hacker um

438
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,320
world

439
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,360
was

440
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,240
when we started to interact with with

441
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,160
microsoft more

442
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,079
and we started

443
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,600
to when we released vulnerabilities

444
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,959
something happened

445
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,639
in 1997

446
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,560
and that was

447
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,360
microsoft approached us

448
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,399
and

449
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,480
said you know what guys

450
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,399
i know you're doing interesting stuff

451
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,959
and you want to publish your research

452
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,000
but

453
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,040
if you just

454
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,360
contacted us first

455
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,800
we would

456
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,320
we would uh

457
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
we would fix the issue and then you

458
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,920
could publish

459
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,440
um

460
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,959
you know describing what you did and

461
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,959
what you found after we fixed the issue

462
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,320
and this would actually

463
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,279
fix

464
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,560
um this would protect our customers

465
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,040
and this is really i think this was this

466
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,639
was the thing that really started to

467
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,880
change things that vulnerability

468
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,199
research wasn't an outlaw

469
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,359
activity it was actually doing it was

470
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,919
doing something that vendors

471
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,839
wanted to coordinate with that vendors

472
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,160
wanted to work with and microsoft really

473
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,640
was the first one

474
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,119
out there oh it looks like i gotta

475
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,400
pop up there

476
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,679
um

477
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,919
so

478
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,679
let's see what's happening

479
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,960
um

480
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,960
so

481
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,640
microsoft really kind of put out there

482
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,360
that they wanted to work with us

483
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,678
first

484
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,039
and i think that went a long way

485
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,360
in what happened next which i think

486
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,240
completely changed us from being outlaws

487
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
to being you know

488
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,919
people used to call us oh you're now

489
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,120
white hats

490
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,960
now you're not you're sellouts now

491
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,120
you're working for the man and that was

492
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,240
when we testified um as a group as the

493
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,200
loft

494
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
um at a u.s senate hearing

495
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,160
in uh in 1998

496
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,600
and this was about three and a half

497
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,640
years

498
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,520
before uh owasp was founded

499
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,919
and i think this this woke the world up

500
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,080
to the concept of

501
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,760
um you know

502
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,520
people need to work

503
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,240
with

504
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,640
with people doing vulnerability research

505
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
like this is something that software

506
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,320
vendors need to work with government

507
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,960
needs to work with um and this really

508
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,760
was the bridge between being an outsider

509
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,919
and starting to be someone who's working

510
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,640
with people that are building

511
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,200
um built building software now the

512
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,640
interesting thing was the whole reason

513
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,799
we were brought in by the senate to

514
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,960
testify was because they wanted an

515
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,799
outsider view they didn't want the

516
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,880
government accounting office view they

517
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,080
didn't want a government-funded

518
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,439
think-tank view

519
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,080
although peter neumann testified with us

520
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,320
from you know from sra

521
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,360
and obviously a a guy who knows a lot

522
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,240
about um software failures and and

523
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,400
software security failures they really

524
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
wanted to hear what we had to say

525
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
because we were total outsiders we were

526
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,960
coming at this as independent outsiders

527
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,280
and um they even let us use our hacker

528
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,039
names you can see that we have welds

529
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,640
pond they i've weld pawn there um

530
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,480
but this is this is this really pushed

531
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,559
it pushed it forward and

532
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,799
we started to think at the loft this is

533
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,880
when we said we need to do this as a

534
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
living like we need to

535
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,799
we need to become

536
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,880
application security professionals like

537
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,880
we we we should figure out how to do

538
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,880
this as a business or join forces

539
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,520
um to to do this as a company

540
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,600
and a couple years later

541
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,720
um

542
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,160
we

543
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
we helped found a an application

544
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,120
security company at stake and and

545
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,080
started to be consultants that the whole

546
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,840
point was to work

547
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,520
with people building

548
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,480
um building software

549
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,520
and after at stake was formed

550
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,400
a couple other companies like foundstone

551
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,320
um where i think mark herfe worked at

552
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,320
the time when he founded um

553
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,240
wasp worked

554
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,080
and um in

555
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,840
this this this i'm going to put up the

556
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,960
note here

557
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,000
uh that uh mark herfe put out to bug

558
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,520
track which is the way that we all

559
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,600
communicated back then on on a mailing

560
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,480
list

561
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,679
announcing

562
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,440
um the launching of of owasp

563
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,520
with a website

564
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,400
and um a mailing list

565
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,799
and he talked about um you know having a

566
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,880
technical committee and he brought

567
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,480
together some of the people who were

568
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,640
some of the pioneers working on how do

569
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,960
we do this abstract thing at the time

570
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,559
john john villega myself greg hoagland

571
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,360
elias levy who was the moderator of

572
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,000
um bug track at the time

573
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,320
and brought us together to

574
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,880
you know form help form help form this

575
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,159
organization

576
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,360
um of o wasp um and so

577
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,679
that's i think that's that's where you

578
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,400
know the outsider part of being a

579
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,440
complete outsider a hacker ends

580
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,280
but unfortunately

581
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,679
um as as you probably all know and have

582
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,760
all experienced

583
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,520
even when doing this professionally even

584
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,720
when doing it for hire

585
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,799
there's this feeling

586
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,200
that especially in the beginning

587
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,400
that

588
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,039
people doing application security

589
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,200
are are outsiders to the software

590
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
development process

591
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,520
i think for a long time

592
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,760
we felt that we were outside

593
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,679
looking in and really not part of of of

594
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,960
the team

595
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,880
you know we were we were essentially

596
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,480
critics we were

597
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,640
not part of the creation process you

598
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,000
know a critic

599
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,960
who

600
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,760
um you know talks about you know maybe

601
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,320
how a movie script is bad or the

602
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,600
directing is bad or cinephotography is

603
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,679
bad or the plot is bad

604
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,159
um is a critic that you know does that

605
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,039
after the movie is is is done

606
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,360
and that's a lot of the ways that early

607
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,000
application security was it was brought

608
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,840
in at the end of the process

609
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,760
after something was built and it really

610
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,840
felt like we were movie critics we

611
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,559
weren't the director we weren't part of

612
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,720
the process where the director might be

613
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,919
coaching or helping an actor

614
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,720
get something right we weren't part of

615
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,480
the creation process

616
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,960
we were we were on the outside and being

617
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,440
on the outside is is pretty limiting you

618
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
can say smart things

619
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,559
um

620
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,799
but um and maybe the director will take

621
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,200
that and and and think about it for the

622
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,400
next movie

623
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,919
but you didn't make that movie much

624
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:52,799
better

625
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,240
right um

626
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
because it because it was done and a lot

627
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,320
of the early early apsec

628
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,240
was still like that

629
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,760
even though we were getting paid to do

630
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,200
that we were brought into the end of the

631
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,400
process it was very limiting limited the

632
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,440
impact

633
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,120
um we could make and that had to change

634
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,159
in order

635
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,720
for for for for software security to get

636
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,799
better

637
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,559
um so

638
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,360
uh

639
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,720
a year or so after o wasp

640
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,000
or actually i think it was only a few

641
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,400
months after olas was formed

642
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
there was the famous bill gates trusted

643
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,720
computing memo and this is where bill

644
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,679
gates

645
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,480
basically said

646
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,640
microsoft is going to

647
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,039
build secure software

648
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,120
we're going to stop what the everything

649
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,720
we're doing

650
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,799
we're going to train our developers

651
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,120
and they're going to write secure code

652
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,480
we're going to we're going to build

653
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,000
secure software and they kicked that off

654
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,039
and

655
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,039
they quickly realized

656
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,640
they didn't really know how to build

657
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,960
secure software you know there was a few

658
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,559
books and there was some things out

659
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,360
there

660
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,440
but you know there wasn't really a guide

661
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,000
that they could they could read

662
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,159
or send their developers to training for

663
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,320
back in 2002

664
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,480
so they realized they needed someone on

665
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,120
the outside to come in

666
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,039
so again this is still outsiders but

667
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,480
they were trying to bring them into

668
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,559
their environment to work with their

669
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,000
development teams

670
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,480
and so first microsoft hired foundstone

671
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,760
to come in

672
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,600
and help them

673
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,200
build secure software work with their

674
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,799
development teams

675
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,080
and later

676
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,960
they

677
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,279
brought in at stake which was where i

678
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,320
was working at the time and i i came in

679
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,200
um

680
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,799
to do consulting

681
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,720
and then once at stake was there i found

682
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,039
out that foundstone had gotten gotten

683
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,640
kicked out

684
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,000
and they had essentially replaced

685
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,240
foundstone with at stake and i had heard

686
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,360
why

687
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,720
was because

688
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,360
microsoft didn't want someone who looked

689
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,080
like an outsider and the found stone

690
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,000
employees were all wearing their found

691
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,159
stone branded you know uh golf shirts

692
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,760
and they

693
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,919
they showed up and they had these black

694
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,679
shirts that said found stone and they

695
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,440
walked around and they say oh the found

696
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,120
stone guys are here working on this

697
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,240
project

698
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,880
so they were told to blend in and dress

699
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,919
like microsoft employees and not and not

700
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,440
look like they're coming from the

701
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,000
outside because microsoft really wanted

702
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,640
to integrate

703
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,760
the consultants into the teams together

704
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,200
working side by side on the same team

705
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,520
and we were told that we had to dress

706
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,360
like microsoft employees so we couldn't

707
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
wear any branded logos

708
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,919
and we couldn't uh when when our when

709
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,840
our ceo came to visit he wasn't allowed

710
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,919
to wear tie he was supposed to look like

711
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,880
a senior manager at microsoft and and

712
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,840
they didn't wear ties uh to work

713
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,880
um

714
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,279
so uh you know this is just a stepping

715
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,200
stone in the way even when you're hiring

716
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,520
consultants trying to make it feel like

717
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,440
it's it's part of one team so this is

718
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,600
really an important journey that that

719
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,240
appsec is on

720
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,919
um so but when we were there um you know

721
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,000
we didn't have any really any automated

722
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,960
tools

723
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,600
on the in the beginning uh mostly we did

724
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,400
threat modeling and code review

725
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,000
um and that was

726
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,120
that was pretty slow um but you know

727
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,960
threat modeling was super important even

728
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,400
if it was slow

729
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,640
because microsoft didn't have any way of

730
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,000
understanding

731
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,880
their

732
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,520
their uh design flaws

733
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,039
they just didn't have any way of doing

734
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,919
that and threat modeling was a way

735
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,320
of doing that it also helped us

736
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,240
understand where the risky where the

737
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,919
risky code was

738
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,039
um if something was you know protecting

739
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,720
something from a different you know

740
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,279
security domain um that was probably a

741
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,240
critical

742
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,200
uh a critical area of code so we did a

743
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,559
lot of code review we did a lot of

744
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,880
threat modeling and of course we you

745
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,279
know we taught uh hands-on with the

746
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,200
teams this wasn't like we would just do

747
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,760
a report we would do it with them

748
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,720
um

749
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,880
we were working together

750
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,960
with the developers so i think microsoft

751
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,919
actually got this pretty early on

752
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,919
that security needed to be embedded in

753
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,200
the process

754
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,039
and um

755
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,600
and and security-trained people

756
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,520
had to be part of the team

757
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,159
um and then while we were there actually

758
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,399
dave i tell was part of the team and he

759
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,880
started writing a tool called spike

760
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,600
because he had this concept of fuzzing

761
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,279
that he wanted to do so we were off

762
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,720
doing

763
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
threat modeling and reviewing code and

764
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,600
dave is writing a fuzzer

765
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,279
and we only had about two weeks left on

766
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,720
the engagement and we said dave you're

767
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,960
not going to find any vulnerabilities if

768
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,799
you're just writing a tool

769
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,360
and he said just wait just wait once i'm

770
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,960
done i'm going to find so many

771
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,679
vulnerabilities quickly because i've i'm

772
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,399
automating the process that you guys are

773
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,279
doing

774
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,840
um by doing it and and actually dave

775
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,399
finished his tool a couple days

776
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,640
before our engagement was over and he

777
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,320
was right he found

778
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,039
lots and lots of vulnerabilities um by

779
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,440
automating the process so this is around

780
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,559
you know 2003 or so and the light bulbs

781
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,399
are starting to go on that you know

782
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,640
we're gonna we're gonna have to automate

783
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,960
automate this stuff um you know

784
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,880
everything everything was was was too

785
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,559
slow and the idea was build tools

786
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,559
you know that developers

787
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,640
could could use

788
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,200
i think the problem was in the beginning

789
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,360
developers didn't want to use the tools

790
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,760
and so appsec people used the tools

791
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
so we were using the tools

792
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,080
we had all this great automation das and

793
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,039
sas and fuzzers

794
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,440
but we we were the ones using the tools

795
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,919
and they weren't designed for developers

796
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,440
they were designed

797
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,159
you know for experts and this this this

798
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,679
kept the gap

799
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,399
um and kept us as outsiders because of

800
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,399
the design point of the tools and maybe

801
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,679
it's just that's those are the only

802
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,840
people that would use them back then

803
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,880
um

804
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,799
but uh

805
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,440
the tools were absect friendly right

806
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,600
they found lots of issues they were

807
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,159
false positive friendly i'd rather weed

808
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,480
through false positives than then miss a

809
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,799
false negative right so that's just the

810
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,000
absence mentality it's like i'm willing

811
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,320
to do a lot of work just to find that

812
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,600
one more

813
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,039
flaw clearly this is not what developers

814
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,120
want to do because they wanted to ship

815
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,480
code

816
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,360
and

817
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,240
this having having powerful tools that

818
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,480
found a lot of issues

819
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,559
the problem was it was a lot of issues

820
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,440
and success was just finding flaws so

821
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,360
there really was this

822
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,440
separation and we're sort of going

823
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,520
backwards here with automation in

824
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,399
joining forces with the development team

825
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,919
um we're

826
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,399
we're we're uh

827
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,440
we're feeling success is finding flaws

828
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,919
and this is clearly not success for the

829
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,240
development team right they want to ship

830
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,159
and they want to fix bugs they don't

831
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,480
want to just find more bugs so

832
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,000
um i feel like there might have been a

833
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,559
bit of a step backward in the early days

834
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,919
um of automation

835
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,720
and and so you know so if i think if we

836
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,480
go back 10 years

837
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,960
um you know we got all these great

838
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
educational documents we got all these

839
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,480
great tools

840
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,840
but they really weren't focused on

841
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,640
developers they were really focused on

842
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,760
on on on the apsec practitioner

843
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,240
and um

844
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,120
that that really led to a place

845
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,320
where

846
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,679
we are focused on finding finding issues

847
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,919
and just finding problems and finding

848
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,080
more and more problems

849
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,919
but then a change starts to happen

850
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,039
because

851
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,440
this can't go anywhere from here right

852
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,080
we can't just keep finding more issues

853
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,080
we really need to work with developers

854
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,360
to help them

855
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,200
fix code

856
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,279
or prevent the flaws

857
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,799
in the first place

858
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,880
so i think about 10 years ago we started

859
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,880
to see things change

860
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,720
and we started to see a focus

861
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,000
come to fixing um issues

862
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,919
and there became an emphasis on training

863
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,360
developers

864
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,480
and

865
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,080
an emphasis on

866
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,279
presenting

867
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,679
good remediation advice and sample fixes

868
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,640
and we start to see oau's projects like

869
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,000
es

870
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,679
api

871
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,840
and other secure libraries

872
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,760
as building blocks

873
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,279
that are focused on building secure code

874
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,600
not not finding

875
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,600
not not not processes to yet find more

876
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,720
issues

877
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,799
and this is where i think we start to

878
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,840
get to

879
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,760
you know modern

880
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,840
modern absec

881
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,200
which i'm much happier um to be part of

882
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,159
now

883
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,679
than absec maybe in its first 10 years

884
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,000
um and and i think it's a it's a better

885
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,960
place for for for everyone everyone to

886
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,679
be

887
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,399
it's not distributed evenly

888
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,799
there's still places where

889
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,159
uh

890
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,240
app second development don't don't get

891
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,519
along

892
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,039
um and there's still places where

893
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,440
abstech teams are all focused on on

894
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,960
finding finding problems um

895
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,960
but the next part i want to talk about

896
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,600
is you know how do we learn to

897
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,919
to solve that problem and i think one of

898
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,679
the best things that ever happened to

899
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,919
appsec was development processes

900
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,279
changing to agile and then

901
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,480
devops

902
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,679
because we became obsolete as a separate

903
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,120
security team

904
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,240
right it just it wasn't going to work

905
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,919
um if

906
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,880
if we had to have a window of time

907
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,760
where testing and fixing fixing happened

908
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,519
the code was just moving

909
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,720
too quickly and just like qa

910
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,159
and release

911
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,120
got folded into an agile

912
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,600
process

913
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,679
security started to get folded into the

914
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,200
agile process

915
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,840
and and developers got trained

916
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,159
uh up so high they became security

917
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,279
champions

918
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,399
and we even started to have

919
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,320
you know people writing

920
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,360
um

921
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,279
you know security engineers

922
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,480
writing

923
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
unique test cases

924
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,760
um actually writing code in libraries

925
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,080
right alongside as as part of the

926
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,519
development teams

927
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,399
so um this was really a forcing function

928
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,760
i feel to really modernize the way

929
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,960
uh absec absec was was working

930
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,799
and um

931
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,880
in 2017

932
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,200
um i was um at aws

933
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
re invent

934
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,640
and i saw uh uh werner vogels

935
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,120
the amazon cto

936
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,480
and he came up and he gave a

937
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,079
presentation

938
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,280
um

939
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,280
and uh on the evolving developer mindset

940
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,960
and uh

941
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,879
what he said i thought it just blew me

942
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,639
away i'm like

943
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,520
this guy gets it amazon gets it

944
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,679
um this is where we need to go and you

945
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,520
know these are his exact this is his

946
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,399
quote security is everyone's job now not

947
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,719
just the security teams with continuous

948
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,719
integration and continuous deployment

949
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,320
all developers have to be security

950
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,760
engineers we move

951
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,639
too fast for there to be time to review

952
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,800
security by the security

953
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,280
beforehand it needs automation it needs

954
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,599
to be integrated into its process

955
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,879
each and every piece should have

956
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,199
security integrated into it

957
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,079
so

958
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,839
um this is where

959
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,480
uh amazon you know was leading

960
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,918
a lot of other companies were starting

961
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,640
to do the same thing and it really

962
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,400
you know back this was you know four

963
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,560
years ago but this is where a lot of

964
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,320
companies are now

965
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,800
and you know i i see development and

966
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,000
security

967
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,240
completely you know um you know

968
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,599
converging

969
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,960
and both

970
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,320
taking the best of each other's skill

971
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,640
sets and tool sets it's about developers

972
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,760
performing

973
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,079
security practices and security

974
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,920
professionals building software and

975
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,240
writing and writing code security as

976
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,960
code policy as code

977
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,720
um and and so

978
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,960
both of us are learning from each other

979
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,680
developers and security professionals

980
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,079
and and truly becoming and becoming one

981
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,200
team and so this again isn't everywhere

982
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,520
but where this is happening

983
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,040
that is where i feel that you're getting

984
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,400
the most secure

985
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,320
the most secure software

986
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,920
so i i feel like in in lots of places we

987
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,440
really are finally

988
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,040
allies

989
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,160
developers are not on their own

990
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,079
success is being part of that team

991
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,520
that's shipping secure code on schedule

992
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,000
there's work to continually improve the

993
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,880
process better tooling

994
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,359
better integrations shifting left it

995
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,680
feels like continuous improvement like

996
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,200
this continuous

997
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,920
um progress being made and that means

998
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,079
less work to get to the same

999
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,640
secure outcome getting better at um

1000
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,480
getting to that

1001
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,560
secure code

1002
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,280
so some of the things that i've seen

1003
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,800
make this work

1004
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,599
um is really building those

1005
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,320
excuse me relationships

1006
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,599
um at the peer level you know cso or

1007
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,440
product security

1008
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,839
um leader to

1009
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,040
or absec leader to um you know vp of

1010
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,320
engineering

1011
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,200
um

1012
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,960
you know security practitioners apsec

1013
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,520
engineers and developers

1014
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,440
working together meeting with them

1015
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,599
understanding each other's goals

1016
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,640
being sympathetic to each other's

1017
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,839
each other's struggles so really an

1018
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,040
understanding um and that's that's what

1019
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,359
you need to become one team and part of

1020
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,680
that is shared accountability you need

1021
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,280
to have shared accountability it has to

1022
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,839
be part of the goal of both teams

1023
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,400
to ship secure code on time you know

1024
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,119
part of security's goals should be how

1025
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,599
are we enabling the development team not

1026
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,200
to slow down

1027
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,119
and part of security's goals is how are

1028
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,240
we enabling more the appsec team

1029
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,760
to test better

1030
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,480
and and and how we able to

1031
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,119
you know follow their guidance or even

1032
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,839
auto remediation so it's it's it's

1033
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,320
accountability um and it's got to be

1034
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,880
measured and and reported on

1035
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,359
so um i have a few slides here that

1036
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,320
are

1037
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,720
how we've seen processes improve across

1038
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,079
our customers

1039
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,000
um at veracode

1040
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,200
and

1041
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,839
um we we took a look at this and we we

1042
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,200
had to split the process improvements

1043
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,720
across

1044
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,839
um two different two different domains

1045
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,200
and we realized that some applications

1046
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,240
um just by their very nature

1047
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,520
are going to be harder to secure

1048
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,040
and some are going to be easier to

1049
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,760
secure so we wanted to look at what

1050
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,240
processes can be used to secure the hard

1051
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,280
ones and the easy ones so we looked at

1052
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,839
the nature of applications

1053
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,560
and we looked at what's what's an ideal

1054
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,720
environment for an application to be

1055
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,680
secure it's a small application with a

1056
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,640
small organization a low flaw density

1057
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,720
and it's it's relatively new

1058
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,520
that's just easier to secure

1059
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,320
um

1060
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,839
and and what are those

1061
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,839
less ideal environments

1062
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,560
it's a large organization it's a large

1063
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,320
application it's old there's a lot of

1064
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,599
legacy code it has a high flaw density

1065
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,119
that's much harder to to improve but

1066
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,440
there are improvements we can do

1067
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,839
for those those different types of

1068
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,000
applications so we call that the nature

1069
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,680
of the application that's our starting

1070
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,400
point

1071
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,359
but then there's the nurturing um part

1072
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,359
what is what is that what does the ideal

1073
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,640
team do

1074
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,040
um to nurture application security

1075
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,680
regular frequent scanning variety of

1076
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,079
ways of testing

1077
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,680
the application

1078
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,680
um and then you know what are what are

1079
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,160
what are poor ways of doing this just

1080
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,920
using one technique like just using

1081
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,599
static analysis

1082
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,760
um and then just doing this

1083
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,640
on

1084
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,079
an annual basis or a quarterly basis or

1085
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,480
irregular intervals like don't do it for

1086
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,880
a few months and then do it intensely

1087
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,119
right before you ship the code so those

1088
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,640
are some of the things we've seen be

1089
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,040
better or worse with the way people are

1090
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,760
using you know verico's automated

1091
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,200
testing

1092
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,119
and we took all the different things

1093
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,720
that we've seen

1094
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,760
um

1095
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,400
our customers do and we rank them by

1096
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,000
what's helping um and and what's hurting

1097
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,400
um remediation time so what's making it

1098
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,960
easier to fix a bug and what's making it

1099
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,040
harder to fix a bug and we want to learn

1100
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,760
what makes things easier to fix flaws

1101
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,599
because it's of course

1102
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,200
let's do more of that it's great to

1103
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,920
prevent them with libraries

1104
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,960
and and developer training but at the

1105
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,880
end of the day you're going to have

1106
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,480
flaws

1107
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,680
just like you have quality and

1108
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,760
performance flaws and you need to deal

1109
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,720
with them so what are what are the ways

1110
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,319
that we found

1111
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,119
changes the average remediation time so

1112
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,880
we saw that if people are using multiple

1113
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,839
testing techniques like das and sas

1114
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,280
on average

1115
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,240
that makes it 24.5 days between

1116
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,400
discovery of a vulnerability

1117
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,640
and the

1118
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,119
fixing remediation that vulnerability 20

1119
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,400
24.5 days quicker on average

1120
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,480
scanning more frequently

1121
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,000
um

1122
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,240
you know so moving from maybe a monthly

1123
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,839
basis to a weekly or daily basis

1124
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,599
made it so that it was 22 and a half

1125
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,280
days quicker on average to fix a

1126
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,720
vulnerability um using apis which i

1127
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,920
think is a proxy uh to call your testing

1128
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,960
a proxy for integrating it into your ci

1129
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,079
pipeline or your ide so that's shifting

1130
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,760
left and getting more continuous we saw

1131
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,400
that people that used our apis versus

1132
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,480
versus people who just sort of

1133
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,400
uploaded their application to us and did

1134
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,599
it you know

1135
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,760
once every once in a while we found that

1136
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,000
the the api usage

1137
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,839
people were fixing their vulnerabilities

1138
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,720
17 and a half days on average quicker

1139
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,960
doing it doing scans in a steady way

1140
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,640
instead of bursting

1141
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,800
15 and a half days

1142
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,000
and teams that used

1143
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,839
sca

1144
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,079
software composition analysis even if it

1145
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,000
was something that

1146
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,440
um you know wasn't necessarily fixing

1147
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,359
it wasn't the flaws that were it wasn't

1148
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,200
finding vulnerable libraries just teams

1149
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,720
that were using that

1150
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,960
maybe it showed maturity

1151
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,520
but they were fixing things six days

1152
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,280
faster than average

1153
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,440
and then the bad news was if your app is

1154
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,520
older just by the fact that it's being

1155
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,200
older it's going to take you three days

1156
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,680
on average longer to fix flaws if you're

1157
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,000
coming from a large organization it's

1158
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,400
going to take you 14 days on average

1159
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,240
a large application

1160
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,920
is is really just the worst right

1161
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,800
that was 57 days later to remediate on

1162
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,040
average and just a high flaw density

1163
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,920
which i think is you know legacy code or

1164
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,560
perhaps using languages like c plus plus

1165
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,280
which have a higher flaw density or php

1166
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,079
which has a higher flaw density

1167
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,800
that that that that took longer on

1168
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,839
average to fix a flaw so we like to try

1169
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,760
to learn from process

1170
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,319
and and see how we can recommend to to

1171
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,160
people how to how to improve their

1172
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,560
process

1173
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,400
um and then this is just a chart to just

1174
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,599
show you the data of um of how we did

1175
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,480
this

1176
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,839
and um

1177
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,359
you know you could see

1178
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,040
that

1179
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,079
even with it was a good environment

1180
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,079
taking good actions reduced the

1181
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,160
half-life of a flaw from 25 days to 13

1182
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,160
days so even if you're in that great

1183
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,240
environment of you know small

1184
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,520
application new code small team

1185
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,839
taking the actions of you know using

1186
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,440
apis to call testing integrating it in

1187
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,680
using multiple testing types can pretty

1188
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,720
much cut your remediation time in half

1189
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,240
from people who aren't doing that that

1190
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,880
was really really good news

1191
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,200
um but the bigger difference is for the

1192
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,720
people that are coming from a poor

1193
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,000
environment

1194
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,520
um

1195
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,319
they

1196
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,760
can increase the the half-life by four

1197
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,319
months so it's a little hard to see on

1198
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,119
the chart but i think we're going from

1199
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,560
on average around

1200
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,119
about

1201
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,359
10 months on average to fix it to

1202
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,079
remediate a flaw once it's found to six

1203
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:18,960
months

1204
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,000
so just changing your process no matter

1205
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,400
what kind of environment you you have

1206
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,560
to to embed um you know abstract

1207
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,720
process and people into your team is

1208
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,800
going to isn't going to make a is going

1209
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,480
to make a huge difference

1210
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,560
so now in the last couple minutes i just

1211
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,920
want to talk about

1212
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,079
you know the the future

1213
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,319
um where where where are we going where

1214
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,200
is oauth's going i think the one of the

1215
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,800
big things that we're seeing happening

1216
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,880
is supply chain

1217
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,640
both on the micro level

1218
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,480
which is you know libraries and

1219
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,640
components and packages developers are

1220
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,599
using and on the macro level you know

1221
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,359
what relationships does your

1222
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,160
organization have whether it's buying a

1223
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,079
sas application using external apis

1224
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,839
um

1225
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,280
just what what software are you

1226
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,560
purchasing

1227
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,280
and um we're seeing that owasp is has

1228
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,599
been on the leading edge of of supply

1229
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,240
chain for for a while with you know

1230
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,480
first dependency checker now dependency

1231
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,800
check and dependency track

1232
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,040
and cyclone dx

1233
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,280
these are all things that um

1234
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,359
you know the s bomb

1235
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,599
excuse me project is looking at and and

1236
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,359
the new government standards we're going

1237
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,720
to see coming down

1238
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,599
um are are looking at as as as leading

1239
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,560
ways

1240
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,520
of managing supply chain risk

1241
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,079
and the asvas project

1242
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,960
to to look at a supplier and say you

1243
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,400
know what have they done

1244
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,960
um to secure their application

1245
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,000
so i i think we're we're doing well

1246
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,880
on

1247
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,520
um you know building our own software we

1248
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,319
know what to do we're not all there yet

1249
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,160
um and i think now it's looking

1250
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,440
externally

1251
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,160
um is is really part of the big future

1252
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,560
of of apsec both on the micro and macro

1253
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,520
level

1254
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,680
um and there's no better

1255
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,839
example of that than the you know

1256
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,319
extremely slow-moving federal government

1257
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,480
getting on board

1258
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,200
with uh president biden's cyber security

1259
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,680
executive order from may

1260
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,680
which is going to hold vendors

1261
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,400
um accountable

1262
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,880
to delivering secure software

1263
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,400
and nist is

1264
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,119
um going down this process um i've been

1265
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,440
taking part in these

1266
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,079
these workshops and call for papers and

1267
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,319
i see a lot of other owasp

1268
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,280
people um taking part in it

1269
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,960
and and it's starting to make progress

1270
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,720
as a definition of critical software is

1271
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,760
released

1272
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,000
on the initial minimum standards for

1273
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,640
supplier is is released

1274
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,520
and

1275
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,160
there's been workshops on iot labeling

1276
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,720
and and software labeling to start to

1277
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,040
make it so that a purchaser of software

1278
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,880
can easily see

1279
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,319
um

1280
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,760
what's been done

1281
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,200
to to secure their software so um i

1282
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,359
think that's that's pretty exciting and

1283
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,680
um it's been quite a journey

1284
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,079
um for application security from

1285
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,960
outsiders to allies and i'm i'm happy to

1286
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,319
be

1287
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,640
just have started as an outsider and and

1288
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,640
now be an ally now and i know a lot of

1289
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,440
you uh out there are

1290
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,559
um so with that i i thank you for

1291
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,760
uh inviting me to to come and speak

1292
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,599
um and i'm happy to be

1293
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,559
be have been part of owass for for for a

1294
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,240
lot of time so

1295
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,599
with that uh i don't know martin um

1296
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,559
i'll turn it back to you

1297
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,640
chris thanks um

1298
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,880
great talk and definitely uh the

1299
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,559
experience you've shared if you have in

1300
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:55,760
your customers definitely we have to

1301
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,000
become allies uh i think it's a weird

1302
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,520
thing for me because i also actually

1303
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,839
have been a developer before i became a

1304
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,760
security specialist i think to see you

1305
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,839
see definitely the difference when you

1306
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,000
approach them many times when i was a

1307
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,839
consultant that people were like

1308
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,680
crossing the arms leaning back like oh

1309
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,119
you're the security guy

1310
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,760
testing my application it's like they're

1311
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,440
expecting you coming with a security

1312
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,599
stick and hitting them just by saying

1313
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:20,960
like no i'm

1314
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,559
what do you expect me to do like you

1315
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,079
your team worked on the software for

1316
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,119
months

1317
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,760
and now i should sprinkle security on it

1318
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,920
so i will be the robot to help you to

1319
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,160
make it more secure and then you get an

1320
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,640
interest and i think it's really bad

1321
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,280
that i find it when people say that uh

1322
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,720
software developer would not be

1323
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,480
interested in security i think the

1324
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,640
software they are the security i would

1325
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,640
like to hear your state the security

1326
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,640
uh industry kind of

1327
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,800
made security unwanted because we said

1328
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,040
it's expensive and complex

1329
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,319
when you have a software project you

1330
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,680
don't want to have anything that costs

1331
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,400
time or money and what do you think is i

1332
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,800
think kind of self-inflicted

1333
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,040
not to be liked by social developers i

1334
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,200
guess

1335
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,240
yeah i i think i think if we had come at

1336
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,240
it right away with

1337
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,760
um

1338
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,440
you know we we

1339
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,119
we don't want to do anything to slow you

1340
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,440
down and speed is more important than

1341
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,400
accuracy

1342
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,400
we'll get better accuracy over time but

1343
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,559
the speed's the more important thing i

1344
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:21,680
think we would have had a better

1345
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,920
audience with the developers i know it

1346
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,920
goes against everything that you believe

1347
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,160
deep down as a security professional

1348
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,400
what do you mean like

1349
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,319
speed over accuracy

1350
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,680
um

1351
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,160
um but you have to start with

1352
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,079
with with where with where someone's

1353
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,839
willing to accept you

1354
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,599
and then you can improve the accuracy

1355
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:42,960
over time

1356
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,119
if you hold to the accuracy

1357
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,119
side of the equation

1358
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,240
um

1359
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,599
you're just kind of you're just kind of

1360
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,280
stuck there so

1361
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,359
um it it's it's it's

1362
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:54,880
it's been a challenge because our

1363
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,480
mindsets are are

1364
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,359
are so different about about what we we

1365
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,280
feel is important

1366
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,599
um but i i think that now we're part of

1367
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,440
the team and we understand what they're

1368
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,200
accountable for

1369
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,839
and and what they feel is important

1370
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,640
now we get some acceptance right we get

1371
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,359
the acceptance first on the team

1372
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,920
and then we can say you know what maybe

1373
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,079
we should be fixing the mediums too and

1374
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,319
not just the highs well how can we do

1375
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,240
that and not slow down well let's figure

1376
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,040
it out let's figure out how to do that

1377
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,520
or let's let's do some more testing with

1378
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,440
multiple techniques to find more high

1379
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,400
issues

1380
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,079
but isn't that going to be more to fix

1381
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,800
no we're going to do it in a way that um

1382
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,400
it's not going to slow down your release

1383
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,440
so i think it's starting it's starting

1384
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,520
wanting to be a peer

1385
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,760
and then bringing bringing in

1386
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,160
and um and and i think that we're making

1387
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,680
a lot more progress now with that kind

1388
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,920
of attitude

1389
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,160
i see that of course teams are becoming

1390
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,319
more agile

1391
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,240
and more flexible and deaf ops and

1392
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,359
pushing left

1393
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,960
but i still see that a lot of security

1394
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,240
departments

1395
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,839
they have struggled to understand what

1396
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,680
devops means it's just oh they want to

1397
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,440
be quick and dirty

1398
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,880
what do you see see we see some

1399
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,960
development in how we can

1400
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,440
see these development and security

1401
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,359
becomes more agile and

1402
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:18,880
what can we do to

1403
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,359
pull them along

1404
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,920
yeah so i i think just if you just look

1405
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,720
at

1406
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,599
you know

1407
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,280
agile and devops as just being faster

1408
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,599
you're you're kind of missing part of

1409
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,440
the of the point and that's sort of a

1410
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,640
shallow

1411
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,800
view of it it really is that that

1412
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,760
continuous process right like seeing a

1413
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,280
manual step

1414
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,440
and and saying hey i can i can automate

1415
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,839
that or seeing something

1416
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,079
an artifact that's not well managed and

1417
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,480
saying hey if i put that in revision

1418
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,680
control

1419
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,599
i can manage it better

1420
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:54,720
so there's

1421
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,520
the part of the devops process is just

1422
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,160
continuous process improvement

1423
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,040
of

1424
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,839
of of you're going faster because you're

1425
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,920
improving your process not because

1426
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,160
you're dropping things on the floor and

1427
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,880
just not doing anything anymore

1428
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,800
so i think once you start to understand

1429
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,920
that

1430
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,680
you start to you start to say well how

1431
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,720
can we get

1432
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,520
how can we get security to fit into that

1433
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,040
um and and and how we can get it to be

1434
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,640
continuous

1435
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,400
and um

1436
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,200
and and something that's fully automated

1437
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,400
and and and doesn't um just it doesn't

1438
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,040
disrupt things right so like disruption

1439
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,079
is bad so how can you plan

1440
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,440
for sort of

1441
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,079
micro man manual tasks

1442
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,599
and and it's it's working with the

1443
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:45,920
development team to figure out how to do

1444
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,920
process improvement

1445
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,319
um not just get faster and i i think the

1446
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,079
process improvement way of thinking

1447
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,359
about it

1448
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:54,480
is

1449
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,559
is um is more real is really what it it

1450
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,720
it's all about it's that it's those

1451
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,000
predictable

1452
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,240
repeatable outcomes

1453
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,559
and and making security

1454
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,280
uh a predictable repeatable repeatable

1455
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,280
outcome and i i think that's the the way

1456
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,720
to think about it and so the longer you

1457
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,880
hang with the devops team

1458
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,839
the more the more you start to get this

1459
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,599
yeah i think it's definitely it's about

1460
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,040
enterprise quality and i think we have

1461
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,040
to realize that i'm just saying that if

1462
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,119
i don't want it yes then maybe your

1463
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,559
message is wrong

1464
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,559
and i don't really understand uh uh

1465
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,800
encourage what you said uh online what

1466
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,880
you said that they're not uh security

1467
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,200
tools i see so many times that security

1468
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,240
department purchases a static code and

1469
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,400
install a dynamic or whatever tool and

1470
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,559
they put it up on the developers or even

1471
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,040
worse they manage it and developers have

1472
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,960
to wait until the security comes with

1473
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,119
the report

1474
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,880
it's so unfortunate that

1475
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,400
maybe we should also not only go to the

1476
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,480
development talk also to compliance

1477
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,599
people and talk there as well

1478
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,760
you know absolutely so it's great to be

1479
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,440
here at olas

1480
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,440
um but i i find when i speak to

1481
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,920
people you know on the development side

1482
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,280
of the world

1483
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,520
i i think it's actually more more

1484
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,440
important because

1485
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,760
when we come into their world we're

1486
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,200
showing them like

1487
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,440
we want to understand your problems we

1488
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,520
want you to understand what we can

1489
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,440
potentially do for you

1490
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,599
and it's coming to sort of their

1491
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,240
their environment i think compliance can

1492
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,079
you know it can it can be the same way i

1493
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,079
know a lot of us have an aversion to

1494
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,440
compliance

1495
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,839
i mean i started as an engineer myself

1496
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,680
so i get along with engineers better

1497
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,599
than i do compliance people

1498
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:40,400
um

1499
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,240
but uh that's another i think that's a

1500
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,640
great point that's another bridge

1501
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,960
that that has to be crossed because it's

1502
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,359
really easy for compliance people to you

1503
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:50,559
know put down

1504
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,880
hard hard lines

1505
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,400
um

1506
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,599
and not try to try to figure out

1507
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,880
how you can you know do both right how

1508
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,799
can you be compliant and be be agile

1509
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,880
um and that you know that's that may be

1510
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,160
even more of a challenge than working

1511
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,040
with the development team

1512
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,000
thank you so much for your time uh thank

1513
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,240
you for being here at our anniversary at

1514
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,160
conference uh

1515
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,280
for everybody

1516
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,839
uh chris will be staying at a

1517
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,119
