00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,760
good morning good afternoon good evening

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,559
to you wherever you are and um welcome

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,240
and thank you for joining our talk today

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,280
about the

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,000
mobile security testing guide so you

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,920
already know us now um myself sven and

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,920
carlos so we are both the project leads

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,480
of the overs msdg project

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,560
and we would like to give you today a

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,480
short update about a project it will not

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,320
be a very technical one

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,559
and just about the project itself and

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,079
what we are thinking about it and the

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,920
future of the project and how we want to

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,960
shape it

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,640
but before we are starting with that i

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,920
want to give you a very brief

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,000
introduction about the masves and also

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,239
the msdg so that we're all on the same

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,600
page so the masves or mobile abstract

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,760
verification standard

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,719
is

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,800
a document that is summarizing roughly i

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,359
think 80 different eight zero different

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,359
security requirements that are

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,280
specifically defined for mobile app

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,159
security so in that sense you can say

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,760
the um miscs is complementing also the

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,720
overs ases project because the asvs is

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,200
more of a server side where the masds is

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,840
really only for the mobile app itself so

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,720
the document is really aimed for giving

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,560
guidance to developers and also

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
penetration testers

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,680
and our goal was also um when we were

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,400
starting the project in 2016 to

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
establish an industry standard for

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,320
mobile security and this mission was

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,040
also achieved because the misvs is

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,240
referenced

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,880
in this in various mobile app payment

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,720
standards in europe and also in other

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,079
countries

45
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,079
um the document itself

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,000
lives in github so we have a repo the

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,600
whole document is being written in

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,799
markdown

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,880
and you can read it also all the time in

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
git gitbook because we changed changed

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
everything to gitbook so meaning every

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,119
change in github will also be reflected

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,960
in kit book

54
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,360
that's about the misvs

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,079
the msdg on the other side is now a much

56
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,399
more comprehensive manual

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,639
for mobile app security testing and even

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,040
reverse engineering so for all the

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,959
different requirements that we have

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,000
outlined in the masbs there are

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,120
different test cases always one

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,680
requirement in the mi sps we'll have one

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,160
test case for ios and one test case for

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,400
android and this has been describing

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,720
really in great detail the technical

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,760
processes that a penetration tester and

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,920
would need to follow in order to verify

68
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,040
the requirement and it also outlines the

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,519
best practices that should be followed

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,519
by a developer to implement the best

71
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,160
practice and to mitigate different kind

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,040
of

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,400
vulnerabilities in mobile apps

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,920
okay so let's come to a few of the

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,720
issues that we could see or are aware of

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,280
as part of the mesds project

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,400
so

78
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,640
the first thing that we was quite

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,200
tedious in the past to be honest was to

80
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,760
create the document so when we were

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,400
doing a release this was a very um

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,239
tedious manual

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,560
process to be honest and therefore

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,440
already last year and we started a new

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,159
initiative in order to create a complete

86
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,440
and improved

87
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,840
document generation pipeline so we were

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,799
shifting now completely to github action

89
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,360
and um this was now a really great team

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
of effort from

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,319
everybody involved in this and the

92
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,680
outcome is really remarkable because we

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,959
are able now to generate all the um

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,680
different mesbs documents

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,599
including all the translations we have

96
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,239
in total i think 12 or 13 different and

97
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,560
translations also and everything is

98
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,920
being

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
generated on the fly in less than

100
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,920
two minutes now

101
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,080
so this is really significant

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,760
improvement for us because this allows

103
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,680
us actually to um

104
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,000
to have more time for for other things

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,799
for the masds and msdg

106
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,879
two other items i would like to point

107
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,360
out is um the checklists that we are

108
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,599
maintaining so we have a checklist which

109
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,439
is an excellent checklist that is

110
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,238
mapping the masvs requirements to the

111
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,959
mstg test cases so this is a quite nice

112
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,120
overview and gives developers but also

113
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
auditors or penetration testers a really

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,759
nice overview and to ensure consistency

115
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,680
when you're also testing the security of

116
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,400
mobile apps

117
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
the other thing is

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
that we are working on is a lack of

119
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,759
consistency

120
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,919
so the lack of consistency means that we

121
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,479
have requirements in the masves that

122
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,040
might be redundant for example we have a

123
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,280
section about authentication the thing

124
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,960
is authentication is happening on the

125
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,919
server side and this is already covered

126
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,560
in the asvs standard so this might be

127
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
something that is redundant and that we

128
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,479
also might want to remove in the future

129
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,560
for example and there are many other

130
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,160
examples where

131
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,639
some controls might be too broad or

132
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,000
where we might want to merge

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,919
requirements or even might get rid of

134
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,000
the requirements and this is also work

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,199
in progress at the moment from our end

136
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,520
so let's go to the checklist generation

137
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,600
um to these two items the checklist

138
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,240
generation and also and the refactoring

139
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,639
for the masves in a bit more detail so

140
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,800
for the checklist generation as i was

141
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
saying it's an excel format

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,560
and the problem that we're facing with

143
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,639
this is that it's usually out of date

144
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,240
because it's maintained manually which

145
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,560
is of course far from ideal we already

146
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
have now this quite nice documentation

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,160
pipeline where everything is happening

148
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,639
in github action and the plan is now to

149
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,800
have um another python script that is

150
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,199
getting the data and that we need for

151
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,080
the excel checklist out of the mstg

152
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,560
markdown files and out of the masves

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,960
markdown files and this will then be

154
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,600
merged into a machine readable format in

155
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,919
an intermediate yaml file so then we

156
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,919
have all the information that we need in

157
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,680
a quite nice format it's machine

158
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,520
readable meaning it could even be

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,759
utilized by other projects like for

160
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,319
example the overs skf the security

161
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,960
knowledge framework and um of course if

162
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,639
you have everything machine readable

163
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,720
then we might even be able to say that

164
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,919
we have full mas m a svs coverage or

165
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,080
maybe some test cases are missing so

166
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
obviously if you have these kind of

167
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,639
machine readable data then you can do um

168
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,759
much much easier um

169
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,400
further automation around it and this

170
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,639
whole initiative that we're doing at the

171
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,840
moment

172
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,240
should be going into a checklist that is

173
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
created automatically

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,479
through and which will also allow us to

175
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,479
have less maintenance for it ideally

176
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,479
this is just being triggered when we are

177
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,280
creating a new release and then the

178
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
checklist is being created automatically

179
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,120
in all the various languages also that

180
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,000
we have available

181
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,800
the other part was about the me svs and

182
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,400
the refactoring

183
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
so you can see here a screenshot of the

184
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,720
mirror board that we are working on at

185
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,759
the moment and this huge mind map that

186
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,160
we already have so i was already saying

187
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,680
it that we have a lot of requirements

188
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,120
that might be redundant redundant or

189
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,360
that are simply might need to be removed

190
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,039
so we are going now through every

191
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,919
different domain in the misvs and also

192
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,000
every different requirement

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,560
and really want to understand if this is

194
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,319
the right requirement if we need to

195
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,720
merge something or move it around

196
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,960
or maybe just need to reword it so this

197
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,720
is of course um

198
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,000
an um

199
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,800
a lengthy process but we want to be very

200
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,120
transparent also about it so what we are

201
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,280
doing at the moment is that we keep

202
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,759
everything um publicly that we have

203
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,000
that we have worked on meaning you can

204
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,560
go into the github discussions of the

205
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,039
masvs

206
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,400
github repo

207
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,560
and the latest discussion is for example

208
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,879
regarding the network requirements so

209
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,639
you can see that the old requirements

210
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,039
our new proposed requirements in terms

211
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,800
of the rewording and what has actually

212
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,840
changed

213
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,000
and we would be very happy if you can

214
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,759
give us some feedback also around it so

215
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,080
that we can really shape everything into

216
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,759
the right manner because only if we have

217
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,879
the masbs in the right way then we will

218
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,280
be able then to create also the um

219
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
updated test cases around it so this is

220
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,960
really the groundwork

221
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,879
that we are doing now to refactor the

222
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,759
whole masves to achieve then

223
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,720
version 2.0

224
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,919
okay

225
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,640
then this was from my end around the

226
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,839
emmy svs then over to you carlos for the

227
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,279
mstg

228
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,799
yeah thank you

229
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,320
so here

230
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,000
let's see about the issues we've

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,720
identified for the msdg

232
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,040
i will just go quickly through all of

233
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,680
them because we have some other slides

234
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,279
with more details

235
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,480
and if

236
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
anything remains open you can just ask

237
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,320
us on the q a

238
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,360
so the first one is very similar as with

239
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,959
the mesps

240
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,519
we were spending a lot of time

241
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,360
very valuable time on the document

242
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,000
generation but now the automation takes

243
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,959
care of that and we are also using uh

244
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,720
almost the same pipeline just a bit

245
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,680
modified for the for the msdg

246
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,959
then

247
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,360
we have uh the second the lack of

248
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,080
usability for testing so

249
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,399
we were thinking about how to make the

250
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,839
guide more more than a static document

251
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,640
so

252
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,519
that um that we can make it functional

253
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,760
usable by other tools people etc so sven

254
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,959
was already talking about the machine

255
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,080
readable documents etc so it goes in

256
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,839
this in this sense

257
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,279
so

258
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,440
on one side we thought about

259
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,760
introducing some rules for static and

260
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,000
dynamic analysis that i will explain on

261
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,200
the next slide

262
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,920
and then um enabling this third party

263
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,279
tool access as it's then also introduced

264
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,040
the third point uh

265
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,279
again lack of consistency and

266
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,000
synchronous sync synchronization with

267
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,519
the mesps

268
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,240
so sometimes we have a test case

269
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,279
covering more than one masbs

270
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,360
ide

271
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,880
so we try to think about what can we do

272
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,519
here and uh

273
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,800
one solution is we decided we will just

274
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,399
go now from having instead of chapters

275
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,440
so one file per one and one file per

276
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,880
test case

277
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,440
equals one mesbhid

278
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,959
and then

279
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,200
all the things about consolidating

280
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,839
information like only having information

281
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,320
about tools in the tools chapter which

282
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,839
makes sense

283
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,320
general chapters should only explain

284
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,600
things about android ios and the testing

285
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,920
chapter should only test because now

286
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,880
it's a

287
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,399
bit mixed

288
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,320
we have a lot of explanations in the

289
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,040
testing chapters as well

290
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,680
and um also we go

291
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
to a

292
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,200
different audience it's not that

293
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,160
different but we were

294
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,320
having us an audience developers and pen

295
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,640
testers and of course we keep the

296
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,839
developers they are welcome here but we

297
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,839
will focus on the

298
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,240
pen testers because it's a testing guide

299
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,720
it's not development guide

300
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,839
so

301
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,480
that for that i will talk about later

302
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,959
again about this point in the slide and

303
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,640
then the

304
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,399
the fourth one uh we'd like to improve

305
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,200
the maintainability so

306
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,399
as you all know maintaining is a pain it

307
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,399
doesn't matter which project it's

308
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,839
documentation here or code or whatever

309
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,279
so um

310
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,399
we noticed that we have a lot of

311
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,560
redundant information or information

312
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,440
that you can actually find online and we

313
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,360
want to kind of ensure that we are

314
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,760
always up to date so maybe

315
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,839
so one of the solutions is to remove

316
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,040
things and link to original sources and

317
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,639
then try to

318
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,279
go with that

319
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,200
so uh

320
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,839
now let's see more about two and three

321
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,560
so

322
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,800
for this rules that i mentioned so

323
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,200
this is just an idea but might actually

324
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
work we will see about this

325
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,519
if you're familiar with our testing

326
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,360
techniques you will

327
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,200
know that we have some static and some

328
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,959
dynamic analysis

329
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,360
techniques so in the end

330
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
we are almost um

331
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,519
always doing the same like on one side

332
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,839
is static we are searching grabbing for

333
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,399
things for a string or something

334
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,360
and on the dynamic part we are traced in

335
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
some function or hooking

336
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,720
this function

337
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,320
uh so

338
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
we thought okay maybe

339
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,040
we can standardize this and we decide

340
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,079
for

341
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,600
static analysis to use grep or sem grab

342
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,440
for code and for

343
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,560
dynamic analysis we always use freedom

344
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,399
so actually we could write rules in some

345
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,440
specific way that is nice to read and

346
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,680
it's also nice to parse

347
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,560
and some other tools can use this and

348
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,880
it's even usable for automation doing

349
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,160
smoke tests from a pipeline etc

350
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,720
so we will come up with something

351
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,600
presented test it and let's see what

352
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,440
happens

353
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,560
so next one

354
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,720
so this is the new architecture i was

355
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,320
talking about so we try to

356
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,040
make clear that everything originates on

357
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,720
the mesvs and as i said before we have

358
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,959
one we will have one file where a mas vs

359
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,920
id including one test case which is

360
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,560
verifying that id and

361
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,399
has always the same structure like

362
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,480
overview static analysis dynamic

363
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,920
analysis

364
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,199
and

365
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,519
then we go to

366
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,480
the test cases making use of the testing

367
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,880
techniques

368
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,519
which will be properly referencing by

369
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,360
links for instance

370
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,160
and these techniques based or are

371
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,760
supported by the testing fundamentals

372
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,240
if you look at our current outlines on

373
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,079
the masd

374
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,320
you will see that testing fundamentals

375
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,560
is called now basic security testing and

376
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,880
testing techniques are actually called

377
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,680
reverse engineering and tampering so we

378
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,480
wanted to make this a bit more

379
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,680
um

380
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,120
generic more so abstracted a little bit

381
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,440
so that this is clear what's in there

382
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,720
and we can properly link

383
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,560
things so and the last step is of course

384
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
testing techniques

385
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,360
um

386
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,839
use tools from the tools chapter and

387
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,480
this will be also properly uh referenced

388
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,279
so

389
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,519
in the end there will be a set of

390
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,320
scripts that um are triggered by our

391
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,480
pipeline and we'll do different things

392
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,440
as

393
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,680
was already mentioned the security

394
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
knowledge

395
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,120
framework we'll get some structural

396
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,959
information from us we will generate the

397
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,440
excel checklists automatically for all

398
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,959
the languages

399
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,320
statistics about coverage and usage of

400
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,000
tools etc

401
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
the static and

402
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
dynamic analysis rules which will live

403
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,800
in the document that will be passed

404
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,160
extracted

405
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,199
and of course our documents like our pdf

406
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,720
and

407
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,920
yeah

408
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,880
so that's it let's see how it works and

409
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,959
we have one more thing

410
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,000
um

411
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,920
kind of uh

412
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,759
a big big thing

413
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,880
we have a lot of changes and um pretty

414
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,480
radical and we're right here so we were

415
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,240
changing a lot over these years

416
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,440
restructuring a lot and we have a lot of

417
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,199
things that we can uh

418
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,240
we wouldn't

419
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,399
would like to do from now on as we are

420
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,839
presenting here

421
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,639
and um this we thought deserve something

422
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,839
big so we took this with the style in

423
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,560
the

424
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,880
instance of these changes and tried to

425
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,360
make a brand new design

426
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,240
so we took our current covers

427
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,399
and turned them into something new

428
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,040
which is this

429
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,800
and um

430
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,519
so we will be introducing this

431
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,440
don't know yet

432
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,000
when exactly but in the next months

433
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,279
probably along with the new changes

434
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,160
and

435
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,839
this should highlight

436
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,839
several things so

437
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,000
the first one

438
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,800
that our two documents are part of the

439
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,199
same entity

440
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,799
the design uh is keep uh skipped clean

441
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,679
and simple consistent and we um

442
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,959
it reflects all of our changes

443
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,119
it also expresses that

444
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,839
we are now more structured and even more

445
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,160
functional as before as we were

446
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,480
explaining and allowing this this

447
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,760
external access and tool access etc

448
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,080
and we also wanted to reflect the

449
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,400
complementarity

450
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,679
because both uh documents um deal with

451
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,640
android and ios even if the msbs is

452
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,360
always agnostic but yeah kind of

453
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,360
reflecting uh what we did for the sg

454
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,000
also for android and ios

455
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,960
and also should be reflected in this

456
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,039
cover redesigned

457
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,200
that we really hope that you also like

458
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,360
as much as we do

459
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,799
and

460
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,720
yeah so that was it from my side uh

461
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,160
any feedback

462
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,440
please reach out on the q a and

463
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,960
also

464
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,840
uh

465
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,039
any time

466
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,160
but emails like on github on our

467
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,080
discussions uh

468
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,679
if you want to participate in the

469
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,960
project uh please anytime just let us

470
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,960
know and we can get you started we have

471
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,039
in our github already how to do that but

472
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,679
in any case you can just contact us and

473
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,640
we will

474
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
gladly help you

475
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,600
so

476
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,400
yeah thanks a lot from my side

477
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,919
and

478
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,320
have a great day and fun with the rest

479
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,200
of the

480
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,200
conference
