[Music]

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,719
um so

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,639
the title of the talk is is is the

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,040
future of devsecops or devsecops

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,760
transformation um so if i want to talk

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,240
about the future

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,320
robert kiyosaki

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,199
kiyosaki says you should study the past

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,279
so i'm going to point to a few things in

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,359
the past that i think will be relevant

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,399
here and help us to forecast the future

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,680
um the first thing i want to sort of

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,440
highlight in the past is agile so um

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,960
the agile movement was a big change in

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,840
the way software development was

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,960
done one of the interesting things about

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
the agile was it broke down silos

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,160
between

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,640
development and qa in particular

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,399
although product was also another silo

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,680
it broke down

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,680
partially

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,600
the way

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,840
you think about it as an agile team

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,239
member is that the agile team then

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,119
became responsible for the owner they

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,400
became ownership of the qa the quality

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,520
of the products they were producing

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,240
and instead of the qa group owning it

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,040
now the development team owns it

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,080
um

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,640
they were not necessarily always worthy

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,119
of this trust i remember getting up on

34
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,040
stage and giving talks at the beginning

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,400
of the agile movement that's that's in

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,640
my background i was an early

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,920
transformation

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,799
consultant for agile transformation

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,560
and i would leave the stage and i would

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,240
go walk out into the hallway and i would

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,479
get flooded by these qa folks

42
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,880
that were like yeah that's a great talk

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,960
and theory that sounds great but it'll

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,840
never work at my organization because of

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,759
blank and they would fill in that blank

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,520
with something that told me they didn't

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,920
trust the development team now back then

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,360
i had a pretty flippant answer that

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,320
you're going to have to trust them

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,000
they're worthy of it already but they

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,680
really weren't worthy of it in a lot of

52
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,680
cases and and if i had to do it over and

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,719
again now

54
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,399
i would use a structure like what i'm

55
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,119
proposing for devsecops that helps them

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,080
to become worthy of it

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,360
um

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
the one thing to note is that it wasn't

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,920
just a a transplant the same things that

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,080
qa people were doing a lot of qa

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,680
departments disappeared with the agile

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
movement and certainly like chief

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,400
quality officer roles

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,200
are almost non-existent today um the

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,280
qa people moved on to the development

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,879
team and some of them left and some of

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,840
them had different skills and etc but

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,200
but in general

69
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,360
developers want to do it differently and

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,959
and in particular they want to do it

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,360
with automation and they want to do it

72
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,440
with different tools and so a perfect

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,239
example of this is is hp's quality

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,560
center hp quality center started

75
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,000
declining in use in sales um soon after

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,599
the agile movement sort of really took

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,319
off and um you know they sold out to

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,599
microfocus and it was renamed to alm

79
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,519
agile lifecycle management quality

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,280
center at some point but that was too

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,680
late it was just they were trying to put

82
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,800
agile lipstick on a traditional qa pig

83
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
and i think we do a lot of that today in

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,840
the devsecops world we put

85
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,120
devops lipstick meaning not real devops

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,680
on a traditional security tool or

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,840
practice or whatever

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,440
and it doesn't really translate well you

89
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,920
have to actually shift left not just

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,040
 left as as my my co-worker now jeff

91
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,640
williams and the founder of oasp says

92
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
yeah you can't just sort of

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,200
transplant the exact same practice over

94
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,799
it's gonna actually morph when it does

95
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,799
that and it was all around culture

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,560
change it was this is about changing

97
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,640
people's mindsets to change their

98
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,799
behavior and you couldn't necessarily

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,120
always lead with a mindset shift you

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,200
sometimes had to like sort of try the

101
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,280
behavior out and that led to the mindset

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,879
shift so it's a little bit of a virtuous

103
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,040
cycle here you gotta get with culture

104
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,280
change going um

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,480
but agile itself didn't really take off

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
until this other thing that i want to

107
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,120
say in our past we should study scrum

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,319
took off

109
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,920
and and so let's talk a little bit about

110
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
some of the elements of scrum that i

111
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,640
think were sort of key to its success

112
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,399
it introduced fundamentally new

113
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,880
terminology and and in some cases the

114
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,639
terms it introduced

115
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,199
look a lot like the terms that existed

116
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,520
before but those older terms for

117
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,680
instance iteration was replaced and

118
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,880
scrum with the phrase sprint

119
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,040
they had different connotations

120
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,680
and they and they had baggage and and

121
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,960
ken schwaber

122
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,000
and jeff sutherland did a really genius

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
job of essentially coming up with terms

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,280
that sort of left the baggage behind and

125
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,840
i think we're stuck words will ossify

126
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,000
old mindsets and and you sort of fall

127
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,560
into oh when someone says this i think

128
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,479
that but now with the new way of working

129
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,040
when someone says this i i need them to

130
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,520
think differently about that and so in

131
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,880
some ways i think we're going to have to

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,600
introduce new terminology to pull it off

133
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,080
they actually had to introduce two new

134
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,560
roles that weren't really in practice i

135
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,160
mean you could say there was project

136
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,680
management but that's very different

137
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,000
than the definition of a product owner

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,360
and a scrum master you could say there

139
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,400
was like a sdlc consultant kind of coach

140
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,639
or whatever but but really the the

141
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,199
definition of the scrum master is is a

142
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,800
fundamental introduction that really

143
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,520
didn't exist before before scrum came

144
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,000
about and they had a simple metrics and

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,919
visualization system the pre-software

146
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,680
engineering the pre-agile software

147
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,880
engineering world had gotten very heavy

148
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
weight with its metrics and it wasn't

149
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,960
very consumable by the average

150
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,360
development team and and scrum greatly

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
simplified that and made made it very

152
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,919
easy to understand your progress and and

153
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,840
where you're going um and i think we're

154
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,440
going to need that for devsecops we

155
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,800
don't have that right now we don't have

156
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,639
simple we have dashboard

157
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,080
overload

158
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,199
um

159
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,120
interestingly enough

160
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,199
scrum actually predates the agile

161
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,680
manifesto it was the prototypes for

162
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
scrum were actually out there in as

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,520
early as 1995

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,720
but scrum itself didn't really take off

165
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,360
um until a few other things happened

166
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,560
they published a a 13 page scrum guide

167
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,039
there's now actually a roughly nine page

168
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,000
of content scrum guide out um so it got

169
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,479
even smaller over the years it got

170
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,560
bigger for a while it got smaller just

171
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,120
in 2020. um that's a great that's the

172
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
best version so far of the scrum guide

173
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,520
for instance and it you know you didn't

174
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,960
need to read a whole book you didn't

175
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,639
need to get a consultant to teach you

176
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,400
you could you could read this scrum

177
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,240
guide and you could always refer back to

178
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
it when you had a question about should

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,360
you do it this way or should you do it

180
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,639
that way and we don't have that in

181
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,000
devsecops

182
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
we have some folks who sort of like

183
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,840
introducing maturity models etc and

184
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,599
there's no real this sort of concrete

185
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,199
sort of small guidance that we're going

186
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,319
to need

187
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,440
and there was an

188
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
ecosystem of certified professionals and

189
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,199
that's starting to evolve but i think

190
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,639
they're focused on the wrong thing i

191
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,479
think they're focused on the particular

192
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,639
devsecops practices and what i think we

193
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,720
need to focus on is actually how do you

194
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
get people to adopt them and so i'm

195
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,639
going to talk about a model where where

196
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,039
we did that the third and last

197
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,639
sort of example from the past i think to

198
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,960
help us predict the future is this idea

199
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,000
of shadow i.t and and so shadow it was

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,960
the early derogatory term because it

201
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,880
took three months to get a new server

202
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,639
when you submitted a request

203
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,880
and shadow it took three clicks to get a

204
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,400
new server a little bit

205
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,360
sort of

206
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,599
way to sort of refer to it but the idea

207
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,080
here was that you know it was not

208
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,520
keeping up with the pace of development

209
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,039
and they had to go around them and

210
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,319
that's exactly what's happening in

211
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,160
security now security is not keeping up

212
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
with the pace of development and they're

213
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
finding ways around them um

214
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,280
the interesting thing and and this isn't

215
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,120
universally true

216
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,000
but

217
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,520
and and the i.t guys denied it for years

218
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,919
after it was mostly true

219
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,000
um the interesting thing is that the

220
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,400
developer way of doing it

221
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,319
for the most part actually it resulted

222
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,720
in higher quality more reliability and

223
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,479
better security and and they did it

224
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,160
without trading off speed in fact they

225
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,440
got gains in speed the old mental model

226
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,599
of you can either have speed or you can

227
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,840
have safety or security or quality or

228
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,400
reliability that's not really true

229
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,879
anymore with devops approaches to things

230
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,080
you actually get

231
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,919
both both go up when you follow the

232
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,360
devops approach

233
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,919
um most a lot of security folks don't

234
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,919
buy that they have trouble with that but

235
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,240
but it really is the message of devops

236
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,519
and and i've seen it really come true

237
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,519
if you do it the right way and just like

238
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,279
you could do

239
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,000
shadow i.t the wrong way and have worse

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,720
security um but if you did it the right

241
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,480
way you actually end up with better

242
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,200
um

243
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,000
scary so now we just refer to shadow i.t

244
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,519
that's an old phrase maybe you've never

245
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,600
even heard of it we just call that cloud

246
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
native because that's sort of the way

247
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,279
developers uh really want to work and

248
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,279
i.t departments sort of had to catch up

249
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,640
and i think that's sort of what's

250
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
starting now with devsecops is the

251
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
security groups are having to catch up

252
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,800
with the mindset and and even if they

253
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,279
can articulate a little bit the mindset

254
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,279
they haven't deeply felt it and they

255
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,320
haven't taken the tough pills like

256
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,880
terminating getting rid of

257
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,200
dissolving moving the people in their qa

258
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
department onto the development teams

259
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,519
they haven't done that in security yet

260
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,040
and and that's the disruption that's

261
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,399
probably coming

262
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,279
here

263
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,360
okay so kawasaki

264
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,640
kiyosaki said um study the past to

265
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,880
predict the future but peter drucker

266
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,560
says the best way to predict the future

267
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,800
is to actually create it so i'm going to

268
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,080
talk about a prototype uh that we that

269
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,480
we used but before i get into that i

270
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,399
want to sort of sort of

271
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,959
give you a foundation in what i mean by

272
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,920
devsecops and and i i said

273
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,839
um it's not just

274
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,440
devops lipstick on a traditional

275
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,080
security pig and and i also mentioned

276
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,160
about scrum being the development team

277
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
taking ownership of quality so i think

278
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,399
of devsecops as really the development

279
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,079
team taking ownership

280
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,320
of security and that's sort of really

281
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
the key of their products and being

282
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,040
worthy of it not just being told you now

283
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,360
have it but not knowing what to do

284
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
um

285
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,320
the interesting thing is i i don't

286
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,760
actually have a separate definition for

287
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,839
devops i sort of have a love hate

288
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,920
relationship because if you're doing

289
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,160
devops right the security is already

290
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,560
baked in and and i find that teams that

291
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,760
are doing true devops have a very short

292
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,839
lift it's very very it's not very

293
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,640
difficult or long lift to sort of up the

294
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,480
game to the level that i'd really like

295
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,200
them to be at um and it's the teams that

296
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,920
are doing traditional apsec

297
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,519
and more sort of pre-devops development

298
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,560
that have a much harder time so i really

299
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,120
think of agile led to

300
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,240
to to devops leads to devsecops if you

301
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,360
try to go straight from agile to

302
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,399
to devsecops it it doesn't actually

303
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,120
result in the the gains of both speed

304
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,000
and quality or relia or reliability or

305
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,880
security when you do that so

306
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,200
um i'm going to talk about the prototype

307
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,440
of of um comcast as uh

308
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,240
the

309
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
the um prototype we're gonna talk about

310
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,839
for for this

311
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,240
this feature um so i spent five years at

312
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,200
comcast i started with just a small just

313
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,480
me and i had a few pilot teams and

314
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,040
and i proved that this approach of

315
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,120
actually trusting development teams with

316
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,320
the security of their own products

317
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,200
worked we showed actually fundamentally

318
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,640
uh huge uh reductions in risk with this

319
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
approach for a much smaller effort

320
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
especially on the security team's budget

321
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,040
um to make it happen and then over the

322
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,880
course of five years i changed my mind a

323
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,959
dozen times i made a lot of mistakes i

324
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,959
learned a ton and i ended up with a

325
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,399
pretty in a pretty good place to the

326
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,560
point where pretty much all of apsec was

327
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,880
being done with the model that i created

328
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,160
and and

329
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,480
um it was all 600 development teams at

330
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,959
comcast covering roughly 10 000 develop

331
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,519
10 000 developers a very flexible

332
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,639
process

333
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,040
not as prescriptive just like scrum is

334
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,519
really flexible but at the same time

335
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,040
it's prescriptive in the ways that it

336
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,959
needs to be is that kind it's that was

337
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,639
that kind of model we ended up with in

338
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,000
the end

339
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,920
i'm going to talk about that here now um

340
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,360
and walk you through it so we did have

341
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,000
to introduce two new roles and the first

342
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,040
of those two roles um was was something

343
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,279
i call a coach and you can call on an

344
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,680
app set coach you can call it a secure

345
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,560
sdlc coach or sdl if you're familiar

346
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,399
with that microsoft term which means

347
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,320
secure development lifecycle not

348
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,800
software development lifecycle

349
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,480
or a devsec ops coach whatever you call

350
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,399
it they're a coach and i really like the

351
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,680
term coach

352
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,160
but interestingly enough i hire scrum

353
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,320
masters to fill this role and and that

354
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,760
that's sort of a

355
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,680
a lot of times people

356
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,519
stall in their transformation because

357
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,200
they can't hire the right skilled people

358
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,120
and they think they need folks that are

359
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
really skilled in security stuff to help

360
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,959
them with the transformation

361
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,639
and those are difficult to find

362
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,880
especially nowadays um but i can

363
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
actually go to a to and find a scrum

364
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,920
master

365
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
around and i can teach them or actually

366
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
the framework that i've packaged up that

367
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,360
they don't actually have to know much

368
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,120
out of the gate to be a good coach they

369
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,880
just have to be used to working with

370
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,440
development teams in a sort of advisory

371
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,760
consulting coaching sort of mode and

372
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,440
then we follow this process that

373
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,279
gradually helps development teams to

374
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,920
improve and um and and i'm going to talk

375
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,639
about the list of practices in a minute

376
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,720
here but um

377
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,160
i i think that's

378
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,360
people over focus on that too early um i

379
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,600
think any decent security group will

380
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,480
come up with a decent list of top end

381
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,320
security practices development they wish

382
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,000
development teams were doing

383
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,399
um i think the tough part is not that

384
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,160
list coming up with that list i think

385
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,920
the tough part is getting people to

386
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,399
actually adopt them in a deepest deep

387
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,720
way not in a checkbox sort of way to

388
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,519
make you go away and satisfy some policy

389
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,360
um and so that's really with the focus

390
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,839
of this framework and i i developed this

391
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,760
call it a maturity model if you will but

392
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,839
i hate that term um

393
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,680
it goes from thoughts to words to

394
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,760
actions to culture thwack is the acronym

395
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,000
for it basically if we don't know the

396
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
status of your adoptions practice it's

397
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
unknown it's this blue color um if if

398
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,079
we've introduced it to you and you're

399
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,000
now thinking about its thoughts if

400
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,920
you've actually made a concrete plan in

401
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,240
the next 90 days to start to adopt it

402
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,639
it's words if you partially adopt it

403
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,160
maybe you're halfway along in that

404
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,839
adoption plan maybe you've got five of

405
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,240
your 10 apps covered maybe you've got

406
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,639
seven of your 27 people trained whatever

407
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,040
it is then that's actions

408
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,079
and then

409
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,680
if you're doing it in every place that

410
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,639
you could possibly do it that's culture

411
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,040
um and so the process that the coach

412
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,839
uses to get people through this

413
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,440
is they sit down with the development

414
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,399
team

415
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,199
um and they're gonna do a partial gap

416
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,839
analysis with their current practices

417
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,839
with this sort of ideal

418
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,880
um 40 practice big huge table but we're

419
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,639
not going to talk about all 40 practices

420
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,880
like an audit would in one shot we're

421
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,920
just going to focus on the t6 ones in

422
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,240
the upper left corner of this table

423
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,880
and um we're going to basically ask the

424
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,920
team

425
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,399
are you doing this and and when they say

426
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,160
yeah we ask them to describe it we have

427
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,360
to have the whole team in the room when

428
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
we do this so we're not going to get

429
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,959
snowed by some team lead that just wants

430
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,639
us to go away

431
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,079
team leads won't lie when their

432
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,160
developers might call them on it so it

433
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,480
creates a sort of a true thing we also

434
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,839
have the business people or the product

435
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,519
owners in the room as well and i'll

436
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,240
explain that why in a minute um

437
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
but we go through these first six top

438
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,959
practices and again i'm intentionally

439
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,720
not telling you what those practices are

440
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,959
yet i will on the next slide

441
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,399
um and if we come up with two to three

442
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,720
two or three that are not at culture we

443
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,880
stop the gap analysis no sense

444
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,800
embarrassing with the other

445
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,639
um there's 40 things in the table the

446
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,440
other the other 34 things in the table

447
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
um let's immediately shift into planning

448
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,839
mode for those six key ones what would

449
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,360
it take for you to adopt it and this is

450
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,279
where you really start to get deep

451
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,680
conversations well we're currently on

452
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,759
this ci platform but we're about to move

453
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,240
to this other ci platform so integrating

454
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,600
this tool doesn't make sense because the

455
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,440
work would need to be duplicated you get

456
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,959
that sort of planning con work going and

457
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,959
you can actually really deeply get them

458
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,639
to sort of internalize what it would

459
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,519
mean what they would have to do in order

460
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,000
to actually adopt a particular a

461
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,759
particular practice and the product

462
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,800
people were in the room the business

463
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,240
people in the room they're seeing this

464
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,480
discussion happen and that that's really

465
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,279
key

466
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,000
at the end of this 90 minute session

467
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,759
we literally go around the room we ask

468
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,399
every individual in the workshop to say

469
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,079
if they support the plan do you support

470
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,920
this plan i need a yes or no a verbal

471
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,600
yes or no like the if you're sitting in

472
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,079
the exit row of an airplane um and i

473
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,680
start with the product people and often

474
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,839
they'll say no the team decided that

475
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,199
they were going to adopt two new

476
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,720
practices turn them one shade of green

477
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,959
darker in the next 90 days and i think

478
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,720
that's too much we have these huge

479
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,119
product things we've got to get out um

480
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,799
and like okay great

481
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,400
that they're hearing you we're going to

482
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
resolve this now um what would we need

483
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,240
to modify about the plan that would make

484
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,439
you happy and almost always they they

485
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,959
they just knock a little bit off of the

486
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,520
plan and everybody's happy then at that

487
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,400
point if you got out of the room with

488
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,919
just the development team and the

489
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,520
product people were not in the room

490
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,799
during the thing

491
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,799
they could essentially

492
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,720
invalidate all of your planning that you

493
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,559
make and this happens a lot when

494
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,559
security folks talk to the

495
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,480
team lead or the developers and the

496
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,559
developers understand how risky that

497
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,400
what they're doing is and they ask the

498
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,679
product people or the business people

499
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,160
for time to work on it they get told no

500
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,559
so this basically gets rid of that

501
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,640
barrier right up front so that we don't

502
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,720
have it and then the coach will

503
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,799
intensely work with that team over the

504
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,120
next 90 days to help them achieve their

505
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
goals that they set in the workshop and

506
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720
then they'll do another workshop maybe

507
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,120
you'll pick off the next twelve six most

508
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,799
important practices and then you'll

509
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,039
eventually get into the sort of uh you

510
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,039
know optional practices that only apply

511
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,640
in certain circumstances

512
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,480
um and over the course of

513
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,000
these 90-day work sessions um you can

514
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,520
you can get teams to very high levels of

515
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,600
maturity in about a year and a half and

516
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
um you know that sounds like a long time

517
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,280
but security groups have been

518
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,360
complaining about developers not doing

519
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
this well for a lot longer than that and

520
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,120
not had a lot of success just

521
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,960
browbeating them into it

522
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,440
um this actually is a way a path a

523
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,760
shallow on-ramp to actually get them to

524
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,440
do it and this is essentially the heart

525
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,120
of the whole the whole

526
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,960
framework this is what it looks like

527
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,559
when they're they're done and there's

528
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,799
the list of practices um this is a tool

529
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,400
called greenhouse that i led the

530
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,320
development of that comcast and i'm

531
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
currently working on an open source

532
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,080
version of um you click on one of this

533
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,240
and it has a description of the practice

534
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,400
um by the way i'm not going to hard code

535
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,919
the practices they aren't hard-coded

536
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,080
into greenhouse

537
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,320
comcast either they're all textual

538
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
editing and every organization will be

539
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,080
able to create their own sort of list of

540
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,760
formulation of practices

541
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,880
like this

542
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,120
second key role we need to introduce in

543
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,080
order to pull this off

544
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,039
is

545
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,760
is the pipeline engineering team and i

546
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,679
say pipeline engineering team

547
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,559
but

548
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,480
um

549
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,720
i i don't want to hire people that would

550
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,200
actually label themselves as ops

551
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,039
engineers or

552
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,440
new literally calling themselves devops

553
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,720
engineers

554
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,880
i really want true developers i want

555
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,400
folks that are writing code on friday

556
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,880
and they start a new job working in for

557
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
me on monday

558
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,640
in this pipeline engineering role and

559
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,440
they continue to write code in this role

560
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,679
and i don't just mean scripts and stuff

561
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,520
i mean they are writing apps that

562
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,200
greenhouse app was built by this

563
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,000
pipeline engineering pool of folks that

564
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,919
i had at comcast i ended up with you

565
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,720
know roughly you know uh you know five

566
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,000
to ten um pipeline engineers and and in

567
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
any given quarter one or two or three of

568
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,159
them were working on heads down just on

569
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,559
application or tooling development um

570
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,480
the beauty of this

571
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,880
is that is that they really are still

572
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,280
relevant development skills and they can

573
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,440
keep talking to development teams and

574
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
they have credibility when they talk to

575
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,520
them they'll also do it in an automated

576
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,400
way

577
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,520
so a typical security pipeline engineer

578
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,159
at a large organization is probably only

579
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,440
comfortable configuring in a ui the

580
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,000
plugins for jenkins these are folks that

581
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,919
could write the jenkins plug-ins and we

582
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,159
did a lot of that kind of work at

583
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,039
comcast and that's the sort of level of

584
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,880
do it like a developer would do it i

585
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,120
really want the other sort of

586
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,840
and this is this was actually huge value

587
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,480
but it was it was always underrated by

588
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,960
my bosses at comcast but these folks

589
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,600
were dog fooding the very practices the

590
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,039
very framework we were trying to get

591
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,880
other development teams to use remember

592
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,320
they're a development team they built a

593
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,640
really huge app actually over the course

594
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,280
of five years at comcast this team

595
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,760
and they were using all of the tools and

596
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,360
all of the practices they were dog

597
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,000
fooding everything if an if a group

598
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
inside a comcast came to me and said we

599
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,280
bought this new tool and we want you

600
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,640
because you talked to all the developers

601
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,000
with these coaching sessions we want you

602
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,919
to start to introduce them to it i'd be

603
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,360
like well first

604
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,080
our team needs to start using it and you

605
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,600
don't know how many times i stopped

606
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
false false starts prevented false

607
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,360
starts from happening things where you

608
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,880
try to roll it out and it's just not

609
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,280
quite ready to be rolled out and and i

610
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
prevented that from actually

611
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,120
interfering with the rollout

612
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,440
um joseph went on video there is there

613
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,600
something you needed to say joseph or no

614
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,880
you're going off video so i think that

615
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,080
was a mistake

616
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,960
um

617
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,679
next key element of the prototype is is

618
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,200
that um

619
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,640
we

620
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,320
uh

621
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,400
want to plug in this became a sort of a

622
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,280
hard and fast rule for the team um we

623
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,679
want you to think of security as an

624
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,960
attribute of quality so in order for

625
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,760
that to be true we want the feedback for

626
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,159
security bugs a vulnerability is just a

627
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,000
particular kind of bug right

628
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,559
we want that to to be detected in the

629
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,360
same spot in your sdlc and fed back to

630
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,600
the same spot in your sdlc and if you

631
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,559
use automated testing it's typically not

632
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,320
going into a jira ticket a lot of

633
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
devsecops tool vendors and a lot of

634
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,880
devsecops leaders inside of enterprises

635
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,559
celebrate the fact that we can now put

636
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,720
the vulnerabilities into the jira for

637
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,559
the team and that's now in their

638
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,400
workflow and that's better than what

639
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,600
they were doing before which was

640
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,840
emailing them a spreadsheet of the list

641
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,679
of vulnerabilities um but but if if it

642
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,120
fed back in the pull request or in the

643
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,559
pipeline

644
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,360
that's much more likely to get to get

645
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,440
responded to and that's if the team is

646
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,679
mature enough to get quality feedback in

647
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,919
that place then that's where it should

648
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,919
you never have to create a ticket you

649
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,240
never get that overhead of that

650
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,320
happening and so that is actually a huge

651
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,880
savings it feels lighter weight it goes

652
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,720
faster and and so the pull request is

653
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,400
the ideal place for that and the reason

654
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,320
for that is the developer is essentially

655
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,039
in love with the code or she wrote this

656
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,280
morning they want nothing more than

657
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
their peers their friends

658
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,320
to say how you know wonderful this new

659
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,960
heartthrob of theirs is and if you

660
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,559
resurface

661
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,520
uh the red x that would block the merge

662
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,640
button

663
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,320
um in a pull request then um they will

664
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,559
look at that red x and before the

665
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,400
reviewer looks at it and they will

666
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,480
resolve whatever it says because they

667
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,240
don't want to be embarrassed by that red

668
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,760
x in front of their

669
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,799
in front of their peers um by the way i

670
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,400
don't think we went over this before we

671
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,520
got going and i don't have the chat up

672
00:23:59,520 --> 00:23:59,850
um

673
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,600
[Music]

674
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,440
okay looks good here so but we're going

675
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,840
to do q a on the slack channel so

676
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,279
hopefully you guys have access to that

677
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,039
now at the end of this talk i actually

678
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,960
have a slide where you will get access

679
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,120
to it if you don't right now

680
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,200
there's a link to it i'll have it up on

681
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,679
screen you can type it in

682
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,919
so the developer will jump through hoops

683
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,080
and and and and this is very different

684
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
than if you put a jira ticket and it's

685
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,679
three weeks later that they get that and

686
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,039
that's on the work they did three weeks

687
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,159
they already moved on to a new

688
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,600
heartthrob that's the code they wrote

689
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,679
this morning and not the code they wrote

690
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,760
three weeks ago and the jira ticket way

691
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,600
is is typically in that sort of three

692
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,840
week range it has to get scheduled into

693
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,840
another sprint at best case or if it

694
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,279
doesn't get scheduled to the very next

695
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,279
sprint is typically longer than three

696
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,039
weeks before and could be much longer

697
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,360
than three weeks um and and they were

698
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
less familiar with the code and the

699
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,960
learning is so much harder because they

700
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,120
have to go back and it just does it

701
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,279
misses the boat on a lot of things if

702
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,640
you do it um

703
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,240
in the jira ticket way

704
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,799
key prototype element number eight

705
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,880
um is around this sort of learning

706
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,360
effect basically the learning effect is

707
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,960
a hundred times more powerful than the

708
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,200
find and fix effect and and the idea

709
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,799
here is that when you when something is

710
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,159
found by a tool or an incident occurs in

711
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,520
production or

712
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,760
a security incident or a reliability

713
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,559
incident whatever it is there's a um a

714
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,240
finding from

715
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,559
a pen test or something

716
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,799
the normal thing to do is treat that

717
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,360
like a check list and you want to fix

718
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,919
those things that were absolutely found

719
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,159
i i say that you want to turn that thing

720
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,919
that was found into a pattern

721
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,679
and you want to look for that pattern

722
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,360
elsewhere even if it wasn't found by

723
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
this check you want to see if it's

724
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,039
anywhere else in this code base than any

725
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,720
other code base so that's 10x more

726
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,200
effective if you just do that and then

727
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,559
you want to put in place something that

728
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,520
prevents you from ever doing this again

729
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,880
and this doesn't just apply to this

730
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,720
project it applies to every project that

731
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,120
developer is on forevermore now there is

732
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,600
a half-life to learning but assuming

733
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,960
they keep current with it they're

734
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,520
they're they're going to actually write

735
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,080
much much fewer vulnerabilities in the

736
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,240
future and this essentially flattened

737
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,440
the findings curve to near zero slope um

738
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
when we saw this finding if that kicked

739
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,600
in and it was incredibly so much more

740
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,039
powerful because you know if you don't

741
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,400
write it in the first place there's no

742
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,720
work to track it or find it or get rid

743
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,440
of it or whatever so imagine how much

744
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,600
more effective that is so if you want to

745
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,880
focus on this

746
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,960
there's this this concept of contextual

747
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,559
learning and you can find the wikipedia

748
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,720
page on it um and it talks about these

749
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,480
three aspects of contextual learning

750
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,559
situated social and distributed and when

751
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,760
all three of these factors are true when

752
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,880
um

753
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,919
your

754
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,919
when the when the work

755
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,000
the learning is actually something you

756
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,080
need to accomplish in order to get the

757
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,320
current work done so let's say there was

758
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,000
a finding that shows up in the pull

759
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,600
request and the developer wants it to

760
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,799
get approved

761
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,080
but knows it won't get approved with

762
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,640
that vulnerability in it but there was a

763
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
click a link they could click on they

764
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,400
took them to a two-minute video that

765
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,559
that just showed them that one

766
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,120
particular what a sql injection is a two

767
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,279
or three minute video then they're gonna

768
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,440
listen and pay close attention to that

769
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,919
exercise so that they actually learn how

770
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,520
to get rid of sql injection

771
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,840
vulnerabilities and and uh so it's it's

772
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,000
powerful if you do it in that mode by

773
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,840
the way um you know i don't work for

774
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,120
secure code warrior but i know they're

775
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,159
speaking here um i i i've spoken for

776
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,640
them before in webinars and stuff and

777
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,559
they do this they integrate with lots of

778
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,320
tools

779
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,159
the company i work for contrast now

780
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,320
happens to be one of those tools but um

781
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,159
you can you can do this and and they

782
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,760
give you this sort of just-in-time

783
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,559
contextual learning um code bashing is

784
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,120
an other alternative check marks that um

785
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,360
i think also does a pretty good job of

786
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,840
this uh if if you're using tools that it

787
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,120
integrates with

788
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,760
um it has to be social meaning it has to

789
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,080
give you credibility with that social

790
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,559
group and if you think about the stem

791
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,600
learning

792
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,240
fallacy for women i think it's really

793
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,399
falls down on this on this social thing

794
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,080
and they have the aptitude that it's

795
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,840
just it they don't have the social

796
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,440
motivation and it has to be reinforced

797
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,039
by the organization

798
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,760
um so the last section here i have is on

799
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,840
metrics and i don't i don't really have

800
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,360
time to go through the details of the

801
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,919
next four slides um but there's actually

802
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,080
another talk i'll reference you to that

803
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,000
actually goes into depth on the content

804
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,240
of this um at the end here but but just

805
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,720
for a minute here i wanted to talk about

806
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,240
about metrics and this is the last

807
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,000
section before i

808
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,600
wrap up here

809
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,520
i use metrics for three purposes

810
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,320
primarily and i spent a huge amount of

811
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,960
our my budget my energy my resources on

812
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,360
building robust metrics frameworks to do

813
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
this and i think security groups are

814
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,000
under investing by a huge margin in this

815
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,399
very important aspect but first of all i

816
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,000
used it to gain sponsorship i showed

817
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,559
that 85 reduction in risk that got me

818
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,240
the next round of budget for the next

819
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,559
year and and not only that but it also

820
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,159
got the executives to say you should

821
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,159
onboard to larry's program

822
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,480
um i used it to work and coach with

823
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,720
individuals on teams got i gamified the

824
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,360
data i had a leaderboard i had i had

825
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,399
sort of like

826
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,360
celebrated successful accomplishments um

827
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,600
that sort of thing with the metrics um

828
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,039
and then i also used it to tweak the

829
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,919
program and the talk i gave at rsa

830
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,760
conference sort of goes over some of the

831
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,520
major things we found that were wrong

832
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,200
with the program that we wouldn't have

833
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
known were wrong if we hadn't analyzed

834
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,399
it with data

835
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,919
so these slides are the sort of the

836
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,360
details of that

837
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,600
this is the list of practices that

838
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,320
prove to be to be worth it and then this

839
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,399
last section here is what else is needed

840
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,159
um we need a 10-page guide like the

841
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,880
scrum guide we need those certifications

842
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,480
for professionals to go out there and

843
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,880
help folks do it like scrum has um and

844
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,480
we need a tool like the one i led at

845
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,919
greenhouse and then i'm building open

846
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,399
source for in order to pull this off and

847
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,880
that will lead to an ecosystem um for

848
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,120
