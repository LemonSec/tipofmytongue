00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,080
well hello world good morning good

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,240
afternoon good evening

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,639
uh you tuning in from

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,039
wherever you are uh

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,960
it's a pleasure to be here

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,880
and we'd like to thank you for tuning in

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,800
to the future is simple

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,039
where we're going to launch the series

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,920
something that we are very excited about

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,599
it's something that we feel we have in

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,039
store for you

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,399
and

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,640
before we go into what the siri actually

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,079
is

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,399
sneak preview it is for successfully

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,360
using and providing security standards

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,920
we like to go into what problem we want

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,280
to solve with the cre

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,320
security is not simple that's actually

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,000
the problem that we

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,440
that we are providing a solution for

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,960
if you look at the report of the

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,120
european cyber security organization

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,199
from 2018

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,440
this is sort of a zoomed out version of

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,479
it you can see it has 200 pages of cyber

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,080
security standards

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
standards that overlap standards that

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,400
have gaps standards that have different

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,520
focus

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,680
and the conclusion from that report and

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
that's also the consensus

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,320
it's fragmented this standard landscape

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,040
it's complex it's confusing so if you're

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,280
an engineer or a tester or if you want a

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,320
procure software it's hard to select and

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,479
find appropriate information in these

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,600
standards

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,680
and for standard makers it's it's

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,000
practically impossible to link to other

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,040
relevant work and keep that up to date

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,360
and the result is that standards tend to

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,000
cover everything instead of focusing on

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,720
their added value and linked to other

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,600
work

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,399
and this creates unnecessary effort and

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,360
the risk of inconsistencies and

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,159
incompleteness

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,439
one of the issues that we see a lot is

51
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,439
somebody wrote a standard is either for

52
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,080
a country or a specific industry or a

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,399
specific industry in a country or a

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,480
specific sort of device

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,560
and they link to other resources it's a

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,680
good idea

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,360
but these resources change they get

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,760
newer versions they get moved they get

59
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
cancelled even

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,599
and people click on it and they get a

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,360
404 error

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,720
this is not good spiros

63
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,679
earth calling spiros

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,760
we are not getting your sound

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,040
can you hear me now

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,560
yes yes

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,280
awesome sorry for that so the same

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,800
mistake happens

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,879
even with the wasp

70
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,920
we have

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,239
a lot of projects a lot of standards a

72
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,920
lot of documentation

73
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,040
which

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,800
is not

75
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,680
together in one

76
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,720
unified way um as a start for this

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,840
project we sat down and tried to map

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,920
all over all of us projects of a certain

79
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,959
level onto an sdlc we called it the

80
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,319
application uh wayfinder and you can

81
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,640
find it online it's on our wash wiki

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,599
page

83
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,599
but even that

84
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,319
we had a lot of trouble digging through

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,640
links or just

86
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,760
linking between things

87
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,560
rogue back to you yes

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,440
and this problem was also identified by

89
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,799
inisa

90
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,200
this initial report advancing software

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,400
security in the eu

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,920
says that requirements largely overlap

93
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,760
and this demonstrates that software

94
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,239
security is mainly a generic problem

95
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,920
that both standards developing

96
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
organizations

97
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,439
and standards organizations or good

98
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,680
practice producers they're often working

99
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,760
without proper coordination and

100
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,439
effective liaisons and one of the

101
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,319
recommendations in this report

102
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,200
is

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,519
uh develop a common repository for

104
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,959
shared security measures spoiler this is

105
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,320
the theory

106
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,880
and the goal is to align on requirement

107
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,520
commonalities across different schemes

108
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,360
across different scanners

109
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,000
so that you can prevent proliferation

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,800
and fragmentation while also making

111
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,960
drafting and maintaining a scheme

112
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,919
more efficient in terms of mitigating

113
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,440
the risk

114
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,160
and we set out to try and solve this to

115
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,919
create this

116
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,719
repository

117
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,800
let's look at it

118
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,639
security standards and guidelines they

119
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,120
are connect connected really at the

120
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,680
requirement level so if for example you

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,520
have an entry in the owasp asvs it's a

122
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
large list of

123
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,840
security verification checks

124
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,919
and here's a specific one 402 it says

125
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,840
verify that regulated private data is

126
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,600
stored encrypted

127
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
well you can find more information about

128
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,919
encryption in this nist publication 53

129
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,479
and also more information about personal

130
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,440
data

131
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,880
and in the os web service testing guide

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,840
you can find more information on how to

133
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,280
test this

134
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,720
if we could somehow connect everything

135
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,120
things would become easier to find

136
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,440
clearer more consistent

137
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,880
and more complete

138
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,160
but how

139
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,479
so we looked into this problem

140
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,240
and we saw

141
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,479
one major problem to start with and

142
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,560
everybody runs into this so mapping

143
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720
everything to everything is too much

144
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,280
work and unmaintainable we have here

145
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,680
four standards an ep map everything

146
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,160
that's related to everything else

147
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,919
it's just way too much work and this is

148
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,400
just for four standards imagine if you

149
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,400
want to do this for for a 4.20

150
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,800
and demonstration of this is an

151
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,280
initiative of iot security mapping dot

152
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,240
uk

153
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,560
they mapped iot security standards from

154
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,039
about a hundred sources and the result

155
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,440
is a gigantic graph

156
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,720
a thousand pages of json specification

157
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,800
quite a useful effort it provides a lot

158
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,680
of

159
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,160
insight at that moment but extremely

160
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,400
hard to maintain once that

161
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,120
one of these standards gets updated

162
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,520
maybe the the entries get shuffled

163
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,960
around

164
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,199
suddenly it's out of date and you need

165
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,720
to update it so imagine doing this for

166
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,759
all security topics

167
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,360
so we thought about this

168
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,639
and we came up with a solution

169
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,199
why not link to

170
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,880
shared topics

171
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,240
instead of linking to all the other

172
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,280
standards you link to topics that you

173
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,800
share

174
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,440
and by doing so if the msvs links to

175
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
this topic

176
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,759
and the kpac links this entry to the

177
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,960
same topic

178
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,680
they are basically interrelated

179
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,080
but they don't have to specify this so

180
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
this makes linking

181
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,400
a lot easier than having to link to all

182
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,479
these these different resources

183
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,520
this is an example so we have here the

184
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,560
four standards we have specific entries

185
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,240
of these standards

186
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,039
they

187
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,400
have links

188
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,680
read more

189
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,000
and they link to

190
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,520
this topic session token generation

191
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,319
and you may notice that this topic has

192
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,120
a six digit number this is what we call

193
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
the cre id so the cre contains many

194
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,280
topics that are interrelated and every

195
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,199
topic has a unique

196
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,840
six digit number and if you link to that

197
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,560
number you link to that topic more on

198
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,879
that later

199
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,800
there's another problem

200
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,879
if you've made a standard

201
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,759
and you want to link to topics

202
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,440
there is

203
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
a large set of topics

204
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,440
and especially if you look at it from

205
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,400
the granularity at the detail level

206
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,800
that you see in the asvs it's just an

207
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
enormous list of hundreds

208
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,160
of topics and standards may not really

209
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,599
have a lot of fun going through all

210
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,599
these topics and see how they link and

211
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,760
in many cases standards

212
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,719
are

213
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,320
about more higher level topics such as

214
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,479
personal data or

215
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,640
cryptography or

216
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,200
specific aspects that are at a higher

217
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,240
level

218
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,000
so instead of

219
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
having to go through all these detailed

220
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,279
topics we

221
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,839
introduce higher level topics such as

222
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,640
cryptography making it much easier for

223
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
standards to link to those

224
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,800
and by doing so they indirectly link to

225
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,600
the detailed topics because those have

226
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
relations with those higher level topics

227
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,519
for which we have an example here that

228
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,880
is uh that spirus will uh

229
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,279
discuss

230
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,839
thank you rob

231
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,200
so as an example um say that you have

232
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,279
asvs 611 encrypt regulated personal data

233
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,320
rest

234
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,640
which links to the topic and create

235
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,040
personal data at rest which

236
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
is pretty intuitive

237
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,480
that topic

238
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,800
by itself links to

239
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,440
two other cres um two

240
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,760
two seven five four eight three security

241
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,560
store regulated data and personal data

242
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,480
handling which

243
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,160
again is pretty

244
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,480
intuitive makes sense personal data

245
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
handling can link to

246
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,920
the relevant

247
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,640
nist version in this topic

248
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,760
and

249
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,160
also securely storage related data can

250
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,959
link to the encrypt data addressed cre

251
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:09,920
because

252
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,480
you would need encryption at some point

253
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,320
if you want to securely store regulated

254
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,680
data

255
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,240
and cre 504 340 encrypt data test links

256
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,640
to cwue 311

257
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,279
missing encryption of sensitive data

258
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,480
which

259
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,560
again is

260
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,839
a relevant

261
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
standard as well if you want to encrypt

262
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,680
data address at some point you will need

263
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,519
some cryptography which makes sense so

264
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,279
that should link to

265
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,000
the cryptography screen which is linked

266
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,680
to

267
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,480
a couple of nice topics

268
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,279
and

269
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,040
about cryptography and um web security

270
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,600
testing guide bio was

271
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,560
on how to test for weak encryption

272
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,440
and you see by just following the path

273
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,079
from asvs 611 you have

274
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,640
the link to both nist uh wsdg cwe

275
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,320
and nic

276
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,560
and a whole host of other cities

277
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,079
thanks pierce

278
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:20,800
so

279
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,120
why are we doing this why

280
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,320
are we

281
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,040
aiming to make this more simple well

282
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,959
there's so many resources and you all

283
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,720
need them when you're building software

284
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,560
when you're procuring software

285
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,720
you need to inform the testers you need

286
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,360
to involve auditors and they all need to

287
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,800
know different sides of the story

288
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
and this is important because software

289
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,279
is getting more important

290
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,079
and application security is

291
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,839
getting more complex it's not getting

292
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,440
any easier

293
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,720
and we've

294
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,279
we've come a long way right if you look

295
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,920
at frameworks for example how much they

296
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,720
take care of security for us nowadays

297
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,959
but still there's a lot of remains that

298
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,839
we need to comprehend and understand and

299
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,320
have available as as knowledge while we

300
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,639
do our work and

301
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,959
i'm not only referring to doing this for

302
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,519
experts to make their work easier

303
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,720
i'm actually mainly referring to the

304
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,560
non-security superheroes

305
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,480
that really require security to be more

306
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,720
simple for them to use it

307
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,760
effectively to use standards effectively

308
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,639
and uh the shortage of security super

309
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,519
heroes is not going away

310
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,480
and by making things more simple and

311
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,800
uniting these standards that's what we

312
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,360
basically are doing with this theory

313
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
we want to reach a larger group of

314
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,680
people who can join in on the security

315
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,680
fund

316
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,399
there's

317
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,639
one more problem that we needed to fix

318
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,959
it is the problem that

319
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,560
uh as said standards change they change

320
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,680
location

321
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,360
they change structure

322
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,040
so if you have these this mapping

323
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,360
to the topics and higher level topics

324
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,639
and it's working

325
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,360
then at some point standard changes

326
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
and it's not working anymore

327
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
the solution we came up with

328
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,240
is that

329
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,839
we require

330
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,399
the links to the cre so the links to the

331
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,360
topics to be placed in the standards

332
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,560
itself

333
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,120
so let's say the os testing guide has a

334
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,079
link to this specific topic in this

335
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,519
theory

336
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,760
through

337
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,360
an anchor a hyperlink in html or

338
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,160
whatever it's in the source because you

339
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,600
link to the cre which is actually a web

340
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,760
page and we'll shortly demonstrate it

341
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,839
by having that id

342
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,040
in the original text we can parse it

343
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,120
and it's machine readable right so we

344
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,440
can pause it and we know that this

345
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,600
specific topic in testing guide is

346
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
related to this topic

347
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,600
and at the moment that this changes

348
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,120
location

349
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,040
we just need to parse it again

350
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,199
and the mapping will be automatically up

351
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,199
to date so in its most simplest form

352
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,519
the cre system that we build

353
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,160
is actually a hyperlink system a central

354
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,920
hyperlink system

355
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,199
where the links to the different

356
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,760
standards will always remain up to date

357
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,800
because the stands actually refer

358
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,479
themselves to the links

359
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,040
so the cre what did we do we assembled a

360
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,199
group of people

361
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,360
and we became part of the integration

362
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,480
standards project at uh owasp

363
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,160
with spiroz and me uh and elisad as

364
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,199
co-leads and a lot of other people

365
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,320
joining in

366
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,120
on the fun uh including standard makers

367
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,800
we have workshops with them

368
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,560
security professionals to understand

369
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
their issues

370
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,399
then we designed the linking mechanism

371
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,959
basically the procedure that we took you

372
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,199
through with these these three

373
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,240
big problems that we needed to solve

374
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,959
and we created a mapping a mapping

375
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,639
between the acvs

376
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,720
the os top 10

377
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,600
the nyx nist 63 and nist 853

378
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,560
proactive controls i was cheat sheets

379
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,920
the testing guide the cwe and i'd like

380
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,880
to give

381
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
strong kudos to the asvas team and the

382
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,519
skf team who've really helped them

383
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,839
supported data and information to make

384
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,120
this mapping

385
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,480
happen

386
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,199
the biggest work of the mapping was to

387
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,160
construct the topic tree the topic tree

388
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,480
that you need for standards to connect

389
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,440
to

390
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,519
and it actually emerged as sort of a

391
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,880
consensus from all these standards uh

392
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
and it's it's not a strange thing that

393
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,560
there's a consensus because all these

394
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,279
standards talk about the same thing in

395
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,800
in the core

396
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,399
and we use the iso 25010 security model

397
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,720
from software improvement group which is

398
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,360
also based on research of how can you

399
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,680
make a uniform model of security

400
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,519
standards

401
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,839
we work with openssf we work with the

402
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,440
top 10 team

403
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,399
the dutch cip is also interested as a

404
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,120
standard maker to see how they can embed

405
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,160
it

406
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,199
and

407
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,199
we built the siri application which

408
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,680
we're going to demo today

409
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,399
and on the landing page of that website

410
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,120
opensiri.org

411
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,240
we define it as follows siri is an

412
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,440
interactive content linking platform for

413
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,279
uniting security standards and

414
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,079
guidelines it offers easy and robust

415
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,320
access to relevant information when

416
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,399
designing developing testing and

417
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,519
procuring

418
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,759
secure software

419
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,279
that's what siri

420
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,079
is

421
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,360
and

422
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,680
ladies and gentlemen

423
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,720
now it's time for the official launch

424
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,160
with the lack of smashing uh

425
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,720
champagne bottles or confetti we need to

426
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,640
do it digitally

427
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,799
it's going to be like this

428
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,400
and

429
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,839
five four three two

430
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,199
one years of work here we go it's

431
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,119
launched this is a screenshot

432
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,559
spheros will

433
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,320
shortly uh demonstrate it so the floor

434
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,280
is yours man

435
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,919
thank you thank you very much

436
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,679
so

437
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,960
we were

438
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,799
talking with rob the other day about

439
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,320
user journeys that we would like to

440
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,720
present

441
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,120
using my screen and

442
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,960
one of the simple topic and one of the

443
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,280
simple user journeys is let's start from

444
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,799
screen

445
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,799
we talked about encrypting personal data

446
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,960
test and this is the relevant cre

447
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,760
and

448
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,000
as a stakeholder

449
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,120
say a security manager in a company

450
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,240
you

451
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,160
by just viewing this page you have

452
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,640
access to a lot of information you can

453
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,840
link to the relevant asps you can link

454
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,559
to the testing guide which you can send

455
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,120
to your testers on how

456
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,799
instructing them how to test for this

457
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,520
thing

458
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,840
similar for

459
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,600
cwe you can use the cheat sheets to send

460
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,320
to relevant developers who are gonna

461
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,919
maybe fix it

462
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,760
and

463
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,320
you know things things like that which

464
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,200
is great but it doesn't stop there

465
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,360
because that would be just one level

466
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,720
if you want to

467
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,559
protect personal data at rest you at

468
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,640
some point you need cryptography and

469
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
cryptography

470
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,000
links to

471
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,559
a list of nist but if i also click on

472
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,320
the cryptographicity

473
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,559
i get everything that is linked to

474
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,919
cryptography so i understand how to use

475
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,000
cryptography in a better way

476
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,799
and i know that if i somehow have tested

477
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,679
for encrypting personal data test

478
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,600
then i have tested

479
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,080
implicitly a part of cryptography as

480
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,400
well and then i have

481
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,320
all of these relations between

482
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,440
cryptography and the rest of the tree

483
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,480
which is

484
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,400
great and also

485
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,000
as an extra i can learn about personal

486
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,799
data handling for example right which is

487
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,640
should be somewhere down here

488
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,280
i'll find it

489
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,760
from a piston but i learned about

490
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,880
a lot of cryptography like topics which

491
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,440
is important for example

492
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,760
using secure random to generate initial

493
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
authentication codes

494
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,600
right which

495
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,080
a lot of companies fall for but if i

496
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,200
want to protect personal data

497
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,120
this is something that i might have to

498
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,360
do and in one

499
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,600
little

500
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,720
cre i get links to both of the hbs for

501
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,280
my con to all of the svs for my controls

502
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
cwe for

503
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,400
a lot more

504
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,960
extended information and then teach it

505
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,679
on how to maybe protect about it uh

506
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,240
protect against it and make it right

507
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,640
and that kind of makes sense

508
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,600
also

509
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,000
as an extra this is not just this

510
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,840
this is not just

511
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,000
starting from a cre perhaps i want to

512
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,880
start from a logical topic so i can

513
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,159
search for session give me everything

514
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,280
that there is

515
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,919
to know about session handling and

516
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,240
here's a ton of cres

517
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,200
on

518
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,840
session management and session handling

519
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
for example

520
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,320
terminate session after lookout right

521
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,600
and here's all the related standards uh

522
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,799
concurrent session control from nist uh

523
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,919
testing guide session 06 uh relevant

524
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,520
sheet sheets

525
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,559
and

526
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,559
just by

527
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,440
typing in a topic a logical topic almost

528
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,559
like a metadata i have access to all

529
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,240
this information which i can then

530
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,480
disseminate to different people in my

531
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,960
organization

532
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,000
but

533
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,240
it doesn't end there there is a final

534
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,000
demo you don't usually get three demos

535
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,919
in uh in one talk now do you

536
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,400
say i'm a standards writer and

537
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,760
i need to go in like i write the svs if

538
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,600
asps in its data classification

539
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,640
section had the link to crm

540
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,600
it could just add the hyperlink and then

541
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,080
by clicking on it you go back to encrypt

542
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,159
personal data test

543
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,280
and you can easily

544
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,360
traverse the tree as we saw earlier

545
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,799
all of that via simple hyperlinks

546
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,559
rob would you like to chime in

547
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,840
yes

548
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,679
thanks man

549
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,280
no worries

550
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,039
uh

551
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,200
if i can share my screen

552
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,440
sure

553
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,970
yes

554
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,309
[Music]

555
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,840
yeah there you go

556
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,080
thanks for the demo

557
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,240
the future for siri

558
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,840
we're currently working on embedding

559
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,640
siri links in our standards

560
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,559
you saw a mock-up

561
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,760
of acs with an extra column

562
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
having these cre links

563
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,120
once you have those you can quickly jump

564
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,919
from

565
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,880
the svs sources to the

566
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,039
testing guide sources or

567
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,600
cwe sources or

568
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,400
nist sources everything available so if

569
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,080
you're looking into

570
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,320
encrypting personal data at rest you can

571
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,159
find everything about cryptography but

572
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,960
also about personal data from various

573
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,840
resources and you can think that

574
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,760
uh for example

575
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,880
um

576
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,559
you want to have articles in there uh as

577
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,440
well more the guideline work that that

578
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,840
can happen and as a user you can then

579
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,320
specify what type of resources you find

580
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
interesting to see when you are linked

581
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,000
using the the siri that's one of the

582
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,039
features that we're thinking about

583
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,480
also we're in a progress uh a process of

584
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,240
aligning with standard makers and other

585
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,600
stakeholders

586
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,720
to uh to connect more standards

587
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,480
and spiros you wanted to share something

588
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,279
about our cool feature ideas right

589
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,080
yeah so the crd application you just saw

590
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,120
it's

591
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,159
a relatively simple graph database and

592
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,880
the front end on top of it plus

593
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,720
significant parsing

594
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,480
because we have

595
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,640
like because math pretty much like if

596
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,960
you have a graph you can easily find

597
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,799
parts in it so you can do

598
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,960
gap analysis

599
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,600
if because graph structures are easy to

600
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,159
customize and copy and keep track of you

601
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,559
can have personal profiles where you can

602
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,440
have your own structure or

603
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,000
pretty much start your own cres for easy

604
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,039
retrieval you can do some uh smart

605
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,600
ranking by seeing how many people prefer

606
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,640
cre

607
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,760
you can have

608
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,640
specific urls with selected arguments so

609
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,200
that you can retrieve multiple standards

610
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,840
or multiple cres or multiple even gap

611
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,080
analysis between different things

612
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,360
at once

613
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,640
and

614
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,039
a ton of other features

615
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:01,840
that

616
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,320
this kind of structure

617
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,439
supports pretty easily

618
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,080
yes and before you start to think what's

619
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,320
what's your business model uh there's no

620
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,000
business model

621
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,520
we built this

622
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,400
for

623
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,159
for the community

624
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,919
because we are the community and we

625
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,480
benefit from it ourselves already we are

626
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,760
using

627
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,600
open theory

628
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,200
in our work

629
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,360
for example for doing uh for doing code

630
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,480
review

631
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,840
uh it's already useful and would like to

632
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,200
spread the word and perhaps you like to

633
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,039
join in on spreading the word

634
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,200
so brief summary

635
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,279
siri enables alignment and

636
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,799
cross-reference between security

637
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,799
standards and guidelines to make it

638
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,720
easier for standard makers to make it

639
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,559
easier to find and use relevant

640
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,640
information for everybody involved in

641
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,559
application security

642
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,240
as a bonus

643
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,960
we attain shared understanding in the

644
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
market and industry on what security

645
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,360
means and there is a big need for that

646
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
that's my observation

647
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,960
and we also achieve

648
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,600
more consistency and less gaps between

649
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,120
standards

650
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,240
so

651
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,840
the future is simple

652
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,679
not yet but we're working on it right

653
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,200
our call to action to you is

654
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,760
use opensiri.org and spread the word

655
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,240
about it use social media show it to

656
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,880
your friends show it to your colleagues

657
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,039
and also if you have ideas about it

658
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,840
provide your feedback and ideas in this

659
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,240
repo shown here you can contribute there

660
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
are instructions for it

661
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,480
and also if you have mappings between

662
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,440
standards we'd like you to share them so

663
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,799
as said

664
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,520
the

665
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,440
auto maintaining feature of cre is quite

666
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,880
important if standards link

667
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,240
to the cre

668
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,400
that link will always keep on working if

669
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,320
the link is made from the standard but

670
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
if it's not yet in the standard we are

671
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,880
interested in mappings

672
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,440
join the mailing list project

673
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,240
siri os.org send subscribe to it and you

674
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,039
will

675
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,279
be kept up to date by us

676
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,760
join us perhaps join our team look at

677
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,679
the integration standards

678
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,679
project page here

679
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,679
and if you're a standard maker

680
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,919
our call to action is standard makers

681
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,720
unite and start using the siri

682
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,080
links to other standards will never

683
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,320
break your standard becomes instantly

684
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,559
accessible through siri

685
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,399
you provide your viewers access to a

686
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,880
large range of related resources so you

687
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,399
will need to discuss all these topics

688
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,760
yourself
