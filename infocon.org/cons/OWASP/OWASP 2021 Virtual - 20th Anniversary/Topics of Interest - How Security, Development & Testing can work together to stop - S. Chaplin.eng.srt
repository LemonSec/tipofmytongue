[Music]

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,639
so today i'm gonna thank you everyone

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,400
for joining uh good morning good

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,960
afternoon good evening and today i'm

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
going to be talking about how security

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,560
development and testing can work

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,119
together to stop the same recurring

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,080
vulnerabilities appearing in the oas top

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,960
10. so yep i'm stephanie chaplin also

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,960
known as devstaffops you can find me on

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,440
twitter linkedin instagram youtube i'm

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,600
in a couple of places and yeah i'm a

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,520
solutions architect at a company called

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,360
secure code warrior but i'm not here to

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,719
talk about that

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,840
so

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,680
agenda first i'm going to talk a little

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,760
bit you know just about me who am i why

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,039
why are you here why are you listening

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:47,920
to me

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,960
then i'm going to look at oh wasp top 10

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,559
through the ages because it has changed

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,000
but it hasn't changed that much but

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,760
we'll come to that in a minute then

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,520
we're talking about the silos you know

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,039
you've got all your different personas

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,840
so you know who are they what motivates

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,400
them how do we break down the silos and

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,840
also how do we embed security into the

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,080
software development life lifecycle

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,640
finally i will be doing q a on slack so

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,080
you can see the slack channel at the

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,640
bottom it's the topics of interest so

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,720
feel free to you know ask questions as

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,560
we go along i'll be joining the channel

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,840
at the end to answer any

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,680
questions so a little bit about me i'm

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,360
going to keep it short but just for you

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,439
know your understanding i used to be a

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,560
developer java python little bit of c

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
but i don't really talk about that

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,320
then i moved into devsecops like i

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,640
really cut my teeth in looking at open

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,720
source software it was a company called

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,479
sonotype and that's when i got a real

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,640
experience of everything devops and

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
everything cyber security and i often

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,720
say about whether it's about security

49
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,680
engineers or champions or well general

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,960
people within

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,520
uh a passion in security can often but

52
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,840
start to become a paranoia in security

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,360
and i'm definitely verging to the point

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
where i'm like oh my gosh the world we

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,799
live in are we even safe but anyway

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,119
that's a different story and right now i

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,520
am at secure code warrior which is uh

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,440
security training for developers all

59
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
about starting left rather than shifting

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
left

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,640
so

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,599
oh wasp top 10 through the ages i

63
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,200
haven't gone all the way back because

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
the first oh what top 10 was actually in

65
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,239
2003 so i'm starting off you know with

66
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,879
2007. so we can see we've got some

67
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,640
familiar vulnerabilities you know

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,280
injection floors cross-site scripting

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,800
authentication

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,080
um so these are these are

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,160
vulnerabilities that keep popping up

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,640
again and again and you can see as well

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,120
with the top ten there's not that much

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
of a change um you can see a couple of

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,519
things drop a couple of things added and

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,640
similarly when we then move to 2013 and

77
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,800
the you know most recent official one

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
2017 we can see injection floors is

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,440
staying pretty much at the top we've

80
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,599
still got authentication cross-site

81
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
scripting moving around a bit but

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,760
there's a lot of you know there's a lot

83
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,800
of similarity so we're seeing

84
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,040
the same recurring vulnerabilities again

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,560
and again

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
so with the latest version if you

87
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,239
haven't seen it you should check it out

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,040
it's very exciting but we now have at

89
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,640
least the draft you know ready for peer

90
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,519
review for 2021 and there are quite a

91
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,680
few changes in this and it's not just

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,599
about the topics which i'll discuss in a

93
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,879
minute but also the methodologies for

94
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,840
how the 2021 were calculated um

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,080
traditionally we look at cwe's i say we

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,400
i was but traditionally os will look at

97
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,560
cwes and what they found is they were

98
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,440
kind of focusing on the top 30 um with

99
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,959
this year's

100
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,840
version it looked a lot wider um you

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,599
know we looked at like 500 000

102
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,920
applications um instead of looking for

103
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,799
30 cwes we looked at 400. uh so a cwe is

104
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,360
um it's like a type of vulnerability um

105
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,000
so for example um a10 on 2021 uh ssrf

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,959
that is a cwe well say for example

107
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,120
insecure design which i'll talk about in

108
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,680
a minute is actually a group of almost

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,040
40 cwes and each has it's got an average

110
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,199
of i think it was i think it said 19.6

111
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
we'll call that 20 amongst the different

112
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,798
topics

113
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,280
so looking at the actual change we can

114
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,560
see um injection has been knocked off

115
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
the top it's also been merged with

116
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,320
crosstalk scripting

117
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,960
we have broken access control so you

118
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,840
know all about permissions access you

119
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
know when i i do a lot of training for

120
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,840
sales people and i say my simplification

121
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,080
for this is don't make everyone admin

122
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,120
you know have permissions um etc and

123
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
something that's really interesting with

124
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,360
uh the the latest version is we're

125
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,560
looking

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,759
at the cause not the symptoms

127
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,400
so we can see uh the 2017 sensitive data

128
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960
exposure uh that's

129
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,520
um you know that's more of a cause sorry

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,600
a symptom and then now we're going to

131
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,880
cryptographic failures because that's

132
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
the usual reason

133
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,759
and the final one that i'm going to talk

134
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,520
about well a lot is insecure design

135
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,560
because that is a brand new topic

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,240
and the reason i think it's you know

137
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
quite cool is it's talking about design

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,960
flaws so as an industry we're all trying

139
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,199
to move left shift left start left we're

140
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
all going that direction

141
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,360
and with insecure design it's going you

142
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,960
know even further you know back we're

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,240
thinking about stuff like threat

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,160
modeling we're thinking about secure

145
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,639
design patterns and principles reference

146
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,960
architectures because you need to start

147
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,639
thinking about you know you need to

148
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,120
design securely before you start coding

149
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,440
implementing etc security cannot be an

150
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,120
afterthought because that's kind of how

151
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
we've got in this whole situation of the

152
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,240
same recurring vulnerabilities and why i

153
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,199
am speaking to you now about this

154
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,000
so

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,440
i think of it a little bit like an

156
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
iceberg because

157
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,280
i was top ten you know that's why we're

158
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,880
here that's the ones we've got to focus

159
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
on but take for example you know i

160
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,080
mentioned ssrf is the new number 10. so

161
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,319
csrf was actually in nearly all the

162
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,800
other years so we talk about the os top

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,600
10

164
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,680
but what about owasp11 os 12 13

165
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,000
obviously we don't rank those but

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,479
security is not you know the ostrich 10

167
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,840
is awesome and they are the most you

168
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
know prevalent but there is a whole

169
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,160
iceberg of what we need to look at um

170
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
others of you may know the sans top 25

171
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,639
so these are the top

172
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,080
top 25 cwes and this is the thing your

173
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,840
scope's going bigger and right now we're

174
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,160
talking about application security very

175
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,520
important

176
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,319
what about you know cloud security we're

177
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,160
all migrating at the moment you know

178
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,319
networking environments mobile iot it's

179
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,199
not just um you know you know design

180
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,520
vulnerabilities ssrf there's there's a

181
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,280
whole there's a whole you know iceberg

182
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,120
out there and i put this at the bottom

183
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,440
but we don't ever like to talk about it

184
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,039
what about human error

185
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,759
it can be innocent um it can be you know

186
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,880
tiredness

187
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,960
um occasionally malicious but that's a

188
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,440
different topic um but a lot of a lot of

189
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,120
vulnerabilities are caused by that and

190
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,440
i've even got a stat i think on there in

191
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,599
a few slides this time

192
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,680
oh no it's sorry it's on this slide

193
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,599
so i've got a couple of stats here i'm

194
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,000
not going to read off the slide as such

195
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
but maybe if i look at the the very

196
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,440
bottom

197
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,400
uh the average cost of a data breach is

198
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,800
nearly 4 million and when we look at

199
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,599
that

200
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,720
okay um is that um does that take into

201
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,080
account brand

202
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,400
because um there is a very famous

203
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,880
organization uh that had a bad version

204
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,759
of struts in about 2017 and they lost

205
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,840
one third of their market cap like they

206
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,160
lost i think it was like five billion uh

207
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
it was pre-gdpr otherwise they would

208
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,520
have been heavily fined and i'm not

209
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,599
gonna name and shame but um anyone in

210
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,960
the open source space probably knows

211
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,479
what i'm talking about and in terms of

212
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,479
with brand it's been four years later

213
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,599
and people you know still know who this

214
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,759
company is so you know no one wants to

215
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,639
be on the front page and a lot of these

216
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,960
um vulnerabilities um or you know the

217
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,160
attack vectors uh are web-based

218
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,240
so you know coming from you know the the

219
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,000
application code so

220
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,840
um this is something that we do need to

221
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,000
focus on as well as the rest of the

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,960
iceberg um my other stats okay slightly

223
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
old uh because we've also got the 2021

224
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,520
version as of very recently but um

225
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,479
injection flaws is still in the top ten

226
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,160
it's been number one for like i don't

227
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,440
know what was it like maybe 10 14 years

228
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,080
um but this is the thing it's the same

229
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,200
vulnerabilities funny story our cto used

230
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,320
to be a pen tester and he was aware that

231
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,959
the same recurring vulnerabilities kept

232
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,120
coming again and again so he's like okay

233
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
so how do we how do we fix this okay

234
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,880
who's writing the code let's go to the

235
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,519
source let's um let's you know work on

236
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,120
the cause of this and then we have

237
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,680
secure code warrior but anyway

238
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,040
um and the final one of my stats

239
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,640
25

240
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,880
of all data breaches last year were

241
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,519
caused by human error and that's the

242
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,920
thing we are humans we can write as many

243
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,440
tests and have as many security

244
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,680
protocols as as we possibly can and

245
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,120
that's great and we should continue

246
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,800
doing that but sometimes people make

247
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,959
mistakes and it's not just insecurity i

248
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,440
think one of those article i read a few

249
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,200
years ago and it was talking about some

250
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,600
of the most costly mistakes ever but

251
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,240
from a finance perspective and there was

252
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
it was in japan

253
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,480
and i think it was meant to be one share

254
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,279
was 225 000 yen

255
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,160
accidentally got the numbers mixed up um

256
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,880
so they put

257
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,160
225 000 shares for one yen and i think

258
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,600
it look knocked like i don't know i

259
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,040
can't remember it's like five or maybe

260
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,839
eleven percent off the nikkei for the

261
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,959
day i wouldn't have wanted to be that

262
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,440
person if i'm honest um so anyway this

263
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,200
is the thing it's not just tech it's not

264
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,440
just security it's you know we are human

265
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,200
things happen and we need to try and

266
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,800
prevent this

267
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,680
so

268
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,760
let's talk about our personas

269
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,920
so i put secure i put testing on the

270
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,000
left with a little power button

271
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
we've got security in the middle with a

272
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
little shield and then i've got my

273
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,000
developer in my in my brackets

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,399
and this is the thing we're all very

275
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,560
very siloed so my background i used to

276
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,320
be a developer it puts me kind of in the

277
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,160
right and now i work in security in the

278
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,920
middle i've done a bit of testing but

279
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,720
anyway we all have very very different

280
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,519
motivators developer we like our new and

281
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,360
shiny we we like to do things we're

282
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,200
usually quite creative i like to think

283
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,399
we're quite intelligent we're into

284
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,480
problem solving and we like to focus and

285
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,720
we also like our tools you know if it's

286
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,279
if it's outside our ide it might not get

287
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,760
attended to very often etc

288
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,519
um and that's the thing developers are

289
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,399
motivated

290
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,240
by you know features functions they've

291
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,920
got their deadlines we've got our sprint

292
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,399
cycles you know that's that's our our

293
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,519
game

294
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,079
security uh they're trying to find the

295
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,079
problem and the thing about security is

296
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,240
you can find one problem and you kind of

297
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,839
done your job and developers on the

298
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,880
other hand have to make sure

299
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,600
everything's um you know secure so it's

300
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,120
it's a it's definitely an interesting

301
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,760
paradigm um and and they speak different

302
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,720
languages so i talk a lot about username

303
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,399
enumeration because i've got some

304
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
developer friends and i say to them i'm

305
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,839
like do you know what username and

306
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,000
enumeration is and they start talking

307
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,839
about you know type enum and going down

308
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,000
this path and okay okay i understand why

309
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,079
you think that because i'm the next dev

310
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,920
i'm like actually it's when you're

311
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,040
logging in

312
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,360
and if you said if you get your password

313
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,160
wrong and and then you uh the

314
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,480
application says to you your password is

315
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,360
wrong then that's then you know hacker

316
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,800
knows oh i've got the right username

317
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,519
let's you know brute force this um so

318
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,560
you know when i was talking to my

319
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,720
developer and he he smiled he's like oh

320
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,399
yeah that happened to us

321
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,320
um so that's the thing it's this it's

322
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,880
the lexicon it's the terminology um it's

323
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,120
the motivators and then you have testers

324
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,519
as well and testers are kind of not

325
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,720
going to stay like a hybrid they're

326
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,560
obviously motivated by you know getting

327
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,320
all the tests done but i've been reading

328
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,560
the unicorn project recently and one of

329
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,480
my favorite moments is when the main

330
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,639
character decides to throw a party for

331
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,320
testing and all of testing are really

332
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,480
surprised like oh wow no no one's ever

333
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,800
thrown us a party um yeah for testing

334
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,040
day and that's the thing it's about

335
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,279
understanding how to motivate your

336
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,320
different personas so um

337
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
example throw them a party that's not

338
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,480
always practical i actually had a friend

339
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,440
who worked at co-ops so co-op is a

340
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,800
well it's a large organization but he

341
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,639
was specifically in the supermarket in

342
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,040
the food area doing new research and

343
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,639
development for food so he had a big

344
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,720
fridge so whenever he needed something

345
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,480
say oh finance or other department he'd

346
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,760
walk around the head office with like

347
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,240
loads of cupcakes and then he would ask

348
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,680
the person oh yeah i kind of need that

349
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,760
thing oh do you want do you want a cake

350
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,079
um so that isn't always possible you

351
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,240
know in a virtual world but it's all

352
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,800
about understanding who and what

353
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
motivates them because a lot of the time

354
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,399
when you get developer and security it

355
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,600
can go

356
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,519
a bit um

357
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,120
it can go either way

358
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,440
and what we're really trying to do is

359
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,880
it's almost like the year of the empath

360
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,600
you know 2021 security's not the bad guy

361
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,279
neither is testing developers just want

362
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,120
to do the best thing possible no one

363
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,519
wants to be on the front page so how do

364
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,760
we achieve that

365
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,399
and also why do we achieve that so

366
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,959
part of the reason the old bugs keep

367
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,720
performing new tricks this is an example

368
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,519
of sql injection um you know

369
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,040
sql injection

370
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,639
came out in about 1998 guess when the

371
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,760
fix came out also 1998 so we're looking

372
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,880
at about 23 years of the same

373
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
vulnerabilities appearing again and

374
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,199
again and this problem isn't going away

375
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,000
because to quote notorious big

376
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,800
uh more vulnerability oh sorry more code

377
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,440
more vulnerabilities because we've got

378
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
you know we've got obviously the number

379
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
of developers increasing uh we've got

380
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,959
you know number of languages number of

381
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,720
environments now everyone has a mobile

382
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,639
team you know you've got your cloud team

383
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,880
you know it's not just looking at oh

384
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,199
yeah my web-based server anymore it's

385
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,199
you you've got you know such a massive

386
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,440
scope so head to the source just like

387
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,720
with our new os 21 we want to look at

388
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,680
the root cause not the symptoms like i

389
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,519
love testing testing is great you've got

390
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,760
sas dust os has so many amazing tools

391
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,320
for that but you can't test your way to

392
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,519
the solution

393
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,279
testing will help you find it but it

394
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,199
won't you know it won't necessarily help

395
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,800
you fix it

396
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,959
and this is what we're trying to do

397
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,680
break the cycle of recurring

398
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,639
vulnerabilities and this is actually um

399
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,079
this is one of my favorite slides and

400
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,279
i'll tell you why when i get there but

401
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,720
i'll talk you through the flight so

402
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,079
we're going to start in the in the top

403
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,000
left where it says bug reappears i'm

404
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,199
going to pretend it's bug appears

405
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,199
because we're starting the flow so

406
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,199
a bug appears okay

407
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,800
there's a bug in the system then the

408
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,120
security will step in they will test

409
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
they find the vulnerabilities for

410
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,720
security it's like okay we found a

411
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,639
problem it needs to be fixed you know we

412
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,040
can't release this this is a big deal so

413
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,199
at which point they will probably put it

414
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,839
into a bug tracking system um you know

415
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,279
loading the results at which point

416
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,600
security is like my job is done i'll

417
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,440
make sure it's fixed but you know i i've

418
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,680
done my bits etc

419
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,760
and this is where this is the bit of the

420
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,279
slide that i like

421
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,639
developer

422
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,079
finds way to fix the problem

423
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,240
is it the best way

424
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,120
we hope so is it the most efficient is

425
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,560
it the accurate way

426
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,120
is it a case where the developers behind

427
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,279
budget behind schedule tired might not

428
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,720
even understand what the vulnerability

429
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,880
is and says oh yeah false positive oh

430
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,399
this doesn't affect us i'm not using

431
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,279
that library it's fine um and this is

432
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,000
the thing our developers do do they know

433
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,680
the best way you know it's like i

434
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,079
mentioned the username enumeration um

435
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,440
does a developer even know what that

436
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,320
means

437
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,000
does the developer have the bandwidth to

438
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,079
go google it and go read up on our wasp

439
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,560
and understand this we need to think

440
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,440
about you know how how we can you know

441
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,759
level up everyone you know make everyone

442
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,600
a security champion in terms of have

443
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
that basic level and the same with

444
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,759
testing we can get even testers you know

445
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,680
whether it's pen testers

446
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,880
whether it's you know running the

447
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,240
testing tools etc yeah being able to to

448
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,199
understand you know have this um

449
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,519
like mono culture mono supportive

450
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,360
culture you know where where it's no

451
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,720
longer a case of pointing the finger

452
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,040
it's like let's fix this together we're

453
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,720
all on the same team we work for the

454
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,079
same company let's get it done etc so my

455
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,240
developer has found a way to fix the

456
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,959
problem but guess what you know

457
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,399
retention's a little hard at the moment

458
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,399
with with development people move teams

459
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,800
people move orgs and the knowledge that

460
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,440
was obtained disappears into a black

461
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,519
hole and guess what then the bug

462
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,600
reappears let me start this cycle and

463
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,519
working in development you know it's bad

464
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,279
enough fixing your own problems like you

465
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,040
know your own vulnerabilities but it's

466
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,480
even worse when it's someone who left

467
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,079
before or the new team and then you're

468
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,160
trying to understand other people's code

469
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,320
and it's still it starts to become you

470
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,240
know difficult monotonous you know

471
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,759
developers don't really it's not it's

472
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,119
not our favorite part of job we like

473
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,720
creating but you know i've heard some

474
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,039
stats well i've had some stats about

475
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,559
developers spend about nine percent of

476
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,240
that time writing code and when i

477
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,480
started in development uh i was told i'm

478
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,640
going to spend 10 of the time writing

479
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,039
and percent debugging and

480
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,119
pretty i'd say that's pretty accurate

481
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,959
and like i say about the oh what's top

482
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,679
ten

483
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,679
there isn't you know there's more it's

484
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,280
an iceberg there's more than ten

485
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,440
vulnerabilities you know if you look at

486
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,400
this there's over 125 and when we look

487
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,440
at the top 21 there was four a total of

488
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,320
400 cwes and that can be like i said

489
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,520
from ssrf um csrf etc to much broader

490
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,120
like authentication for example you've

491
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,679
got a lot of different you know

492
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,720
associated with that

493
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,840
so

494
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,360
how do we embed security some people

495
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,679
talk about devsecops or sec devops or

496
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,080
secure devops and they just assume it's

497
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,000
like a line in the middle like okay

498
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,080
we've put some sass scanning or you know

499
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,600
we've got we've got some testing as part

500
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,840
of ci when it goes from dev to ops you

501
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,080
know we're doing security

502
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,000
and it's not quite that easy

503
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,039
so there are a lot of you know the best

504
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,799
advice i can give is embed security at

505
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,760
every step so part of the reason i'm so

506
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,400
excited about uh the new um insecure

507
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
design category is because we're

508
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,840
starting to look at the plan stage you

509
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,000
know threat modelling um policies

510
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,559
policies as code is a really growth area

511
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,880
um so we need to like even before you

512
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,640
know we have you know pen to paper you

513
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,880
know finger to keyboard we need to start

514
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,720
thinking about architectures having you

515
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,200
know this secure by design approach

516
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,640
then when we're obviously coding we're

517
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,000
going to start doing you know some maybe

518
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,840
some sas scanning we can also do peer

519
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,160
review i like peer reviews but they're

520
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,120
normally about the functionality um

521
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,960
is the person peer reviewing are they a

522
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,360
security expert they probably think they

523
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,120
are but but are they

524
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,600
um and and that's the thing

525
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,640
a lot of the time we're reliant on um

526
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,000
you know um

527
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,080
i want to say optimism but it's like

528
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,760
yeah yeah no it's fine don't worry about

529
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,400
it

530
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,840
you know let's just let's just get it

531
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,280
through because we all have deadlines we

532
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,039
all have priorities no one wants to be

533
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,039
there at you know 7 p.m on a friday with

534
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,400
a broken build and fixing

535
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,640
vulnerabilities well i'm not going to

536
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,160
stereotype i'm sure some people do but

537
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,840
you know what i mean

538
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,120
so all of the things i've been talking

539
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,799
about so far more in the dev stage

540
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,400
you've also got penetration testing as

541
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,559
well but then we have the whole upstage

542
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,080
and i think that's sometimes overlooked

543
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,280
a bit like for example um the old a10 i

544
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,440
think it's now a9 i am one of those cool

545
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,320
people who knows my top ten but um it

546
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
was called insufficient logging and

547
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,520
monitoring um and this is like really

548
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,240
understated this is so important because

549
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,960
inevitably touching all the words

550
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,039
um unfortunately whether it's on a

551
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,720
personal level or on a professional

552
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,400
level we probably are all gonna get

553
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,080
hacked one day i actually got my um

554
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,280
what's it called you know the gaming

555
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,520
steam i got my steam account hacked just

556
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,120
before i went to a conference in sweden

557
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,799
a few years ago and i was like oh wow

558
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,080
it's happened to me maybe this is the

559
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,720
only time fingers crossed um but anyway

560
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,880
that's why logging and monitoring is so

561
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,960
important because the company that i

562
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,600
mentioned you know from 2017 it took

563
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,280
them three months to notice that they

564
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,039
were being hacked imagine how much

565
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,440
damage you can do in three months and if

566
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,480
i was going to look at the whole of

567
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,919
security obviously everything is

568
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,000
important but for me one of the most

569
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,440
important areas is your incident

570
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,200
response team you know okay you've been

571
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,120
hacked how quickly can you notice how

572
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,640
quickly can you kick them out how

573
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,120
quickly can you contain you know what's

574
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,360
going on so it's really important to

575
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,039
have this at each stage and you know

576
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,559
traditionally we think of developers you

577
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,559
know on the left and up on the right but

578
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,919
it's really about having this

579
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,760
understanding of all of these different

580
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
security checkpoints because think about

581
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,159
poor security their workforce security

582
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,000
that they have to be aware of all of

583
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,600
these stages and we're just talking

584
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,120
about app sec at the moment so what

585
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,600
about with the cloud you know okay so or

586
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
you know we're using containers are we

587
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,640
doing container scanning where are our

588
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,320
containers are they in kubernetes or are

589
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,240
they also in you know the cloud as well

590
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,720
so there's so much so that's why i

591
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,120
really say that it's not about just all

592
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,480
the tools like you could buy all these

593
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,760
tools and are you doing devsecops well

594
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,559
you're on paper potentially but it's

595
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,520
much more it's a culture piece it's a

596
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,120
people piece it's about you know the

597
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,799
empathy it's no longer pointing the

598
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,840
finger at the bad guy etc

599
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,520
so yeah changing culture is key

600
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,600
and this can be done in multiple ways

601
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,080
you know bottom up top down say middle

602
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,400
up and down etc um but having a you know

603
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,760
we want to get rid of the culture of

604
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,679
fear so even when we look at w edward

605
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,080
deming who did all the car research um

606
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,280
you know um

607
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,400
back in the kind of 60s and 70s um

608
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,760
even then he said we can't have a

609
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
culture of fear because if there is a

610
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,080
problem we need to report it we need to

611
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,720
find out what happened how it happened

612
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,480
how to make sure it doesn't happen again

613
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,840
and the person reporting or

614
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,919
whistleblowing needs to feel safe like

615
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,840
if that person feels that they're then

616
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,120
going to be you know fired um then um

617
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,720
you know they're probably not going to

618
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,400
um they're probably they might falsify

619
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,000
things they might sweep things under the

620
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,159
carpet i was reading i was reading a lot

621
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,559
about fear culture recently um and the

622
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,039
example they gave was a nokia because i

623
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,799
think we all remember the nokia mobile

624
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,880
phones and the monopoly they had

625
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,720
um and actually part of what went wrong

626
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,080
we all think it was to do with the apple

627
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,280
and the iphone but actually if you do

628
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,360
read up it's quite interesting it was as

629
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,120
well to do with the culture because

630
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,799
there was more of a the top level

631
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,880
management you know wanted growth the

632
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,559
middle management were a bit terrified

633
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,400
and obviously the bottom level just

634
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
doing their normal job but because

635
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,760
middle management one didn't you know

636
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,000
there was a fear culture they they were

637
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,080
afraid to you know report the truth that

638
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,000
starts to become a disconnect

639
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,360
and this is the thing that it's the

640
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,480
culture this shapes the values and

641
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,039
attitudes and it shapes the actions so

642
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,640
we talk about you know all of the

643
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,880
security tools i talked about before and

644
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,720
all your different personas but we just

645
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,640
have to remember we are we're all trying

646
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,240
to do the right thing security aren't

647
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,559
the bad guy you know testing is

648
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,720
absolutely fundamentally necessary

649
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,960
developers are very busy but you know

650
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,159
they've got a lot on their plate but

651
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,400
they need to um you know be able to

652
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,480
relate to all personas and i think at

653
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,159
the moment everything's virtual and oral

654
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,400
remote as we as we gradually go back to

655
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,960
offices we'll we'll see what happens but

656
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,640
that's kind of almost my most

657
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,440
fundamental message um you know of this

658
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,679
it really is about understanding the

659
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,000
people changing the culture and you can

660
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,840
do that as an individual you can do it

661
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,720
as a senior management it's really about

662
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,960
taking a more progressive and empathetic

663
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,520
approach so that you can resolve all the

664
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,320
security issues together because like i

665
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,880
said the same recurring vulnerabilities

666
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,559
keep appearing i think that would be

667
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,240
something i'd love to see probably by

668
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,120
now 2025 but if we could just change

669
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,720
them because we're like guess what we

670
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,799
sold the owasp top 10. now we're

671
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,840
focusing on 11 12 13 you know up to 20

672
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,360
etc

673
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,960
but you know we'll see i'm always an

674
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,039
optimist about this

675
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,760
and this is this is something that i i

676
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,279
like to think of i did kind of allude to

677
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,600
it earlier but security champions we

678
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,440
often think of these as developers i

679
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,880
call them either with a passion or

680
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,600
paranoia about security but why do they

681
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,640
have to be developers can't a tester be

682
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,400
a security champion

683
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,720
um what about someone in finance you

684
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,799
know who's with the cfo being like uh

685
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,400
yeah i've been reading about ransomware

686
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,840
in the news and i heard about the

687
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,760
pipeline in america i think we should

688
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,279
invest more let me let me give you some

689
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,360
more discretionary budget you know it's

690
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,919
about really having this security first

691
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,640
approach no matter who you are so that

692
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,320
as well you know security champions

693
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,840
doesn't have to be developer it can be

694
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,360
anyone you can be in security and you

695
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,000
can be a security champion

696
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,799
so

697
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,799
to summarize

698
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,840
security threats are ever evolving and a

699
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,320
developer-led approach is needed to

700
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,679
detect

701
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,159
and eliminate risk i think especially

702
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,600
with eliminate because we're great at

703
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,440
the testing we're detecting risk i'm

704
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,039
sure everyone out there in an enterprise

705
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,679
org will have multiple you know little

706
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,279
uh multiple reports red risk orange cvss

707
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,840
you know it's it's bad but we really

708
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,559
need to focus on eliminating the risk

709
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,760
how do we do that embedding security at

710
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,480
every stage and breaking down the silos

711
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,760
and it's not just between the three

712
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,679
personas i've mentioned you know between

713
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,279
the commercial team as well between

714
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,400
product project managers etc

715
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,480
and finally changing culture is key

716
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,600
and giving teams the tools to do that

717
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,799
really helps

718
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,600
and you a funny story just before i

719
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,679
close there i was a few years ago you

720
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,840
know taking a train home to my parents

721
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,240
um just on instagram stories i see a

722
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,840
friend of a friend she like works in

723
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,279
fashion she's working at her uncle

724
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,640
startup like doing like um social media

725
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,559
she's editing html on a word document

726
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,240
and she captioned it like oh my god

727
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,400
coding's so hard i'm like if you're

728
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,440
literally changing tags and colons and

729
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,919
everything on word of course it is at

730
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,120
which point you know i sent her a

731
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,400
message i'm like have you ever heard of

732
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,720
an ide but anyway that's a bit of a

733
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
silly example but give the teams the

734
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,880
right tools change the culture avoid

735
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,120
fear embed security at every stage

736
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,200
detect and eliminate risk

737
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,440
