want to kind of talk about what stuff's

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,119
uh what stuff's happening in the in the

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,880
future

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,600
for for those who don't know let me just

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,040
kind of quickly walk through the history

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,119
of how olaf started

34
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,000
um

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,200
recently in life i actually got

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,840
diagnosed as being bipolar um and if

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,759
you're familiar with or you know about

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,680
what bipolar is it's manic depression

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,920
it's the new word for manic depression

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,560
and uh mania is

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,720
essentially where you get fixated on a

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,560
problem you you don't take no for an

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,640
answer you you essentially do things

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,799
that are potentially risky potentially

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,799
dangerous um and you you often don't

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,079
listen to people

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,240
and it's interesting looking back on

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,640
life um about various things that have

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,479
happened um

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,439
buying crazy houses off of uh you know a

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,680
whim and all sorts of crazy stories that

52
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
uh that i can share but it's also

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,119
probably

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,960
owasp was created in a very mild and

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,119
early form of mania

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,000
which which is is is kind of interesting

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,800
um

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,160
for those who don't know i was

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,560
moderating a mailing list called web

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,360
apsec um way before the slack stuff it i

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
found the oauth slack recently it's like

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
15 000 people on that slack which is

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,720
which is amazing

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,120
i think we had about a thousand people

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,720
on a mailing list it was a sister

66
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
mailing list for bug track if you're

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
familiar with what bug track is it was

68
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
the way that everyone discussed uh

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,040
security in general back in those days

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,720
and we had a bunch of people on that

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,640
mailing list um and i was running

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,560
software security at charles schwab the

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,440
big financial services company um

74
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,239
here in the in the us in san francisco

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,879
and we got on the front page of the wall

76
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,760
street journal um we had a security

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,200
problem it was a cross-site scripting

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,480
problem and the cio came running down

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,800
the hallway and said who's the new guy

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,959
running appsec and it was me

81
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,120
and hey what's this problem and what are

82
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,879
we going to do about it

83
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,080
and what essentially ensued is that we

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,319
had had three people complained through

85
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,680
the call center

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
one was the person who ultimately

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,879
reported the problem

88
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,239
and then two people were vendors trying

89
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,800
to sell us uh a magic technology

90
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,720
solution for the problem

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,599
but the challenge i had as the apsec guy

92
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,840
is that when people were questioned and

93
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
say hey what you're saying we should do

94
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,799
and what you're saying we shouldn't do

95
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,120
these vendors are saying this thing

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,360
what's the truth here where is the place

97
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,519
on the internet that we can go and look

98
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,080
at the independent information

99
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,400
and frankly i thought this is just crazy

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,519
this is absolutely you know nuts and

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,799
someone needs to go figure out how to

102
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,319
solve this problem

103
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,040
so

104
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,879
i went to a bunch of people that i

105
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,040
trusted on the web appsec mailing list

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,959
and said hey i'm going to go solve this

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,480
this problem a bunch of people said

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,319
you're absolutely crazy um you're never

109
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,000
going to be able to be able to make a

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,519
make an impact you have to go and

111
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,239
document massive amounts of stuff you're

112
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,519
going to wind up with a whole lot of

113
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,400
people contradicting you um but like i

114
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,280
said it was uh sodium um i'm going to go

115
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
ahead and do it and

116
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
what what often happens when you when

117
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,560
you have that condition as well is you

118
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,120
get itself into a mode where your brain

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,880
operates very very effectively and i

120
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
quite literally spent 48 hours over a

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
weekend without sleeping

122
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,280
writing a document and that document

123
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,000
ultimately became the first version of

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,520
the owasp guide it wasn't one of the

125
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,199
things that we launched with um and

126
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,880
frankly it was awful looking back at it

127
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,800
um as andrew vandestalk will tell you he

128
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,639
uh he had to rewrite pretty much it from

129
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,720
the ground from the ground up but

130
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,160
but that was basically kind of how it

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,960
how it happened we had a static html

132
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,880
website um

133
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,240
that if you wanted to go and upload it

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,720
you have to uh use ftp to go

135
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,040
push a piece of content to it and uh

136
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,880
and away we went um

137
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,160
and honestly that is my last major

138
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
contribution to owasp i

139
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,199
started it i got the thing going but os

140
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,600
success is due to all the people that

141
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,880
have contributed

142
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,960
there have been massive amounts of

143
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,440
contributions over there over the time

144
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
and it's all of everyone's contributions

145
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,919
that have made the things successful

146
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:18,960
um

147
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,120
linus torvalds has a great quote he said

148
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,880
that one of the successes of linux is

149
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,320
because he's lazy and he likes taking

150
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,479
credit for everyone else's work um i

151
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,880
hope i'm neither of those things

152
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,000
so uh neither are those but you know the

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,039
success of any community in any major

154
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,759
project is a result of of everyone

155
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,120
coming together and loads of people

156
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,639
doing work

157
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,360
so on that note i want to make sure that

158
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,600
a bunch of people get get credit whose

159
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,479
names aren't often seen but were

160
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,000
absolutely instrumental in the early

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
days of of the project and

162
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
i honestly i kind of thought a lot about

163
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,160
this slide because what i didn't want to

164
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,479
do was to miss people out and there are

165
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,840
absolutely people that are missed out

166
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,479
here for sure um and there's no there's

167
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,639
no way around that but

168
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,759
these are some names that you often

169
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,039
don't hear about that were absolutely

170
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,120
instrumental in the early days ingo

171
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,280
struck who's over in germany is a

172
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,080
developer extraordinaire and was working

173
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
on all sorts of interesting stuff in the

174
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,759
early days and he was a real developers

175
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,039
developer and was just absolutely

176
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,479
amazing

177
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,520
gabe lawrence who was still around um

178
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,199
had actually tried to start an early

179
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,520
startup um building one of the wet first

180
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,039
and i think it probably was the first

181
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,479
web application firewall um he and a

182
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,240
great crew were just too early to the

183
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,639
market um and as a result couldn't make

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,360
that company commercially successful

185
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,759
um but instead decided to go open source

186
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,639
that code to to owasp and what was the

187
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,319
stinger project which was one of the

188
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,639
first first things

189
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,800
and as we've seen companies you know

190
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,880
signal sciences and and all these other

191
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,000
companies have been incredibly

192
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
successful with that technology they

193
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,560
were just simply too early um

194
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,520
david raphael was was building a bunch

195
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
of tech mike delibero has just always

196
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,919
been there um stan guzik ran the first

197
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,000
ever oauth conference in new jersey i

198
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,319
was logged on earlier and saw tim tom

199
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,680
brennan who's

200
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,039
is another name that's always been

201
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,199
around and but stan music put a lot of

202
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,080
effort into organizing these things um

203
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,800
and so you know a whole list of names

204
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,360
dennis cruz is uh is just a man who

205
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,199
makes me smile he is like the the

206
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,520
duracell bunny who is full of ideas and

207
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,919
just gets done and you know and so

208
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,240
and so it goes on but i wanted to to to

209
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,680
put those names up because they often

210
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,120
don't get credit from from the early

211
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,919
days

212
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,000
but it's thousands of people right the

213
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,680
whole project has been you know

214
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
incredibly um incredibly successful

215
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,759
um

216
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,680
so let me flick through um flick through

217
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,280
a bunch of notes so

218
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,440
this is this is the kind of section

219
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
that's almost like the best man's speech

220
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,879
right this is the wedding speech of like

221
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,919
reflecting on the last 20 years and uh

222
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,120
you can go because oh sol 2020 which is

223
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
which is quite phenomenal to to think

224
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,639
about it um

225
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,319
if you think about what happened 20

226
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,400
years ago um i made a bunch of notes

227
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,199
here

228
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,199
the iphone didn't exist until 2007.

229
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,879
um quite mind-boggling aws launched in

230
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,840
2006

231
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,280
years after oas was started azure was

232
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,879
even later than that 2008

233
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,199
git which we all are totally familiar

234
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,479
with and you'll hear from a special

235
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,759
guest uh later about about git stuff

236
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,519
2005

237
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,039
when we first started owasp we were

238
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,279
using cbs if any if any developers are

239
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,679
that old that know about cvs you're

240
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
you'll cringe completely but that was

241
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,720
what was used to to manage stuff in the

242
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,680
early days um firefox was invented

243
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,839
afterwards safari didn't even exist

244
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,959
chrome came along eight years later

245
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,320
it's pretty amazing to think of really

246
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,760
you know the the people that kind of

247
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,279
jumped in in the early stage and just

248
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,800
how technology has changed over the

249
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,120
space of the last 20 years

250
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,839
if we sit and face down where we are

251
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,279
today

252
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,800
the application security space has

253
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
changed fundamentally as well back in

254
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
the early days of course we built

255
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
everything from from the ground up um

256
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
every piece of code people were building

257
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
crypto libraries and

258
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,800
were building everything themselves

259
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,880
these days we largely assemble

260
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,440
applications it's a combination of you

261
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
know things that are resources and

262
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,120
services that are online from aws you

263
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,480
wouldn't build your own crypto service

264
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,240
today use kms you

265
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,839
you wouldn't you know go and host your

266
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,240
own database you you spin up an rds

267
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,080
instance or something um so it's a

268
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,600
combination of infrastructure certainly

269
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,440
a combination of code that we run and

270
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,000
sometimes run in serverless manners

271
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,720
right and you know on the on the web

272
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,640
um and it's pulling data together from

273
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,560
various different places through apis

274
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,480
data lakes and all of those those good

275
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,080
things so things are fundamentally

276
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,600
changed

277
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,839
of the way we build stuff we're today

278
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,600
even seeing things like infrastructure

279
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
as code i was watching a talk just now

280
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,519
about about ci cd and you know it's not

281
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,000
coders code is still everywhere but in

282
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,079
many cases it's used as glue it's

283
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,079
pulling different things together

284
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,240
so the last 20 years have seen massive

285
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,000
changes in in how we've done things um

286
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,200
we are still

287
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,120
faced with massive problems and massive

288
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,920
problems with open source um as steuben

289
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,000
said my my last company was acquired by

290
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
by vera code and that was doing open

291
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,079
source security around libraries

292
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,839
and that problem is as prevalent today

293
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,519
as it as it ever has been if we look at

294
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,760
what happened with solar winds and we

295
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,120
look at all of these supply chain

296
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,320
problems

297
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,360
there is no shortage of problems that

298
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,160
still exist and are far far from being

299
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,040
solved in that space alone

300
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,279
i have been doing a bunch of work uh

301
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,440
over the last i guess five years with us

302
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,720
intelligence and some of the

303
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,240
intelligence agencies and we've been

304
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,440
looking at

305
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,200
you know how prevalent their

306
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
vulnerabilities are in open source

307
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,560
libraries that are out there

308
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,640
and uh you'll hear later from uh from

309
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,360
steve christie who created the cbe

310
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,079
and when we looked at it i want to say

311
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,079
probably five or six years ago

312
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,399
there were about six thousand cves that

313
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,519
been had been reported and we

314
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,480
pretty

315
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
with pretty high degree of confidence

316
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,600
estimated that they're actually about a

317
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
quarter of them a quarter of a million

318
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,600
of them in the open source libraries

319
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,440
alone because all of the libraries are

320
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,800
getting copied

321
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
things like git allows you to get clone

322
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,320
and just essentially create digital

323
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
replicas not only do you make a digital

324
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,920
replica of the code you make a digital

325
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,160
replica of the vulnerability as well

326
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,959
so

327
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,880
over the space of the last 20 years

328
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,800
we're fundamentally seeing new types of

329
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,040
problems occur as this amazing

330
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,240
technology transformation uh happens

331
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,760
um

332
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,000
what's also kind of worth reflecting on

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,639
is is a really fundamental change in in

334
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,720
oauth it was driven by jeff williams and

335
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,040
dave wickers who again you know names

336
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,639
were not on that previous list but have

337
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,079
massive contributions back into to owasp

338
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,720
is the wiki um when we started like i

339
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,560
said it was first a static website which

340
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,639
frankly incredibly hard for people to to

341
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,200
contribute to um and the minute that was

342
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,120
moved to a wiki all of a sudden we

343
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,000
democratized content contribution um

344
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
which made just a massive change into

345
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,160
the into the project so

346
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,320
there's been some some amazing amazing

347
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,720

as you can read reflecting on 20 years

366
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,200
of obas mad to see what had happened and

367
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,440
uh i can tell you just heartwarming

368
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,240
moments like that make you realize you

369
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,720
know what community really means and

370
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,920
what people when they come together um

371
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,800
do

372
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
the the wall street summit is one of the

373
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,320
funny ones um

374
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,240
in the early days i was actually in in

375
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,880
lower manhattan and wall street with a

376
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,839
fairly big name sears chief security

377
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,680
officer

378
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,959
he's still a

379
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,720
chief security officer a different

380
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,320
different company now

381
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,600
and uh

382
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
quite literally sat across the desk from

383
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,959
him um when he uh very confidently told

384
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,480
me that he was really the guy that was

385
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,000
behind all of o-wasp and all of its

386
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,199
content

387
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,720
and i was absolutely mind-boggled that

388
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,839
someone could could could say that um

389
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,760
and i tried to keep a straight face and

390
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,680
i um i swear i didn't keep a straight

391
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,040
face but

392
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,000
you hear all these crazy things um the

393
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,519
bottom one is a picture i was at in

394
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,880
singapore um where uh i had a had an

395
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,360
office a great team in my last company

396
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,800
and was talking i think it was hack in

397
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,399
the box which is uh which is a great

398
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,480
conference out there and afterwards a

399
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,079
guy came up to me and he said you don't

400
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,160
know who i am do you

401
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,800
and uh honestly i i didn't know who he

402
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,079
was um

403
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,240
and he said my name's jim i was like oh

404
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,399
great nice to meet you jim um and he

405
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,600
said my name is jim giovardi and i

406
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,000
recognized the name but frankly couldn't

407
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,839
think and he said i created the first

408
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,680
owasp logo

409
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
and sure enough the light bulb went off

410
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,399
and again a random guy um on the

411
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,160
internet when we decided we were trying

412
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,760
to figure out how to create a brand said

413
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,399
i'll do the brands i can do graphics and

414
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,480
and jim there is responsible for that

415
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,160
and i think you know whatever it was 15

416
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,600
years later

417
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,000
you uh you realize these connections of

418
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,120
people

419
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,000
um

420
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,079
the top right is my uh is my lovely

421
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,199
daughter hannah who is uh is now 18 and

422
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,519
she is off at university in the uk she's

423
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,959
reading law

424
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,480
and uh you know uh she's uh she's a high

425
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,160
functioning young lady she's a year

426
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,920
ahead of her time and

427
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,560
and living life to the full um at a uk

428
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,959
university which which typically means

429
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,360
drinking an awful lot and enjoying life

430
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,320
and

431
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,279
about four or five weeks ago

432
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,120
my wife and i came out of our u.s

433
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,959
citizenship swearing-in ceremony and i

434
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,880
turn on my phone and there's a whatsapp

435
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,399
message from hannah

436
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,600
and uh

437
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,440
it was pretty clear she was at a party

438
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,040
we'll leave it at that it was it was a

439
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,079
fairly garbage garbage text

440
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,560
but the gist of the text was is that she

441
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,399
was at a house party and i think it was

442
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,079
like 1 or 2 a.m

443
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,839
and she said there is a bunch of drunk

444
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,399
computer science guys that are hobbling

445
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,519
in the room

446
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,079
saying how oh wasp is absolutely stupid

447
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,240
and they're much much smarter than they

448
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,040
are

449
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,759
and i thought to myself oh my gosh like

450
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,720
you know for a law student halfway

451
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
around the world to be at a drunk

452
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,920
student party and for people to be

453
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,480
talking about oh wasp is is just quite

454
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,079
phenomenal for

455
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,599
for the impact that it has had

456
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,120
so

457
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,959
that's some interesting stories and

458
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,079
there are

459
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:16,959
many

460
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,399
many many more

461
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,079
of them

462
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,680
this is

463
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,839
a set of kind of comments that are

464
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,600
intended in the the best possible way um

465
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,440
they are not intended to be negative and

466
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,040
i just want to make sure that that's

467
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,920
that's um you know super clear um

468
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,480
they're intended to be kind of you know

469
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,360
constructive criticism and please take

470
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,839
it in in that way um because it is

471
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,160
interesting when you reflect back

472
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,000
and you know i

473
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,320
actively left oas been about 2006 2007.

474
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,079
and the reason i left is that when i

475
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,320
first started it my vision was is that

476
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,199
it would be a project for developers

477
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,320
um that we could provide guidance that

478
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,399
was really aimed at software developers

479
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,640
and that was kind of the authoritative

480
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
truth in software developers

481
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,039
i was very lucky when i was at microsoft

482
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,839
i on my corridor by my office was a guy

483
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,599
called ward cunningham and ward was the

484
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,520
guy who created the wiki if you're

485
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,959
familiar with with that he was a huge um

486
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,720
developer he was part of the agile

487
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,039
manifesto one of those people and ward

488
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,720
and i used to talk a lot frankly about

489
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
oh wasp and go for coffee and and and

490
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,120
what ward kind of shared and reflected

491
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,400
particularly about his patterns and

492
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,559
practices work is that

493
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,600
when a community forms then it tends to

494
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,799
swarm

495
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,880
and it tends to be

496
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,840
the collective uh direction

497
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,360
and you know he really kind of

498
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,039
encouraged me and said look you know you

499
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,600
can fight and you can swim upstream um

500
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,440
against this and you can really try and

501
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,160
make it become a developer community

502
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,919
but the reality is

503
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,240
what you probably need to do is to go go

504
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,880
go create another developer community

505
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,440
and try and attract a set of developers

506
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,120
versus a set of secure application

507
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,799
security people if you really want that

508
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,200
to happen people will tend to create

509
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,280
things to fulfill their own actions and

510
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,919
scratch their own itch

511
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,080
and that i think is true today and if

512
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,120
i'm critical um one of my things is that

513
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,280
i think that owasp hasn't fulfilled that

514
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,960
potential that i had that's not to say

515
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,520
it hasn't fulfilled massive impact as

516
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,039
as we all know

517
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,480
but i think it's fair to say that the

518
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,039
majority of people that come to oas bar

519
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,120
already security people

520
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,039
and i think that that's a little bit of

521
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,160
a shame

522
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,559
a big bit of a shame um

523
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,799
i went earlier and i typed in the word

524
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,880
secure coding guideline

525
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,520
and os was not on the front page of

526
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,080
google and when i clicked through

527
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,120
to the piece of content that was there

528
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,440
it had been created in 2010 and hadn't

529
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,039
been updated

530
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,039
and i think that's a real shame because

531
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,880
people look at o-wasp and there is

532
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,120
nothing out there on the internet today

533
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,760
we'll talk about that in a little bit um

534
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,280
but if i'm a developer and i type in

535
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,960
secure coding guidelines and i come to

536
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,240
something that hasn't been updated in

537
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
2010

538
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
i'm going to go elsewhere um

539
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,160
and that's a huge a huge missed

540
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,600
opportunity

541
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,520
i think over the years as well

542
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
osprez has really failed to partner

543
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,760
unfortunately with with big tech

544
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,000
so when i was at microsoft i ran i think

545
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,600
with msdn which was the microsoft

546
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,000
developer network and technet which is a

547
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,280
a way we would see developer tools to to

548
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,520
the market we had a million subscribers

549
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,679
you know 50 million page views a month

550
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,919
um and frankly had a very large budget

551
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,960
my

552
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,559
my business unit would generate more

553
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,760
than a billion dollars of revenue and so

554
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,280
there was an opportunity for me to help

555
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,880
our wasp and

556
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,760
i offered to figure out how to brokerage

557
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
for microsoft to get involved on a

558
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,080
deeper level you you watch large

559
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,919
technology companies

560
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,039
really lean in to helping amazing

561
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,280
communities and is is one of those

562
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,880
amazing communities

563
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,400
but unfortunately kind of what what

564
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,880
happened was that um i was really just

565
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,600
asked for a check um it wasn't a case of

566
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,360
hey let's go figure out we want to go

567
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,520
solve this problem together will you

568
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,840
fund it it was hey here's how you can

569
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,360
sponsor something

570
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,320
without anything tangible at the end

571
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,159
and i think the result of that is mean

572
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,760
is that oh us hasn't been able to

573
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
partner with big tech in the same way

574
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,080
that other things have and we'll talk

575
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,919
about the linux foundation cloud native

576
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,440
computing foundation

577
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,679
um and i think that those are some of

578
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,960
the missed opportunities that have

579
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,400
happened over the last 20 years that i

580
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,159
hope don't happen over the next the next

581
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,520
20.

582
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,360
um

583
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,679
i'll skip the bureaucracy slide but i

584
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,520
just make the comment you know there is

585
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,200
a reputation for for bureaucracy and

586
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,919
and i'm not sure that's super helpful um

587
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,320
i went to attend a local chapter meeting

588
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,600
once and was told that my slides

589
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,120
couldn't be on my own slide format that

590
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,640
had to be done on someone's powerpoint

591
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,000
format and

592
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,159
and things and you know for a community

593
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,400
project it's extremely important

594
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,520
that you know it's grassroots it's not a

595
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
a load of bureaucracy in order to get

596
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,120
things done um

597
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
and i know that um the leadership have

598
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
been working incredibly hard on that and

599
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,880
uh and that's fantastic but i encourage

600
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,400
you to kind of continue to do the same

601
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,600
because

602
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,960
it's got to be easy it's got to be

603
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,840
friction free to do it

604
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,640
one of the very first things that i did

605
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,039
was a step establish vendor neutrality

606
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,240
um

607
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,919
and frankly kind of before rappers had

608
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,600
beef on the internet i had beef with

609
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,919
someone around this and uh

610
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,320
you know um we won't name names but you

611
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,400
know what happened basically was that in

612
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,360
the early days someone said i want owasp

613
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,720
to mandate my product and the code was

614
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,799
indeed open source but it was gpl and

615
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,159
they were building a commercial company

616
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,960
on it and they wanted to to say that

617
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,520
this was the web app scanner

618
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,080
and frankly it was rubbish it was it was

619
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,720
not right um that is not vendor

620
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,000
neutrality

621
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
um and you know i i stuck my foot in it

622
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,440
like i said it caused you know

623
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,280
internet before whatever it is before

624
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,640
the term of internet beef and um

625
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,039
and and and it was really important and

626
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,400
i think the

627
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,559
vendor neutrality has been one of the

628
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,840
great things

629
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,320
i hope that that doesn't change um and i

630
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,039
hope that you know the relationship with

631
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,640
vendors doesn't change

632
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,320
but frankly i've attended some some

633
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,240
chapter meetings where

634
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,919
it's kind of like a timeshare pitch

635
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,640
before by a vendor um in return for for

636
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,440
free pizza um i think osp's better than

637
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,320
that there is an opportunity to truly

638
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,559
create vendor neutrality

639
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,880
and build a commercial model which

640
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,200
allows that big tech and those people to

641
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,799
engage um

642
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,120
and i hope that that is uh that that is

643
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,360
is done um

644
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,280
so that's that um i don't wanna don't

645
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,840
want to ponder on that i asked a bunch

646
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,080
of friends a bunch of people i know

647
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,880
to share what they think about oh wasp

648
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,320
and so i'm going to play you about five

649
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,799
minutes of of a video and i hope you

650
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,480
smile as much as i do watching these

651
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,400
hi i'm bruce schneier and i want to

652
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
congratulate oas on their 20th

653
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,919
anniversary

654
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,280
20 years ago application security was uh

655
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,520
kind of radical and a big deal

656
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,400
today it's common and i don't want to

657
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,520
underestimate the work that owasp did to

658
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,120
make that change

659
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,559
it's been great at being associated with

660
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,919
the organization

661
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,840
in the capacity i have been for the past

662
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,960
20 years

663
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,880
and i wish them

664
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,200
another 20 years i don't wish it was all

665
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
20 years of bad software security but

666
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,760

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,840
vulnerabilities to secure tomorrow and

709
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,200

hi i'm john villega author of the first

712
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,960
book on appsec and i was part of o

713
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,600
wasp's original technical board

714
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,760

715
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,520
dot dot dot

716
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,760
and honestly i've been continually

717
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,039
amazed by how huge an impact it's had

718
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,039
all across the industry it's been

719

amazing

720
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,760
so the day might not ever come where

721
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,320
appsec isn't needed anymore but if it

722
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,279
does

723
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,720

797
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,039
to say that web application security

798
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,799
would be in a significantly worse shape

799
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,399

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,000
you're smirking i can't see people um

834
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,799
as much as i am but uh you know i know

835
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,880
tom was smirking there but like that's

836
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,840
literally the founder of of github um

837
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,320
talking about the impact that owasp has

838
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,760
had

839
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,399
michael howard was the guy who created

840
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,039
the secure development life cycle at

841
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,799
microsoft when bill gates sent out the

842
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,080
famous mail

843
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
mike and dave leblanc wrote the writing

844
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,320
secure code book and they were behind

845
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
you know much of that stuff

846
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,480
jen easterly was nominated by president

847
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,360
biden and confirmed by the senate you

848
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,000
know to to to the um

849
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,080
the cyber uh security agency and

850
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,360
infrastructure agency chris why so paul

851
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,200
you know who is one of the nicest human

852
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,000
beings in the world um was you know was

853
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,399
one of the loft guys who testified in

854
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,760
front of congress that he could shut the

855
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,919
internet down in 30 seconds

856
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,880
um absolute freaking legend um you know

857
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,399
you got john villega who wrote the first

858
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,720
book on application security jack

859
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,360
daniels who started b-sides um you know

860
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,480
i uh

861
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,480
it's hard to it's hard to kind of

862
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,120
sometimes take a step back and realize

863
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
the impact of that when i sent bruce

864
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,480
schneier an email and immediately

865
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,919
responds back saying it would be an

866
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,960
honor to give a message to owasp you you

867
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,159
know the impact that it has had and uh i

868
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,360
just want to make sure that everyone

869
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,519
knows that because that is your work

870
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,039
that is the work that everyone has

871
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,760
contributed to has has that impact on

872
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,919
the project

873
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,159
um oh i'm restarting the slide i got to

874
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,760
figure out how to forward it versus do

875
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,880
that

876
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,919
okay so here's here's the final slide um

877
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,440
for for this and um

878
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
this is frankly is my wish for a wasp

879
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,320
and this is you know is is things that i

880
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,159
would love to see happen over the space

881
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,240
of the next 20 years

882
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,399
whether it does or not is is ultimately

883
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,159
down to the collective

884
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,279
but again what i hope is is that os will

885
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,679
have strong leadership because you know

886
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,519
back to the slide that i had of the

887
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,320
wasps pulling down the the statue

888
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,159
there's the old phrase that you know in

889
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,080
all the towns and all the cities there's

890
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,720
no statues celebrating committees

891
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,080
and if osp is to fulfill its potential

892
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,679
it's not going to do that through

893
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,480
committees um democracy is is a

894
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,960
wonderful thing but you have to have

895
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,720
democracy where someone sets out a

896
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,240
vision for something and everyone votes

897
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,519
for that vision

898
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,519
if you don't have that things will

899
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,200
essentially stay in a status quo and

900
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,799
that's been the truth throughout the

901
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,320
whole of history

902
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,799
um and there is a giant opportunity for

903
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,640
a wasp to really take itself to the next

904
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,880
step um and when i say next step of

905
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,720
course like look at what it's achieved

906
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,880
so far it's amazing i think uh andrew

907
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,399
vanderstock sent me some stats the other

908
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,679
day i think it was 130 150 thousand

909
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,880
people have attended or rsvp two events

910
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,720
since 2019.

911
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
um imagine imagine that i think there

912
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,960
have been three and a half or four

913
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,720
thousand events since since that time um

914
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,399
it's a huge huge

915
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,760
um input and huge huge accomplishment

916
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,399
but i think that we are faced at a

917
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,279
precipice of where things are changing

918
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,960
you you heard at the beginning how

919
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
technology has has changed over the

920
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,039
space of the last 20 years

921
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,720
and uh and someone once said to me you

922
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
know what do you have any regrets about

923
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,640
oh wasp and one of them is calling it oh

924
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,799
wasp right wasp was an amazing catchy

925
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,880
name and it was probably partly you know

926
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,039
judah judah

927
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,559
making it memorable

928
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,000
but the the web

929
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,720
is is not uh you know it's not really

930
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,399
the focus of a lot of application

931
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,480
security today we are

932
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,880
sat here in essentially the second

933
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,440
generation of of cloud

934
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,279
the cloud vendors

935
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,480
um are being commoditized themselves by

936
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,559
the big data companies like snowflake

937
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,039
like databricks cloudera

938
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,120
and they are building on infrastructure

939
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,679
we see companies like netflix uh sorry

940
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,440
like netlify

941
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,840
you know basically create a full

942
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,919
end-to-end developer suite

943
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,039
on top again on top of cloud services

944
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,159
and so you are really in the early

945
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,399
stages of cloud 2.0

946
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,960
and who knows maybe it is not azure it

947
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,679
is not aws it is not google cloud

948
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,440
they'll come out of the winners out of

949
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,000
that snowflake is i think worth about 60

950
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,519
billion dollars right now and it's

951
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,720
essentially a

952
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,880
you know data data lake data warehouse

953
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,719
build on top of the cloud infrastructure

954
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,399
to make that data available to

955
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,159
application developers

956
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,199
so

957
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,560
i think it's really important that oauth

958
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,839
takes a look at that takes a look at

959
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,839
what's happened over the last 20 years

960
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,440
and ensures that it is 100 relevant for

961
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,599
what is about to happen in terms of that

962
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,199
industry

963
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,679
you will see things like machine

964
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,520
learning that become absolutely

965
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,760
prevalent and are all reliant on

966
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
software security we've seen attacks

967
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,280
cross-site scripting all of these sql

968
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,719
injection things

969
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,679
but imagine if we wind up with an era of

970
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,599
what are often referred to as salami

971
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,520
attacks when machine learning where

972
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
essentially machine learning our

973
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,760
machine learning algorithms all give

974
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,440
slightly different results each time and

975
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,719
they're slightly biased towards

976
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,760
something

977
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,399
we could see catastrophic problems with

978
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,239
with things like that and application

979
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,720
security has a massive space to play

980
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,320
whether it's through things like formal

981
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,240
methods whether it's you know big data

982
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,119
statistical analysis or you know just

983
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,960
looking at machine learning models and

984
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
all of those things themselves

985
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,200
they are all application security

986
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,440
problems that um i don't really see

987
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,520
people kind of looking at today

988
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,640
cryptocurrency ransomware like it's all

989
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,119
driven by software and

990
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,640
there's going to be massive things that

991
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,040
os needs to needs to provide leadership

992
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,280
around that

993
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
the next one is is that you know

994
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,400
communities are developing in very very

995
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,079
complex ways and it's absolute scale

996
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,520
and there's an opportunity for oauth

997
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,040
today to basically partner or

998
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,800
essentially join with the linux

999
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,160
foundation and the cloud native

1000
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,680
computing foundation

1001
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,079
and i hope that it does um

1002
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,560
that has been going for a long time and

1003
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,359
if you are proud of the os

1004
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,160
reach as as very well you should be

1005
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,560
you can look up to that foundation as

1006
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,000
having you know a step function up um 40

1007
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,160
000 people go to conferences you know

1008
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,640
hundreds of million millions of dollars

1009
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,200
flow through through that foundation

1010
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,040
and you know we can look at places like

1011
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,520
apache we can look at places like the

1012
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,359
cloud native computing foundation where

1013
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,320
node joined the node foundation joined

1014
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,079
we have kubernetes over there we have

1015
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,240
you know hyperledger it's some of the

1016
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,560
world's most important cloud software

1017
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,079
and the linux foundation would really

1018
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,079
like oauth to embrace that to lead the

1019
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,240
application security part for all of

1020
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,520
that software

1021
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,320
and that's a huge opportunity for owasp

1022
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,800
to take the next level and you know

1023
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,200
essentially step up onto the world's um

1024
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,359
the world's tech stage and and go help

1025
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,920
drive the securing of that

1026
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,720
and i don't think that that conflicts

1027
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,880
with anything around the fundamental

1028
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,800
beliefs that owasp has around vendor

1029
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,040
neutrality about things being open to

1030
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,079
all

1031
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,880
but it is a change in the model it is in

1032
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
some ways a top-down model versus a

1033
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,480
bottoms-up model it's not relying on

1034
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,480
individuals to contribute but it's

1035
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,720
reliant on vendors and big tech to

1036
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,760
contribute

1037
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,680
but the impact that some of those

1038
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,359
organizations have had has been

1039
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,359
absolutely tremendous and the

1040
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,119
opportunity and the reputation the great

1041
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,200
work that olas has done allows you to

1042
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,960
step into that plate

1043
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,800
um and uh and frankly i've been trying

1044
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,280
to help broker that uh that to happen um

1045
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,040
or at least for it to be taken seriously

1046
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,839
and

1047
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,680
and i think it's really important that

1048
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,079
everyone understands that um you'll also

1049
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,000
see the source lab sign down there um i

1050
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,640
know you heard from justin dawley who uh

1051
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,960
csuf source labs former cso vmware and

1052
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,440
servicenow and other great companies and

1053
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,280
source labs are building on the oauth

1054
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,359
zap project which is an amazing an

1055
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,000
amazing project

1056
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,480
but if we look at you know the

1057
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,640
opportunity to essentially create an

1058
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,640
end-to-end tool stack on what oasp has

1059
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,280
built there really isn't a model there's

1060
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,680
no commercial model again around for

1061
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,760
that amazing software that gets built

1062
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
to figure out how to partner with those

1063
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,040
vendors and have those vendors

1064
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,359
contribute back and everyone drives

1065
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,119
drives further forward

1066
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,200
i think if owasp had a chief pri chief

1067
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
product officer um

1068
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,720
which really is just a fancy way of

1069
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,839
saying someone who owns product

1070
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,680
management engineering and you know and

1071
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,599
test and all those functions

1072
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,280
that could pull together all of the

1073
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,440
tools into a cohesive suite

1074
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,160
os could quite literally have the best

1075
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,800
end-to-end security suite for

1076
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,880
application security in the world um

1077
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,560
there is no doubt about that you have

1078
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,800
dependency track this you know

1079
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,720
jeremy long and steve springer an

1080
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,119
amazing you know project we have you

1081
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,359
know zap you know simon bennett's the

1082
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,320
most amazing project and loads and loads

1083
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,839
of others but they all work

1084
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,280
independently right they haven't been

1085
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,119
pulled together into into a suite of

1086
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,119
tools and you know you saw you saw

1087
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,760
thomas uh the founder of github like

1088
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,000
the relationships

1089
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,920
through people like me and other people

1090
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,520
to get into the

1091
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,119
the the right people at the industry to

1092
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,400
make these happen

1093
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,920
could really get owasp tools in front of

1094
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,320
developers and making massive amounts of

1095
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,920
difference along with things like

1096
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,160
getting into kubernetes and and all of

1097
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,359
these great things so there's huge

1098
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,960
opportunity there and i hope that owes

1099
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,400
takes that that opportunity

1100
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,280
um i think that um the last thing is is

1101
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,599
that i hope owasp um you know becomes

1102
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,240
the guardians of the galaxy and as well

1103
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,480
as all of these projects that are going

1104
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,599
on

1105
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,760
get some momentum behind fixing things

1106
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,839
um i know there are odd sporadic things

1107
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,119
happening but

1108
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,720
you know frankly i was in i was in

1109
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,680
sydney in australia um meeting with uh

1110
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,520
with the head of the apache foundation

1111
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,119
just when the big apache struts thing

1112
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,560
kicked him

1113
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,320
and what struck us over a cup of coffee

1114
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,520
and frankly one of one of the most

1115
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,359
frustrating things for me was that

1116
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,640
you've got a whole bunch of amazing

1117
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,800
security people he had a whole bunch of

1118
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,920
a bunch of legacy problems in in struts

1119
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,000
and the two people weren't together

1120
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,280
and i think that there's a huge

1121
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,880
opportunity to mobilize these people you

1122
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,119
with an amazing skill an amazing skill

1123
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,800
set amazing knowledge

1124
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,320
that when these problems occur in

1125
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,240
critical infrastructure and all these

1126
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,839
these these software projects that are

1127
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,960
powering the world to secure them

1128
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,720
not just keep creating guidance for for

1129
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,400
other people but jump in and go do the

1130
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,319
work um because you can essentially

1131
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,560
become the world's force of going and

1132
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,640
fixing those those things and i think

1133
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,079
there's there's there's an amazing

1134
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,280
opportunity for us to go do that

1135
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,960
so that's that um i have a final you

1136
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,560
know set of things that i would like to

1137
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,480
say which is that

1138
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,800
you know from starting oasp um i

1139
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,400
encourage everyone to go take a risk

1140
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,440
right

1141
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,079
things don't feel comfortable um when

1142
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,359
you go do it but you've seen what

1143
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,960
happens when i wasn't comfortable and

1144
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,640
just yeah you know

1145
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,720
who gives a crap what anyone else thinks

1146
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,680
go make a change um there is a massive

1147
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,760
opportunity ahead of olwas to go to go

1148
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,319
make that change um and i hope that that

1149
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,960
you guys take that risk um dream big you

1150
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,880
can see what happens from some you know

1151
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,440
silly idea and small thing and a mailing

1152
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,240
list um don't take no for an answer just

1153
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,440
drive through you've got to have

1154
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,880
conviction in how you do things um

1155
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,640
you know there is this this phrase is

1156
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,880
that um you know and and i know this has

1157
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,800
been prolific at microsoft in other

1158
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,240
places that if you don't cannibalize

1159
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,520
yourself someone else is going to

1160
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,880
cannibalize you

1161
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,319
software security as you heard from

1162
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,480
bruce schneier and everyone else is is

1163
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,560
is one of the most critical things that

1164
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,800
we're we're all faced with today and so

1165
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,720
it's top of mind it's not a niche

1166
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,400
anymore um and you know it is absolutely

1167
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,560
critical for for governments for big

1168
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
tech company you know high-tech

1169
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,880
companies and everyone else to go solve

1170
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,880
um and i hope that our stays at the the

1171
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,480
center of that but that will mean

1172
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,079
reinventing itself

1173
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,920
um and that will mean you know figuring

1174
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,520
out how to adapt

1175
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,480
um

1176
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,640
the last thing is is that you know

1177
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,520
i have met some amazing people you saw

1178
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,920
that message from dan cuthbert sharif

1179
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,760
andrew van der stock there are just

1180
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,640
people that are just fantastic humans

1181
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,400
and uh it doesn't mean to say you can't

1182
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,079
have uh have conflict there's been loads

1183
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,040
of conflict with owasp over the time um

1184
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,359
from my sort of early beef to lots of

1185
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,880
other things that have that have

1186
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,480
happened um

1187
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,560
but you know everyone

1188
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,640
that i've seen treats everyone else is

1189
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,359
great humans with with great respect and

1190
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,359
and i think that is absolutely fantastic

1191
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,440
for for a community to do that it

1192
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,040
genuinely feels like a community and

1193
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,400
when you hear sharif

1194
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
you know turn to to someone that he met

1195
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,160
through oas to talk about a potential

1196
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,160
cancer situation which thankfully wasn't

1197
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,280
wasn't the

1198
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,920
the case um for sharif like you really

1199
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,960
do understand how how good humanity and

1200
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
and just being good to each other

1201
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,599
matters and um and when you do that i

1202
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,800
just want to encourage everyone to kind

1203
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,040
of constantly think about that

1204
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,960
you know life's too short not to do not

1205
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,800
to do great things i know us frankly as

1206
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,920
amazing and and as you've seen from uh

1207
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,680
from all of the work that it's achieved

1208
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,520
and the the credits from just those

1209
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,240
those people in the industry

1210
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,520
congratulations i don't think i can say

1211
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,359
anything else um the achievement has

1212
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,359
been amazing and uh

1213
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,640
whether it's 10 years or 20 years i look

1214
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,480
forward to coming back and uh and

1215
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,839
talking again and watching the continued

1216
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,119
progress so thank you for listening i

1217
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,680
will stop sharing my screen now and

1218
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,720
i think we'll take questions

1219
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,160
thank you for that mark um so while we

1220
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,599
wait for some questions i have some

1221
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,839
questions prepared for you

1222
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,920
early on towards your closing you you

1223
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,200
alluded to

1224
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,160
going back 20 years you may have not

1225
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,319
named it oas it was it was catchy but

1226
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,920
we're not doing a ton of web work these

1227
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,040
days

1228
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,319
there's a lot of work we have going on

1229
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,040
with with iot in the cloud what would

1230
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,760
you have named it oh i'm i am not a

1231
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,599
marketing guy achieving i am not a

1232
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,359
marketing guy but i have thought about

1233
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,440
it it will probably be called the code

1234
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,200
security project

1235
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,720
so if we think about infrastructure as

1236
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,040
code you know today

1237
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,200
whether it's mobile whether it's you

1238
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,000
know whatever it is code is is thematic

1239
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,480
through it all i think that the

1240
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,839
the nature of code has gone from

1241
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,440
crafting everything to be an individual

1242
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,079
to in many ways consuming open source

1243
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,640
consuming apis or you know defining

1244
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,359
infrastructure so um that has been the

1245
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,599
the constant theme throughout it so my

1246
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,760
suspicion is it would be that but uh i

1247
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,839
am not the right guy to do branding

1248
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,000
unfortunately well no fortunately i'm

1249
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,480
not the right person to do branding

1250
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,880
no that's perfect um yeah this is a fun

1251
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,119
conversation to have in every chapter

1252
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,440
meeting is it comes up at least once and

1253
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,880
in any chapter meeting you go to

1254
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,560
somebody's trying to rename olaf's

1255
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,480
because we do so much more than web

1256
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,160
application security

1257
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,839
um the other thing is

1258
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,359
you know you talked about the next 20

1259
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,640
years and and the the future of hawas

1260
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,240
you know if you were to and i know i'm

1261
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,760
asking you right on the spot but if you

1262
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,280
were to come up with a mission statement

1263
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,880
for the next 20 years what would that

1264
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,800
sound like

1265
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,880
i i think it's pretty simple i think

1266
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,160
it's secure the world software

1267
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,920
that's great

1268
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,079
um yeah i mean

1269
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,880
like i said about you know um

1270
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,800
the opportunity with cloud native

1271
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,520
computing and things like that's where

1272
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,680
kubernetes is that's where

1273
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,040
you know the world's most important

1274
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,359
software projects like noda

1275
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,680
and you know when and that's you know

1276
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,680
where where google and microsoft and all

1277
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,440
of the major tech people are you know

1278
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,359
are basically putting massive amounts of

1279
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,520
money and massive resources into and

1280
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,280
those guys want you guys

1281
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,119
to go secure that stuff they want you to

1282
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,640
be the leaders in application security

1283
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,160
and secure that stuff and i think that's

1284
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,560
just a huge opportunity to literally

1285
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,240
secure the world's most important

1286
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
software and uh

1287
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,000
and yeah so huge opportunities to go do

1288
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,680
it

1289
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,040
thanks for that mark

1290
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,160
um so so one one kind of broad question

1291
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,800
if you're coming back in 20 years

1292
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,240
and

1293
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,000
you you have some you have obviously you

1294
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,839
have a view into the industry you see

1295
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,240
how security is going you've seen oaas

1296
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,200
mature and evolve over the years

1297
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,560
you you've already talked about some of

1298
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,800
the things that wasp should do to be

1299
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,960
successful in the next 20 years what are

1300
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,119
some of the things that should not do to

1301
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,839
be successful in the next 20 years

1302
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:10,560
well

1303
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,680
it doesn't matter what you do you're

1304
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,680
going to be successful

1305
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,599
that's that's the reality of it right i

1306
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,119
think you could be you know some people

1307
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,480
are going to be more successful than

1308
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,560
others but um you know if you surround

1309
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,000
yourself by great people you'll always

1310
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,839
be successful and i was surrounded by

1311
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,160
great people so you know whichever path

1312
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,880
owasp takes um it's gonna be absolutely

1313
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,800
great and and i'm sure you know if i if

1314
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,640
i i'm lucky enough to be invited back in

1315
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,680
20 years it'll it'll be it'll be amazing

1316
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,920
i think that um

1317
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,480
my personal take is you know if you if

1318
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,480
you're a developer and you rock up to os

1319
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,200
it's pretty hard to to navigate right

1320
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,200
there is ten of everything

1321
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,000
and um you know um someone once referred

1322
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,200
to it and this is not my words but

1323
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,800
someone wants to refer to it as the junk

1324
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,319
drawer security

1325
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,640
and you know there are projects around

1326
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,200
drones and you know everything but like

1327
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,040
i said if you go type in secure coding

1328
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,280
guidelines into into google you know

1329
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,960
it's a document that's 10 years old and

1330
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,520
if you think about the user experience

1331
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,040
of a developer trying to find how to

1332
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,400
solve a problem you know that is um is

1333
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,160
is a tough place to be

1334
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,839
so my hope is if you look at things you

1335
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,119
know look at at another set of projects

1336
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,760
maybe cncf maybe apache where you see

1337
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,440
absolute critical infrastructure over

1338
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,160
there

1339
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,520
is that there are very clear you know

1340
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,440
top level projects and i know osp has

1341
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,280
this it has you know flagship projects

1342
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,280
and other projects but like i said i

1343
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,720
think that there's the opportunity to

1344
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,319
have static analysis i asked dast you

1345
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,240
know all working in a suite of tools

1346
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,160
that work with github that work with

1347
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,119
gitlab that run nci cd pipelines and

1348
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,040
developers can come and and frankly i

1349
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,960
also hope that os turns into being a sas

1350
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,599
provider like why those things can't be

1351
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,520
provided up there you have dependency

1352
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,160
check like you know and again thinking

1353
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,920
big like why don't you guys become the

1354
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,599
distributor for open source libraries

1355
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,280
and secure open source libraries clean

1356
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,040
them let developers go pull clean ones

1357
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,680
let them pull the profiles out of it um

1358
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,160
people will fund that and uh i know

1359
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,680
people that will fund it

1360
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,440
um so you know if you guys want to

1361
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,880
figure out how to go do it i'll broker

1362
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,400
the conversations for people to do it

1363
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,319
because it's critical work that happens

1364
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,800
on the internet right and so you know my

1365
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800
hope is those type of evolutions happen

1366
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,000
versus thousands of more you know small

1367
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,520
small projects

1368
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,760
right and is that what you is that what

1369
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,119
you meant when you said go build it

1370
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,800
secure through oas

1371
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,359
basically collecting curating fixing

1372
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,040
these these critical allow open source

1373
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,040
libraries these frameworks into

1374
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,200
something usable as we were going with

1375
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,000
that

1376
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,280
i i mean look the the the beauty about

1377
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,160
reusable software um is that you know

1378
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,079
you get to replicate it the downside is

1379
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,000
you replicate vulnerabilities

1380
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,160
and so you know when you look at things

1381
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,920
like i said about when that big struts

1382
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,400
problem happened or you know you've got

1383
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,079
software like kubernetes which you know

1384
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,960
frankly everyone is is running um

1385
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,040
you know and and and big open source

1386
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,760
databases why not go and secure those

1387
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,520
things we've seen bug bounties right

1388
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,040
where you know people are doing that for

1389
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,160
money but you've got some of the most

1390
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,680
talented people here

1391
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,599
go fix those things in code right go

1392
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,079
watch the commits there are open source

1393
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,000
projects where developers are moving

1394
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,520
incredibly fast and there is the

1395
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,160
opportunity for essentially the world

1396
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,079
security team this isn't a security team

1397
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,160
inside of a commercial company but go

1398
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,920
partner with all those big open source

1399
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,839
projects and and and fix them and secure

1400
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,520
them you've got i think adam shaw stacks

1401
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,119
on right you got you know people that

1402
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,520
basically invented threat modeling

1403
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,119
go teach those things

1404
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,359
you have all of the pieces to go to go

1405
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,119
do it and uh but i think it's kind of a

1406
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,800
matter of collectively getting getting

1407
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,240
those things and i'm focusing on a few

1408
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,240
small things right it's like build the

1409
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,319
world's best security tool tool chain

1410
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,920
right figure out how to go do those

1411
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,559
things that it's it's all there

1412
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,079
yeah i totally get it it's quite

1413
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,280
frightening when you go to install

1414
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,200
something in node and says pull down 3

1415
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,680
000 packages you're like oh boy

1416
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,280
hopefully somebody's reviewed those 3000

1417
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,200
packages of course and we and we know

1418
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,960
that they do right of course they don't

1419
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,640
right like i said they were you know we

1420
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,880
we did that that worked with uh with a

1421
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,160
couple of the agencies there's about a

1422
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,760
quarter of a million you know

1423
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,040
vulnerabilities that are in there and

1424
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,640
you heard steve christie say you know

1425
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,040
osp's a curse and a blessing right

1426
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,319
so you know um yeah it's a it's a it's a

1427
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,920
mass problem that needs to be needs to

1428
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,359
be addressed you guys could step up and

1429
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:26,720
do it

1430
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,200
awesome well i'm very motivated now mark

1431
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,880
thank you so much for this thank you for

1432
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,559
your time and and we'll give someone

1433
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,160
some people some breaks and and we'll be

1434
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,359
back in a bit

1435
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:40,279
great thank you very much thank you mark
