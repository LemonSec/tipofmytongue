00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,030
[Music]

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,559
since we submitted this call for papers

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,799
uh denim group got acquired by coal fire

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,719
so i'm now a vice president coal fire

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,800
along with dan cornell

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
if you heard him earlier in the day

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,320
sedan and i were the two two the

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,480
principals that came over as part of

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,560
that acquisition uh the other thing is

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,519
i'm proud to say that uh dan and i were

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,519
i think at the first real big oaus

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,719
meeting in new york i want to say

13
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:34,239
2005-ish with mark curfey and jeff

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,320
williams and all those so we've been

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,520
i mean serial volunteers for

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,160
owasp for a decade plus and friends with

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,000
people all over the world including oas

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
folks so we'll get started here if you

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,719
don't mind i'll jump in and great thank

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,360
you uh so so the interesting story here

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,320
is

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,160
uh probably about a month or two into

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,480
the pandemic last year

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,079
uh we're trying to find interesting

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,079
things to do we just rolled off of rsa

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,239
which was pretty shaky and you know

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,960
pandemic became real i think

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,040
uh black hat had just been canceled we

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
really didn't know about the future and

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,479
we were kind of trying to come up with a

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,760
cool idea

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
uh that would be fun for research and

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,720
the topic of appsec champions came up

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,799
and what ended up being happening was

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,720
about a nine month to a year journey to

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,600
create

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,360
a a huge

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,520
survey and survey

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,439
a series of companies and organizations

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,880
that were doing abstract champions

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,600
particularly well and what we recognized

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,439
was although there have been a lot of

43
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,759
programs out there a lot of speaking at

44
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,520
oasis events nobody had ever really

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,880
quantified

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,600
uh certain common attributes or emerging

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,159
practices or even best practices uh that

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,079
there was it was largely uh you know

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,840
there's a little bit here and there but

50
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,560
this was an effort to quantify

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,119
that across some of the major companies

52
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,960
that we know and so we started this

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,479
really in earnest in april of may of

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,079
last year it took the better part of

55
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,200
last year

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,119
we finished it this spring and then coal

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,719
fire asked to

58
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,840
uh to to delay this

59
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,440
because they wanted to publish it and

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,878
make a big deal out of it which they're

61
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,760
doing next month so you are all getting

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,160
the first glimpse of these numbers as

63
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,959
part of this absence champion survey and

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,640
the results and kind of recommendations

65
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,160
out of it so there's numbers associated

66
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,480
with this but some some certain cool

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,879
things that you will come to find out

68
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,200
are you know will help you this is me

69
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
again i won't talk about me except for

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,680
i've been in apsec forever with dan and

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,440
others and uh

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,319
and and really helps says those and csos

73
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,720
work with uh applications security

74
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,519
programs to build them uh and so part of

75
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,080
this idea about this survey came out of

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,200
that that we noticed that there was

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
these champion programs everywhere you

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,720
know i think the one of the first ones

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,519
was

80
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,760
uh what brad arkham did way back at

81
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,920
adobe with the ninjas and so we started

82
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,360
to see these things come up in different

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,720
world ways

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,800
that was the thing that we that was a

85
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,120
genesis this idea we'd seen him they've

86
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,599
been a thing as a consultant

87
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,440
you get to see lots of client

88
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,640
environments and we saw that these

89
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,560
things were everywhere but

90
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,800
nobody had really done any quantitative

91
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
analysis of it so that was the thought

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,280
here

93
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,000
so

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,519
given the limitation of time i'm going

95
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,440
to try to blast through this i won't do

96
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,400
any justice to it uh numbers-wise but

97
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,120
again i am publishing the numbers uh

98
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,200
this next month which is really just i

99
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,560
guess a week from now now so we're

100
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,239
coming that's coming up i'll talk about

101
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,720
the i'll give you a sense of what we did

102
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,519
to

103
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,519
for the survey itself

104
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,840
the questions specific questions

105
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,560
the results and then allow some time to

106
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,720
formulate questions in the slack so

107
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,080
because the way the format is it won't

108
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,599
be interactive it'll be interactive on

109
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,480
slack

110
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,959
i'll try to take the time that i have

111
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,599
to go through this in a meaningful way

112
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,599
but the for the starting point for this

113
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,439
was we did what's called a structured

114
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,799
research approach and what does that

115
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
mean it means that we knew that there

116
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,640
were certain questions that lent

117
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,879
themselves to some form of quantitative

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,040
analysis you know numbers and there's

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,239
other ones that we wanted to ask

120
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,400
questions and have follow-up questions

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,560
and be able to kind of do

122
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,400
a little bit uh you know more

123
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,120
interactive research but at least have

124
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,880
data in a somewhat structured way where

125
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,478
we can make some sense out of it so it's

126
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,880
not just a narrative so it looked less

127
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,440
like a survey monkey

128
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,639
form and it looked a little bit more

129
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,199
like a focus group as we started to say

130
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,639
and of course

131
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,440
i had to go and ask people for time

132
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,880
during the first few months of a

133
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
pandemic where everyone had an excuse

134
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,520
not to do this so this was all done via

135
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,880
zoom and it uh ended up being

136
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,440
you know like i said an exercise a labor

137
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,120
love but also an exercise in learning a

138
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,440
bunch about uh surveys

139
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,280
my background is i'm a political science

140
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,759
as an undergraduate an mba type so i'm

141
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,320
used to uh you know doing quantitative

142
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,400
research around surveys that's a little

143
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,639
bit of background i'm an absolute guy so

144
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,479
our goal was to capture

145
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,199
best practices or probably better said

146
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,639
emerging practices what are the

147
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,280
commonalities across programs what were

148
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,639
the kind of things that jumped out and

149
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,280
again we started with some hypotheses

150
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,000
um and and based upon anecdote and the

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,320
joke is if you have two anecdotes you

152
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,400
have data you know so we kind of came

153
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,639
from that and had fairly modest

154
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,160
expectations going in we also wanted to

155
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
identify some of the common challenges

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,240
and attributes you know around these

157
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,440
programs

158
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,680
uh including the environments so like

159
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,240
you know given this transition from a

160
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
very much on-prem and kind of web app

161
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,080
world to a much more different

162
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,600
application world

163
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
what were what were what were what were

164
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,160
the developers practicing are building

165
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,320
and what were the apps like people uh

166
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,759
trying to measure

167
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,840
so what we did is we work with

168
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,960
a series of companies and i had to you

169
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,880
know target the folks so anybody that

170
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,360
was a program owner self-identified as

171
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,680
an absolute person you know or security

172
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,240
architect that did application security

173
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,319
i didn't really interview uh you know

174
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,720
trainers per se or network folks or

175
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,319
scissors it was people that were you

176
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,000
know ospi's smes oaas folks uh folks

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,360
that knew and had worked with or started

178
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
application security champions programs

179
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,199
within their organization so a fairly

180
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,639
narrow universe

181
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,120
and we focused on that group and what i

182
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,960
ended up doing is i you know first of

183
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,120
all i had to sell them on participation

184
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,560
and believe it or not in this day and

185
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,080
age about a third of the companies we

186
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,000
talked to said look i'm either precluded

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,919
from doing it my boss doesn't support it

188
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,160
don't care we're in a pandemic can't

189
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
share information so i mean this was a

190
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,400
the recruitment of people to participate

191
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,039
and the level effort was actually quite

192
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
ambitious we ended up doing two or three

193
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,840
interviews one to sell them on the idea

194
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,800
secondly to gather data validate data

195
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,240
and the value that for them to

196
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,160
participate was

197
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,720
uh comparative data uh that we could say

198
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,400
well look this is where what you

199
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,960
responded to and this is where everybody

200
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,400
else came in so there's a little bit of

201
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,039
that think of sam or bison as examples

202
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,000
but just in this narrow scope of

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,960
champions and the uh the result is this

204
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,120
report and the data that's coming out

205
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,440
next month so again labor of love it

206
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,479
took uh the better part of well now over

207
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,720
a year given the embargo and all that in

208
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,880
the pandemic but it's pretty cool stuff

209
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,000
and i think will also be a launching off

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,759
point for further analysis and hopefully

211
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,319
inspire others i'd say the broadest goal

212
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,440
of this was to up the art of application

213
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,280
security was to provide people in the

214
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,639
field

215
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,319
with with more ammo to push their

216
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
initiatives to push

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,919
appsec programs to give a little bit

218
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,599
more meat to the bones so that was

219
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,120
really it so that we could look back and

220
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,319
say this went from a thing that was kind

221
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,759
of just happened organically in the

222
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,800
field to a more organized and structured

223
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,560
thing interesting enough if you talk to

224
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
the analysts of the world the gardeners

225
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
the boards of the of the world they

226
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,000
don't they don't really focus on this

227
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,919
they focus on technology stuff

228
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,680
technology solutions as far as process

229
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,599
they do you bring up absolute champions

230
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,280
and other process stuff they just kind

231
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,240
of don't care uh for the whole story

232
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,199
behind that but the net of it is we

233
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,960
again saw this everywhere so we want to

234
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,520
bring this up as a and all the absent

235
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,199
folks that we work with all the good

236
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,199
programs had one so that's the other

237
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,960
thing virtually every good program that

238
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,639
we work with in the field

239
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,160
had a champions program so we knew

240
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,360
there's something there

241
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,240
so

242
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,839
but looking for the candidates end up

243
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,519
being a big effort i took you know

244
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,599
full-time apps up staff

245
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,479
uh and we ended up with 26 companies it

246
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,080
was interesting because

247
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,159
uh we ended up i started i think i start

248
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,600
with 60 plus

249
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,760
and there's probably about 10 of them

250
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,360
who were going through the process and

251
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
interviewing them and starting to kind

252
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,200
of uh for better for lack of a better

253
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,959
term qualify them

254
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,959
and we realized that really what they

255
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,040
had was an apsec training program a

256
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,880
developer training program so really

257
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,560
what this what we were talking about

258
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
here specifically is

259
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,320
an app stick champions program i i think

260
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,279
if you're an awesome person you

261
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,959
understand what this is but for the lay

262
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,000
people the definition is the use of a s

263
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,560
of an asset team that has very little

264
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,240
managerial control

265
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,040
uh

266
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,640
influencing and and driving the apsec

267
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,360
uh practices and behaviors to a much

268
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,120
larger development team that they have

269
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,600
very little span of control over so the

270
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,200
concept of lack of managerial control uh

271
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,480
influence

272
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,160
and then the sheer numbers what we knew

273
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,800
from anecdote was you know most abstract

274
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,959
programs had a few folks the bigger ones

275
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,640
have lots of folks but there was always

276
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,880
this number mismatch so you'd have five

277
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,760
people and 100 or a thousand developers

278
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,600
so that was that was the starting point

279
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,120
so we looked we ended up having and

280
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,519
working with 26 companies

281
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,040
and and

282
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,320
back and forth and back and forth they

283
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,959
represent some of the best programs in

284
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,399
some of the better companies so right

285
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,640
off the bat there's sample bias which

286
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,200
you know i'll fully acknowledge that but

287
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,880
what we did want to do is we didn't want

288
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,399
to work with companies that had no

289
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,079
program you know because they put big

290
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,360
zeros or

291
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,720
you know that they weren't really

292
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,880
building software they were licensing it

293
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,519
from the jack henry's of the you know or

294
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,800
the five servers of the world it was

295
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,320
really people that built software and

296
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,079
you know had had were big enough where

297
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,720
they had an absent person you know or

298
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
people you know so that was kind of a

299
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,279
qualifying event as it turned out more

300
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,160
than 50 of the companies had more than

301
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,000
10 000 votes in them so these were this

302
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,480
is largely the domain of the larger

303
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,519
companies

304
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,279
the smaller companies were probably more

305
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,600
like the fintech or the sas platform

306
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,519
folks it's still they made it from a

307
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,200
head count standpoint been a thousand or

308
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,320
two thousand

309
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,720
but they you know they're a sas banking

310
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,360
platform so they had a lot of focus on

311
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,959
uh that particular you know they had to

312
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,680
focus on absence so uh but but the big

313
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,760
enterprises not an smb or small

314
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,519
medium-sized business play

315
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,320
uh

316
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
you know and and so that was that was

317
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,360
the the the attributes of the companies

318
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,640
was important

319
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,880
so the questions themselves and i had i

320
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,560
think at one point about 20 plus

321
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,839
questions um and i and some of which

322
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,079
most of them followed the hypothesis

323
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,360
some of them

324
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,959
were interesting others ones were

325
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,720
uninteresting i'll talk to the results

326
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,399
but the first thing i wanted to

327
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,399
determine what you know a little bit of

328
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,720
organizational background because i

329
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,560
could infer certain things about the

330
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,160
attributes of the program based on the

331
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,560
background and then some trade-offs

332
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,360
around sophistication and around uh you

333
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,880
know practices so the first thing i

334
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,640
looked at is i just asked basic

335
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,079
questions you know how many devs do you

336
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,760
have how many appsec

337
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,000
full-time appsec people do you have what

338
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,959
regardless if they're ftes like uh you

339
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,360
know contractors i don't care i just

340
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,880
want to know how many that are

341
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,480
functioning in that role and there's

342
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,720
some discretion there of collection and

343
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,880
we kind of went back and forth on that

344
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,160
and then kind of how many apps of

345
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,959
champions you know and and the the

346
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,040
primary inputs for that were

347
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,120
ended up being uninteresting but the

348
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,360
derivation and the results from uh

349
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,040
comparing those became more interesting

350
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,519
i'll talk about that the maturity as

351
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,880
self-identified along a a broad cmmi

352
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,360
inspired scale you know kind of the

353
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,240
environments versus you know a cloud how

354
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
many of them had pipelines

355
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,480
you know some of this stuff was to to

356
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,399
grab gather information broadly and then

357
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,320
from there look at trend lines see if

358
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,440
any uh key findings came out and as luck

359
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,360
would have it some did

360
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,680
how long did it take these appsec

361
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,519
managers or these security managers to

362
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,519
build the programs and how long had they

363
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,720
been in place

364
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,160
what were the attributes of the program

365
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,839
what kind of mandate did they have did

366
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,160
they have training how formalized was it

367
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,079
do they have incentives how did they

368
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,959
recruit uh champions all that stuff was

369
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,560
part of the questions that came out in

370
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,720
the survey and then two key questions in

371
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,399
the end is you know did they you know

372
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,079
kind of a yes no did they

373
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,240
feel that they were achieving results

374
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,639
and if so how did they measure roi just

375
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,560
two questions again we had a bunch of

376
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,240
other draft questions we threw out some

377
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,839
and as a matter of fact there are some

378
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,839
other ones that we just flat out didn't

379
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,200
use for

380
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,760
feedback so right off the bat i asked

381
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,880
you know how would you care

382
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,480
self-identify how would you characterize

383
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,959
your abstract uh champion program

384
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,519
uh based on a broad scale and i put some

385
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,200
attributes around this that i enumerate

386
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,720
in the report but

387
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,800
the vast majority were maturing between

388
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,040
maturing and mature

389
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,399
there were a few that were just getting

390
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,320
started they said they were emerging

391
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
um there are a couple that were up at

392
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,200
the improving area no no optimizing

393
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
uh so that was an interesting starting

394
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,199
point is uh

395
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,279
you know there in in the numbers reflect

396
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,720
that that they said

397
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,560
hey you know we recognize we're we're

398
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,959
moving along uh and there's a lot of

399
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,880
back and forth dialogue about

400
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,839
mature

401
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,839
versus maturing and the attributes of

402
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,839
that so there's some discretion here but

403
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,240
majority of them felt that they had

404
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,800
some level of program in place and we're

405
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,079
moving uh and improving uh the program

406
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,839
itself so that's the starting point for

407
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,959
analysis

408
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,959
uh and in the report itself i kind of

409
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,880
break out a little bit of the different

410
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,120
attributes of that so here's one of the

411
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,600
things that came out that is initially

412
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,199
uninteresting but then the the

413
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,600
derivation uh secondary analysis was

414
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,680
interesting first of all you know how

415
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
many developers do you have like on

416
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,000
average 1600 a number that

417
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,399
doesn't mean a whole lot because samples

418
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,680
all over the place

419
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,240
how many apps six step per uh you know

420
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,160
uh that were focused

421
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,720
averages 13 and then how many champions

422
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,320
you know they're all over the place uh

423
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,760
the more mature ones had more as you

424
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,320
might imagine and and i didn't ask one

425
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,240
question i wish i had at the time which

426
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,279
was the coverage between ap champions

427
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,279
and teams like what percentage of teams

428
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,600
he had a champion i was like halfway

429
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,519
into it and then i wish i'd asked that

430
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,680
but the key finding was

431
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,399
the ratio between access staff and

432
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,720
development staff was one to fifty to

433
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,560
one to one hundred for the mature

434
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,839
programs uh they all along that uh

435
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,839
spectrum where the mature to maturing

436
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,519
programs were somewhere between one to

437
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,240
fifty ratio of absent people

438
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,519
not the champions but the actual

439
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,959
abstract staff

440
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,399
to developers

441
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,399
and particularly as it relates to the

442
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,560
financial and fintech companies right

443
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,480
down the middle uh one to fifty to one

444
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,720
one hundred i come came to find out

445
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
after the fact uh that some of these

446
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,720
that reflects numbers that also are

447
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,600
parallel to what uh the folks do in bsim

448
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,360
have come up with too at least in a

449
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,800
couple of instances which i think is

450
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,880
cool so that that is a

451
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,519
um a key finding that kind of jumped out

452
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,480
the average numbers don't mean as much

453
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,639
i looked at other things to infer and

454
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,160
sophistication

455
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,920
around tool and pipeline usage

456
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,759
all this stuff is is enumerated in the

457
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,399
report but in a long story made short is

458
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,839
the vast major you know the majority of

459
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,920
them were using pipelines or trending to

460
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,800
use pipelines uh almost all of us that

461
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
were going down that path you know very

462
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,240
few were doing old school dev as as you

463
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,560
might imagine um and what percent were

464
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
hosted in the cloud

465
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,440
uh 30 percent said over 90 percent were

466
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,600
and the interesting thing on both the

467
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,839
the the lines were a little bit blurred

468
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,839
there distorted by the fact that

469
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,440
uh i had two or three of the very

470
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,639
largest

471
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,519
uh

472
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,480
uh financial services and banks reported

473
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,959
they're all on-prem uh which is uh for

474
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,360
the big banks a thing absent of at least

475
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
one big bank who is uh you know

476
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,920
primarily in aws a lot of them still are

477
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,839
on-prem so that's interesting

478
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,079
um so here's one that jumped out as a

479
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,680
big one um

480
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,440
so i asked a question about how many

481
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,279
people you know what how many of y'all

482
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,160
had sas or death or sca or what you know

483
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,320
and what i found out is

484
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,040
almost all of the mature and virtually

485
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,839
all the maturing ones had all three

486
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,000
sas das and software composition

487
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,800
analysis in place which there's you know

488
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,639
i heard chris weiss opal speech you know

489
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,639
talk about at least two i also heard

490
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,920
edton's

491
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,600
presentation from

492
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,760
hcl so there's a common theme here you

493
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,039
know multiple tools uh correlation

494
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,039
and i think garner also says at least

495
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,520
use two tools well guess what the most

496
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,400
mature ones use all three of those

497
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,480
as part of their testing program

498
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,400
and i thought that was a a cool thing

499
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,240
that i didn't anticipate

500
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,559
uh how long did it take to build program

501
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,240
the program itself

502
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,760
about uh

503
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,160
about 20 of the year um and so so a year

504
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,320
to a little bit over a year some of them

505
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,400
were in progress at the point now the

506
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,640
one interesting thing that uh

507
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,160
came out from this that i didn't

508
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,400
anticipate is a multiple resets we had

509
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,520
uh

510
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,919
clients that had come back and said hey

511
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,120
uh you know we lost the key personnel or

512
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,280
leadership change and as a result we

513
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,080
have a complete uh you know like we're

514
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,000
starting over so these numbers are kind

515
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
of muddled but think at least a year to

516
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,240
your plus to get these up and running

517
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,760
now the other interesting thing is i

518
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,080
asked how long they have been in place

519
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
and you know a lot there some of the big

520
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,520
financial ones have been in place for

521
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,200
over four years that 27 percent not not

522
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,360
didn't know what had happened is there's

523
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,919
so much turnover in apsec that i had

524
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,360
about a third of the respondents say

525
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
that they didn't know they had no idea

526
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,760
or wait they had to find out so they had

527
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,080
started before they had arrived and were

528
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,120
in place already so one of the secondary

529
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,720
findings from this is that like these

530
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,799
things need leadership

531
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,720
you know focus and care and feeding or

532
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,520
else you know key person leaves or

533
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,240
direction changes and they um

534
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,080
and they can go away

535
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,039
here is another thing about

536
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,480
organizational background that i found

537
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
out is the most absent programs did not

538
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
have a strong mandate from you know the

539
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,320
opposite of the trusted computing

540
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,679
initiative from

541
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,000
bill gates in 2002 as a matter of fact

542
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,600
two-thirds either had no mandate or

543
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,080
sizzle only and i and for the purposes

544
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,080
of this presentation

545
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,280
of this report is like if you have a

546
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,360
sizzle only that of course you do you

547
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,200
know i didn't have a single respondent

548
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,840
that said they had the cfo ceo or ceo

549
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,480
the best i had was like cto where dev

550
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,240
lived so that's an important thing it's

551
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,520
like these these things are happening

552
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,320
organically as we suspected

553
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,720
um lacking the trusted computing

554
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
initiative leadership the the top-down

555
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,480
bill gates approach

556
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,640
uh so here's some interesting ones and

557
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,080
it's just the time i'm going to blast

558
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,000
through them did you have defined roles

559
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,280
and standards

560
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,480
62 said yes that's a it's a relatively

561
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,600
low number

562
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,559
um that a lot of the programs use

563
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,240
volunteered but not as many as i thought

564
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,919
there's a healthy combination of

565
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,919
volunteered and voluntold

566
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,919
which the assumption here is you're

567
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,960
trying to get people that are

568
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,880
evangelical you know on the dev teams

569
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,320
you may want to have people that are

570
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,039
really already bought in so i do think i

571
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,799
didn't enumerate this in the report but

572
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,799
the the real ones that were successful

573
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,400
anecdotally were ones that had

574
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,000
volunteered you know and how do you

575
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,760
recruit volunteers there's a whole

576
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,840
discussion track there

577
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,320
the last two results surprised me it did

578
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,880
not have formal training programs the

579
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,559
majority didn't and they didn't have

580
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,720
rewards so one of the secondary

581
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,480
recommendations from this is that you

582
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,840
should when you're starting these

583
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,039
programs

584
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,080
have a a formalized training and

585
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,799
formalized reward program to scale

586
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,520
uh that and rewards don't have to be

587
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,280
spending a lot of money it could be

588
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,520
you know the rewards like recognition

589
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
amongst one's peers that's that's

590
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,640
important too

591
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,960
so the last a couple things two or three

592
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
things that we came up with is you know

593
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,840
the back and forth how do you how

594
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,760
frequently do you communicate

595
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,080
and um you know it said constantly well

596
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,600
that that what happened is we found out

597
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,240
of course slack teams like constantly

598
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,720
monthly but what this that what we also

599
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,200
found out that was less obvious is

600
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,080
uh

601
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,000
folks identify this this first came out

602
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,080
in the secondary questions was like yeah

603
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,799
we communicate for all the time on slack

604
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,799
but there's still a role for formalized

605
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,799
like a communications either once a

606
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,799
month town hall or a once a month

607
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,039
newsletter will recognize people so that

608
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,559
that's back and forth that's great that

609
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,320
we have slack out there but that doesn't

610
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,240
constitute the only communication

611
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,440
mechanism

612
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,679
and a formalized mechanism augmenting

613
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,760
that is is probably pretty good and of

614
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
course everybody you know 64 percent use

615
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
slack in teams there's probably two or

616
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,919
three that number that probably is

617
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,080
underrepresented there uh there's

618
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,159
probably two or three that said they

619
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,760
were doing the starting point of

620
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,039
gamification comparison amongst teams

621
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,360
um you know looking at some of the

622
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,960
training platforms like secure code

623
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,880
warrior they do more of the gamification

624
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,240
that really didn't come up this much i

625
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,320
was surprised it didn't come up more in

626
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,440
in the survey itself so um

627
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,600
okay so i'm gonna uh two things um you

628
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,840
know two roa questions i asked are you

629
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,000
achieving your desired outcome you know

630
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,559
like broadly yes or no

631
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,840
so

632
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,679
you know not not all of them did you

633
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,480
know and and i think there was this bore

634
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,320
a lot of follow-up conversations a lot

635
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,159
of head scratching

636
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,159
but i mean these things just started

637
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,760
organically in certain instances and

638
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,919
they started doing it and there wasn't a

639
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,919
whole lot of forethought in in many

640
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,520
instances of what the outcome looked

641
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,760
like and the same thing is two on the

642
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
numbers side we've been able to quantify

643
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,880
success the majority said no or partly

644
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,720
in the case of certain service providers

645
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,480
they said well we kind of have in the

646
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,039
form of like you know bug

647
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,120
you know uh bug bug

648
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,919
bug reports or mean time to fix numbers

649
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,760
but really we have never asked our

650
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,840
clients you know or we haven't asked the

651
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,679
business units themselves

652
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,440
so that's that is an interesting

653
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,120
observation i assumed that there would

654
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
be more of that and there wasn't

655
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,880
so again i've got like five minutes i

656
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,400
want to i don't want to blow through the

657
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,520
the key findings and some

658
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,919
recommendations first of all there was a

659
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,200
strong belief in these programs

660
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,360
regardless of the numbers i mean period

661
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,120
there's an evangelical

662
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,760
component to this is you know as apsec

663
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,320
is i mean we are we we are still

664
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,400
preaching to the the vast unwashed

665
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,919
masses in certain instances so we're

666
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,200
trying to you know convince the

667
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
developers to do something so that's

668
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,080
true the roi that we got was was you

669
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,400
know the roi reports were

670
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,559
were great but not as much as with the

671
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,720
anecdotes though were fantastic as a

672
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,080
matter of fact we got many of them that

673
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,159
will be or in the report where you know

674
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,440
they said no we didn't capture those

675
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,240
numbers we don't have anything

676
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,440
formalized but wow when you know the the

677
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,280
this guy said this in front of the

678
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,000
business unit uh you know that that just

679
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,679
took off so there's a there was a lot of

680
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,840
anecdote that came out and that's why

681
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,720
the report and the uh survey was was

682
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,280
ended up being you know very valuable is

683
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
that the numbers themselves were

684
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,799
interesting but some of the anecdotes

685
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,159
and some of the war stories were great

686
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,559
too uh the majority programs had a weak

687
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,600
managerial a mandate as we anticipated

688
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,200
and that there were certain correlations

689
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,520
that do exist between you know those

690
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,039
those numbers between dev and absent

691
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,679
staff and the the sas das and sca and

692
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,520
maturity i thought those were things

693
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,480
that jumped out that were pretty

694
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,880
interesting um again the the the

695
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,679
in-depth rec uh surveys and going to be

696
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,880
in the report

697
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,200
but here's the relevance to you and this

698
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,360
is

699
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,080
for

700
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,559
growth from intel push is like like as a

701
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,799
manager you have to

702
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,440
not do one for one work uh

703
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,000
you have to do all these other things uh

704
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,480
and make oh let me go back

705
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,840
um and and make and and influence others

706
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,360
and influence group this is absolutely

707
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,200
the case with absolute champions again a

708
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
handful of uh absolute people trying to

709
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,760
influence thousands of developers

710
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,080
um comparative data around surveys is

711
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,400
important in general comparing from your

712
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,600
peers using

713
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,000
like fsi sac or sam or vsan or whatever

714
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,279
anything you can do to compare is

715
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,559
important

716
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,080
but in order to gain that managerial

717
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,919
leverage you do need to capture and

718
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,200
formalize some of these the things

719
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,000
around training and around roi numbers

720
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,720
you can't do word of mouth or

721
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,120
uh you know you just can't do

722
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,000
the standard way that you know uh tribal

723
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,360
knowledge you actually have to have

724
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,080
things laid out uh training materials in

725
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,919
order to scale so in order to get scale

726
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,320
leverage you have to do that and finally

727
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,840
um you know we'll know when we're

728
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,240
successful when when

729
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,720
the developers themselves start to view

730
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,480
uh security or or whatever you would

731
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,880
call resiliency as a as a component of

732
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,279
code quality where there's no longer

733
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,240
this this confrontational deal they just

734
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,559
essentially like ui ux or other aspects

735
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,320
and facets of development it's just a

736
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,640
concept of quality that they pull in and

737
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,240
we're coaching and validating doing

738
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,720
whatever we're not essential to that so

739
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
uh that is the end of the prezzo i think

740
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,400
i hit it right close to the end of the

741
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,279
hour

742
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,960
um that's my twitter handle uh and if

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,039
this and about people that are fired up

754
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,960
