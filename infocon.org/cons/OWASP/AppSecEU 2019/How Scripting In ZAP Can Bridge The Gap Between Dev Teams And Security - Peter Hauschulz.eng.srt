1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,729
stray ssin so my name is Peter house

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:10,820
Schulz you hear in the zest of SAP

3
00:00:07,729 --> 00:00:12,440
presentation thanks everyone for being

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,030
here and that's really excited to be

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,880
here thanks for a wasp knapsack for

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:20,530
having me I'm working currently at human

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,509
eye T in Sweden as a tester

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,730
okay so we'll try and zip through the

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,080
who am i part and the reason I like to

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,760
go over this is to kind of illustrate

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,470
the background not just for everyone

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,589
here but for the people you may be

13
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,149
teaching and people who may have

14
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:37,160
obstacles to learning security and using

15
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:40,010
zap or whatever tools they need to learn

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,230
so my background is not IT I spent five

17
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,800
years as a sandwich I mean making

18
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,239
sandwiches I did two years doing does

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,099
anyone know what the top middle part is

20
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:51,709
it's really weird that it's this much

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,690
higher I actually can't point to it

22
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,940
the top middle one is an autopsy table I

23
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,818
spent two years doing doing autopsies as

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,699
an autopsy technician it's kind of

25
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:05,269
forensic analysis but on the body not

26
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:07,250
not digital stuff librarian I've got

27
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,740
certain more certificates with breaks

28
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,020
and rebuilds and engine rebuilds within

29
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,949
I do technical computer certificates

30
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,990
I had a Nokia brick phone until the

31
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,119
provider in the US AT&T sent me a text

32
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,770
message saying they're discontinuing to

33
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,530
use their antennas and that I needed to

34
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,729
switch phones so I don't always have I

35
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,590
haven't always been on the cutting edge

36
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:32,420
it's all we say and I also used to

37
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:36,950
install windows actual windows in the

38
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,539
houses so I want to get a sense of who

39
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,030
everyone is in the room how many people

40
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:46,880
here are like full-time security

41
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:48,829
professionals developers testers so as a

42
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,890
few yeah that's my crew right there okay

43
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:55,038
a project managers scrum agile product

44
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:58,460
owners a a little bit okay great so a

45
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:59,659
good good good cross-section it's good

46
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,949
to know where people are coming from I

47
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:02,329
did this same talk at a testing

48
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,009
conference and a developing conference

49
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:05,240
earlier this year and kind of what

50
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:07,850
people bring to the table is always a

51
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,060
little bit different so today what I

52
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:13,010
want to talk about is kind of 1 & 2 we

53
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,180
have opportunities always to elevate

54
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,099
ourselves and the quality of

55
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,939
our work and our output in the world and

56
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,828
that's why we're here at a conference

57
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:21,019
try and be inspired to learn new things

58
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:23,450
that are practical or that maybe we

59
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:25,519
could use and to teach and improve

60
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:29,060
others as well which elevates the entire

61
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,069
community and kind of the software and

62
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,590
technical world that we all interact

63
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:36,048
with the whole ecosystem so we're gonna

64
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,859
focus on the second one so the main

65
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:42,230
dilemma to solve is as we are all here

66
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:45,200
for our security posture is a bit of an

67
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,909
issue it's really easy to talk to

68
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,108
companies or people in companies and

69
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:50,780
people will be like yeah security is

70
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:53,239
important but then when it comes to what

71
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,970
are they doing practically as far as the

72
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,769
teams or the development cycles or the

73
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,450
planning you know what are they actually

74
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,129
doing they like to talk about all we do

75
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,260
security of course we do security we

76
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:04,819
love security but then you know when

77
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,379
they actually have to when push comes to

78
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:08,929
shove and they have to decide between

79
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:10,939
putting out a product on release

80
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,769
schedule or putting in security and have

81
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:16,010
to decide between the two which one are

82
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:17,629
they gonna pick so security could be

83
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,429
said to be a kind of elephant in the

84
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:27,078
room sneaking up behind us ok so what

85
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,669
are the main obstacles to are things

86
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:30,889
that we are struggling with that make

87
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:33,040
this an issue and I think there's kind

88
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:36,199
of four big categories and that's people

89
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,189
there's the knowledge there's resources

90
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:43,250
and then time time is a huge one for for

91
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:45,620
everyone and so today we're gonna be

92
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,540
focusing on the knowledge and kind of

93
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,310
the resources the middle one and the

94
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,858
left one so unfortunately when you walk

95
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,530
out of this class or this talk you won't

96
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:57,500
have more time you won't have 60 hours

97
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,319
in your work week well hopefully not and

98
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,669
you won't have more people in your team

99
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,228
but maybe with enough knowledge you can

100
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,209
kind of convert people and other teams

101
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:06,799
and then maybe they will become part of

102
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:09,470
your team so how are we going to do that

103
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,780
well by learning and learning is kind of

104
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,540
the mental equivalent of lifting a keg

105
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,650
full of concrete over your head and this

106
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,599
is something I think it's important for

107
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,430
us to remember that learning is work and

108
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:20,899
we have to treat it kind of with that

109
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,669
level of respect but also in our

110
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,789
students as well there they are working

111
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:28,549
hard

112
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,160
okay so how do we get security into the

113
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:34,100
dev type line cuz that's that's really

114
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,630
what we're trying to do and yeah we've

115
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,550
got our ninja there we've got our cool

116
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,520
agile loop and we've got our infinity

117
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,890
DevOps thing and we've got our little

118
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,840
crusty old waterfall you know where

119
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,490
where does where does security fit in

120
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,380
there like we were talking about

121
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,020
companies love talking about doing

122
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,159
security but when it comes to actually

123
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,900
putting it somewhere you know where do

124
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,550
they put it and usually it's tacked on

125
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,440
at the end and unfortunately with

126
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:03,650
testing that's usually the cases as well

127
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:07,100
so hopefully we can solve that so why is

128
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:10,310
that like I mentioned I gave this talk

129
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,870
to two weeks ago at a testing conference

130
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,780
in Malmo so there's only testers there

131
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,540
or those testing themed and I had some

132
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,890
kind of interactive questions online

133
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,780
when they're doing a survey real time

134
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,070
while we're doing the presentation and I

135
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,479
asked them seven different questions we

136
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,520
won't go into all those but these were -

137
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,770
I asked them that's how close are you to

138
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,090
your security team and what's your

139
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,099
biggest obstacle and learning about

140
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,570
security does anyone have any guesses

141
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,360
what they think the answers were to

142
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,540
these that's too early to blurt out

143
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,010
stuff that's fine hey so here's the

144
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:44,200
first one here's the answers to the

145
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:46,190
first one it's multiple choice so

146
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,640
obviously the thing we really need to

147
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:54,590
work on is taking people out to fancy

148
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:56,659
dinners more often but no it's it's a

149
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,280
visibility issue and it's not only a

150
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,720
visibility but it's an approach ability

151
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,119
issue which I'll get into a little bit

152
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,980
later but security teams are often

153
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,700
understaffed especially for larger

154
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,780
companies or smaller ones really and so

155
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,670
they're not visible they're not

156
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,400
approachable when people think they

157
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,990
might need information from them they're

158
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,270
not sure if there is one how to get a

159
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,410
hold of them what they can ask them and

160
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:25,280
that kind of that kind of thing so

161
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:30,250
what's oh yes biggest obstacle to

162
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:34,159
learning security seems hard or scary

163
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,330
and I was - I originally asked how they

164
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,070
don't know what a skateboard but I was

165
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,650
told at the last snap SEC in

166
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,390
see that security people rollerblade

167
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:45,650
they don't skateboard so I had to I had

168
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:47,270
to fix that for you guys so so it's hard

169
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,979
it's it's something that's not easy and

170
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,599
there's a it's not

171
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,130
I mean codings hard testings hard

172
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,690
anything with technical stuff is hard

173
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,370
project management is hard managing

174
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,290
people is really hard because there's a

175
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,050
lot a lot of chaos or unpredictable

176
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,120
elements there but somehow something is

177
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,970
special about security hardness that

178
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,440
prevents people from overcoming these

179
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,450
obstacles and that's why I think we want

180
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,150
to acknowledge that these are here so we

181
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,190
can try and overcome them because to

182
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,700
develop the average development team the

183
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,100
average testing team security has a

184
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:22,580
reputation of being this it has the

185
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:25,130
reputation of being you know ninjas in

186
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,620
basements rollerblading around who can

187
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,090
walk up to an ATM kind of like whisper

188
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,740
in to its ear and then a bunch of money

189
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:35,960
comes out and well Hollywood doesn't

190
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,280
help this Hollywood and movies and TV

191
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,960
shows it doesn't help this either where

192
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,659
people are driving next to an airplane

193
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,190
with like a USB connected to it that's

194
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:49,310
not actual hacking once anyone do that

195
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:51,200
in the day job nice okay so so it's it's

196
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,030
it's unapproachable from people are

197
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,260
afraid of it from a technical angle and

198
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,109
they're they're afraid of it on a

199
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,960
personal angle as well because when

200
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,120
people tend to get really good at things

201
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,099
it becomes a part of like our identity

202
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,870
whether you identify with your job or

203
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,010
your hobbies and then you're like oh

204
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,180
this is something I'm really good at I'm

205
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,950
really proud of that but it's really

206
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,430
easy to go a little bit too far

207
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:15,440
and make that something where you you're

208
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,750
worried that if other people are good at

209
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,460
what you're good at

210
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:24,650
then you're not as valuable anymore and

211
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,320
the this community and basically every

212
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,760
community sports music everything has

213
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,200
issues with that we're people who are

214
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,120
really good at things aren't always good

215
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,549
at including people who aren't good at

216
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,080
it they're not good at teaching or

217
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,280
bringing people into the fold they're

218
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,039
like oh you're not good at that you know

219
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,569
let me handle the security stuff that's

220
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,250
called gatekeeping and it's big in the

221
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,750
extreme metal community as well where

222
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,000
like certain levels of bands are

223
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,470
considered better than others and then

224
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,420
if you're if you don't like those bands

225
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,950
you like oh you asked them to

226
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,139
we need stuff you know iOS into good

227
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,700
stuff the security has an issue with

228
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:58,670
that as well and so there's it's good to

229
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,459
know or acknowledge that that is that is

230
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,660
an obstacle that people are running into

231
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,040
that's preventing them from learning

232
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:09,680
that's preventing them from contributing

233
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:11,449
to a better safer ecosystem or security

234
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,979
looks like this where you have some

235
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:15,380
people showing up with some clipboards

236
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,420
and ruin your weekend with a bunch of

237
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,699
paperwork so it can be ISO compliant you

238
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,079
don't know what it is do you just know

239
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:22,310
you have to document a bunch of crap

240
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:23,870
that you don't want to do and that takes

241
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,420
away time from the cool coding you want

242
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,829
to do so security has to kind of fight

243
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,540
against these reputations you know

244
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:30,410
whether these are deserved or not it

245
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,870
doesn't matter we have to acknowledge

246
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:36,139
they're there and help overcome those or

247
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:39,260
help other people bridge the gap to

248
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:41,690
taking part in quality output so the

249
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,800
solution event comes right out of the

250
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:47,930
certified ethical hackers handbook

251
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,790
piggybacking so what I mean by that is

252
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,589
we already have someone in dev teams

253
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:55,760
whose whole job

254
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:59,079
I hope not always but whose whole job is

255
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,250
to acknowledge standards acknowledge

256
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:04,969
requirements and recommendations and

257
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:07,610
verify that those are met whose whole

258
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,170
job is is evaluating that software is

259
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,199
doing what it's supposed to do and not

260
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:15,189
doing what it's not supposed to do and

261
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:18,079
of course I'm referring to testers

262
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,850
they already have the mindset of

263
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,370
evaluating software and evaluating

264
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,350
functions and applications for what it

265
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,670
should do and what it should not do so

266
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,930
that's how they're already approaching

267
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,519
it and that's the reason they're there

268
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,989
as developers there to build and you

269
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,579
need a new perspective to come in and

270
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,740
say you know how can it break what

271
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:38,180
happens when it does break how can I

272
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,949
break it how can other users break it so

273
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:45,410
here's my one slide summary of like test

274
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:46,519
theory there's two basic categories of

275
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,110
testing you know if something does

276
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,790
whatever you want it to do and if it

277
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,290
doesn't do what you don't want it to do

278
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,699
and that's the one that includes an

279
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,769
infinite infinite number of

280
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:57,620
possibilities but you want to you know

281
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:59,149
test the major cases so if a tester is

282
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,149
you know doing like a simple function

283
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:04,280
you want to test the happy flow the

284
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:06,080
expected input like you

285
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,900
integer between 1 and 50s you want to

286
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,830
test an input of 25 1 and 50 then you

287
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,480
want to test some other ones that you

288
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,970
know won't work or shouldn't work

289
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,230
you got your 0 51 negative 1 you know

290
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,360
whatever does everyone everyone kind of

291
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:23,750
get the idea what lot of testers doing

292
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,860
here anyone confused or just and that's

293
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,990
totally fine if you are is probably my

294
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,300
fault I just want to make sure we're all

295
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,800
on board this is a new slide for my last

296
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,020
presentation that I wanted to expand on

297
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,490
so that's what testers are doing they

298
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,350
already have that vocabulary they're

299
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:40,600
already approaching these problems with

300
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:43,580
that way and so what we want to do is

301
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,320
help them learn basically the same way

302
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,750
we all learned at some point we're all

303
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,270
learning now something you know we're

304
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,920
all not just something we're expert at

305
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,480
we're expert in one area and we're all

306
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,920
learning other things constantly in

307
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,320
other areas at least I hope so and

308
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,209
that's kind of through you've got a

309
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,240
practice if you've got to start small

310
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,490
with your crawl walk run method and you

311
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,050
can't be mad at yourself that you're not

312
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,360
sprinting right away you can't be mad at

313
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:11,420
yourself that I can't hack into an

314
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,370
iPhone 10 you know the first day I try

315
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,680
and pull up some hacking tools on my

316
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,610
computer and it's the same when you're

317
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,920
teaching it or you're trying to

318
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,820
encourage other people to learn and so

319
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,439
that's that's part of the learning

320
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,480
process and an another learning thing I

321
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,310
want to mention is analogy I do a lot of

322
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,660
teaching to some immigrant communities

323
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,739
in Sweden for people who have moved

324
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,329
there and are learning to become

325
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,910
developers trying to change jobs and

326
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:40,010
usually what I use in kind of learning

327
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:43,100
or teaching technology stuff is heavy on

328
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,960
metaphors and analogies where you have

329
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,610
people coming from restaurant

330
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,800
backgrounds or engineering or you know

331
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:52,040
any number of astrophysics I think we

332
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,319
did set lady master physics use use

333
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,910
something people understand already and

334
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,339
then compare it to something they don't

335
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:01,250
and that creates those bridges so

336
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:02,150
usually I describe like HTTP requests

337
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,970
when I'm trying to get people to

338
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:08,180
understand front-end back-end and api's

339
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:10,070
and requests network traffic I'll use a

340
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,319
restaurant metaphor because people know

341
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,150
how restaurants were people knows what a

342
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,040
waiter is running back and forth with an

343
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,439
order they know in a kitchen is they

344
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,000
know how

345
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,760
it's different from like the seating

346
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,970
area so usually you can relate you know

347
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,500
your your order to that HTTP request you

348
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,860
can relate the kitchen to the back end

349
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:32,430
to the to the back stock of ingredients

350
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,350
in the refrigerator to a database and by

351
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,359
bridging those gaps you can create

352
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,520
awareness and knowledge where it didn't

353
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,630
exist before with analogy so I would

354
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,340
encourage you know if you're out there

355
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,050
teaching security to people who don't

356
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,610
know it yet find something they're

357
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,890
passionate about whether it's sports or

358
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:49,290
cooking or anything and make those

359
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,370
analogies and it's a lot easier than

360
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,689
just saying well look at the sequel

361
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,240
injection aren't you worried about this

362
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,430
and then just you know explain it over

363
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,500
and over again but it might not you

364
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:02,250
might not click and maybe analogies with

365
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,620
it will so the solution to the learning

366
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,820
problem or the teaching problem a wasp's

367
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,880
app that's why we're all here how many

368
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,730
people use that on a regular basis how

369
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,490
many people have used it or know what it

370
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:17,400
is okay so okay how many people have

371
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:21,780
never used it whew okay awesome that's

372
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:24,060
great too okay so how does that help and

373
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:26,069
kind of with the second column we were

374
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,660
talking about with testers that tries to

375
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,620
force web apps to do things they

376
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,230
shouldn't do or shouldn't be able to do

377
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,790
this actually works in some older cars

378
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:39,000
because the authentication is the key

379
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,349
but behind the key cylinder it's just a

380
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,970
thing that turns so if you can pop the

381
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:45,270
whole key cylinder out you can just turn

382
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:47,250
it with the key a screwdriver so here's

383
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,380
what Zapp does here's what security

384
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,790
testing is back into that tester mindset

385
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,280
which is why I think testers are a great

386
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,810
place to start with this if the tester

387
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,390
is doing the the positive test cases

388
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,609
some basic functional or you know

389
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,980
negative test cases and you know why not

390
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,650
expand their vocabulary into the

391
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,480
security room where now you've got some

392
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,579
attempts at buffer overflow the

393
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,410
formatting is terrible but that one's

394
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:15,600
like some XSS locators it doesn't take a

395
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,490
big conceptual leap because the testers

396
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,110
are already thinking like this this is

397
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,570
just new input that they get to play

398
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:25,140
with that have different expectations

399
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,640
other than just numeric verification and

400
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,650
that's where zaps great because it's got

401
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,670
all these stored already so as testers I

402
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,300
don't even have to like write all those

403
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,880
down

404
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,479
I can just find the library and let it

405
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,480
do its business

406
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:44,340
okay so doing the crawl walk run method

407
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:46,290
so step learning step one what what I

408
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,960
recommend and kind of what I did in my

409
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,839
transition from installing Windows to

410
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,060
more security based software IT type

411
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,430
stuff is just running running zapped

412
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,810
with your favorite browser like don't

413
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,510
even do anything with it just let it

414
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:04,709
proxy the traffic and because the real

415
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:06,030
key there is for those who don't use it

416
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,410
you know kind of in the bottom left and

417
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,650
there'll be a small demo or I can show

418
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,600
it to you as well the there's an alerts

419
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,069
tab where it's flagging things that it's

420
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,230
concerned about or that it wants you to

421
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,030
look at that there are potential

422
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,450
vulnerabilities are things that could be

423
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:23,910
vulnerabilities or issues and what that

424
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,220
alerts tab really is is that's to me

425
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,140
that's a teacher that's a mentor zap

426
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,760
knows things about the security world

427
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,230
it's a collection of a bunch of

428
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,660
different people's knowledge and best

429
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,440
practice and as a new person I don't

430
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,400
know these things

431
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,870
I don't know how to ask these questions

432
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,459
I don't know who to ask but here it's

433
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,440
saying you know hey here's a here's a

434
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,480
cookie poisoning I'm like well what's

435
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,220
cookie poisoning then you look at it you

436
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,110
start your googling and you kind of

437
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,970
start learning like one day at a time a

438
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,590
few more concepts start becoming a

439
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,790
little more clear oh this is what well

440
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,490
this is what it's talking about this is

441
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,020
why that's good this is why it's bad so

442
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,440
this is learning step one I think if you

443
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,699
can just get dev teams just using this

444
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,930
not even using it using it passively

445
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,839
that alerts tab can be our teacher now

446
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,950
step two especially for testers you

447
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,300
don't you can do more than just put a

448
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,790
browser through it you can run your

449
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,430
regular test Suites through it you got

450
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:21,420
your soap UI you got selenium automation

451
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:23,820
postman rest-assured jmeter any number

452
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,310
of existing regression tests or data

453
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,860
driven tests or automated stuff API is

454
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:32,370
whatever you can point it through zapped

455
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:35,550
and basically what that will do is it

456
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:38,399
again populates that alerts fields but

457
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:40,649
it gives me the extra benefit of those

458
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,570
those alerts and those assertions those

459
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,540
security assertions and I don't have to

460
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,460
code those

461
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,460
you know when I write a test in and

462
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,290
jmeter or anything like that I've got a

463
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,700
hard code every single assertion I

464
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,830
wanted to make about the status code

465
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,010
about the response time about certain

466
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:58,720
Rexes and that takes time whereas zap is

467
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,310
already going to leverage you know a few

468
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,710
thousand assertions across all of its

469
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:04,540
passive scanners so you can add it in

470
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,500
your test pipeline just by pointing

471
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:10,060
pointing your tools to the proxy a

472
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,650
little bit more on that since it's all

473
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,940
open source you can even look at all the

474
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:17,260
stuff that's doing I think here I've

475
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:19,210
expanded the pii scanner that zap has in

476
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,129
it and so here it's flat it's looking

477
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:25,840
for credit card numbers in response

478
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:28,090
bodies and so how many people have had

479
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,340
projects or regularly have projects

480
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:34,770
where the requirements are clearly

481
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:42,970
defined and the standards are

482
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:44,110
objectively complete okay what yeah kind

483
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:46,660
of but I mean just yeah even in your

484
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:49,030
daily work and stuff like that okay oh

485
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,160
good but not not many usually a lot of a

486
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,290
lot of projects are really fast or

487
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,910
issues that we see are you know oh we

488
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,800
want to push this out in a few days you

489
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,540
know this should work like the old one

490
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,750
did and that's like the only requirement

491
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,639
we get and so the reason I want to

492
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,140
highlight that is product owners product

493
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,920
managers stakeholders usually they

494
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,750
create an issue or they want a project

495
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,600
they won't have the security knowledge

496
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,550
or background to explicitly list

497
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,899
security requirements for that issue

498
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,870
they just won't know that they won't

499
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:22,840
request for you know HTTPS only or

500
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:25,689
certain cookie handling or you know that

501
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,939
the database should have hashed all the

502
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,820
PII or that it should not be leaking you

503
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,710
know security or credit card numbers and

504
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,350
so here's that is handy because it's

505
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,120
looking for these things and it will

506
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,439
alert you if they're there even if

507
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,179
you're not looking for them even if you

508
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,520
are never told to explicitly look for

509
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:45,940
them so it helps me as testers because I

510
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:49,110
get bigger coverage for not too much

511
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:52,090
extra work and here's the fun part

512
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:56,050
here's here's the whole title of the

513
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,100
talk is zest scripting so step 3 where

514
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:00,570
you can actually script

515
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:03,280
besides app how many people use zest oh

516
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:06,700
nice okay that's why we're here

517
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,580
great okay so it's been there for a few

518
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,230
years developed by Mozilla and basically

519
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,049
kind of as you can see on the Left

520
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:16,059
there's a scripting engine inside zap

521
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:18,309
that's and this is a graphical scripting

522
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:20,139
engine zest so you can drag and drop

523
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:22,090
stuff and right-click and just create

524
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:28,390
things that way kind of kind of like an

525
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:30,459
adult security version of scratch but it

526
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,169
also supports JavaScript Python and

527
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,780
stuff like that but basically you can

528
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:36,940
run scripts inside zap that will either

529
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,480
extend its functionality or create extra

530
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:43,090
rules or it called make extra calls the

531
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,250
API is or to its own API and all kinds

532
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,770
of different things so it gives it a lot

533
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,110
of flexibility a lot of a lot of

534
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:53,530
functionality that don't exist in other

535
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:56,428
tools and that's why we have this here

536
00:20:53,530 --> 00:21:00,039
okay oh cool

537
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:05,710
all right now that's not how we want

538
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:08,370
that okay so how does this look how does

539
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:12,100
that look that looks fantastic

540
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:14,649
okay so if you can see my mouse we're

541
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,020
over by the site's tree and there's a

542
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:20,650
little plus next to it and if you hit

543
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,730
that you get the scripts dialogue and so

544
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,220
there you get a list of all the

545
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:27,070
different kinds of scripts that how they

546
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,799
categorize them ends app whether you can

547
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:34,299
add extra rules that applied only proxy

548
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:37,240
messages authentication ones the HUD

549
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:40,360
ones for front-end stuff passive rules

550
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,250
to create extra alerts but I want to go

551
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,260
I want at least highlight today because

552
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,659
you can as we could do an entire day

553
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:49,299
seminar on this stuff I want to

554
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:50,710
highlight standalone because these are

555
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:54,730
the ones where you click on them and

556
00:21:50,710 --> 00:22:01,539
they will run once so I got a little

557
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:08,200
demo one here oh boy and VGA display is

558
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:09,790
really something okay okay so so here

559
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,840
I've got kind of like the script the

560
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,100
script exposed

561
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,199
in the middle is where you run it

562
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:19,090
there's a script console we can be used

563
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,730
to pointing at the slide script console

564
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:24,820
right there any irregular response stuff

565
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:27,340
over there but I want to highlight this

566
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,019
because inside here as you can see I've

567
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,340
got like a get request a delete head

568
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:34,629
options post you can essentially create

569
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,870
tests that you would normally create in

570
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:41,168
soap UI in jmeter in postman collections

571
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:43,449
you can create them inside zap you don't

572
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:45,429
even need to proxy other tests through

573
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:51,999
it you can create them natively inside

574
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:54,789
zap so here you can assign variables you

575
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:57,039
can make assertions on things which is

576
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:59,710
basically what my job is as a testers

577
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,379
I'm constantly trying to evaluate things

578
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:06,639
and testing assertions you've got access

579
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:08,709
to if-then-else statements which you can

580
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:10,869
do in a nested sort of way you can

581
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:14,740
assign variables and I think down here

582
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:18,309
we've got some loops are we on here some

583
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:20,830
of my later requests there there you can

584
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:22,570
see there's variables in the request so

585
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,879
it'll take variables that you defined

586
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,939
earlier into your request so it can make

587
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:30,009
it dynamic so you can even pull pull

588
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,869
tokens out of responses and then

589
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:34,210
dynamically add them to later later

590
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:39,009
requests so I use this for a lot of

591
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:43,809
regression testing and that's kind of

592
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:47,409
the era nice coups it's messing around

593
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:48,999
there so let's just when you click run

594
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:51,789
then you get your little tab and it

595
00:23:48,999 --> 00:24:02,769
shows up in our little friendly our

596
00:23:51,789 --> 00:24:05,340
friendly area there looks like it that's

597
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:05,340
attritional

598
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:17,550
yeah when we got a little failure for a

599
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:19,650
gateway issue as well well that's the

600
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:23,010
basic the basic aspects of these of

601
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:25,230
these scripts there again there's a lot

602
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,690
more and so start thinking of questions

603
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,340
on like how you'd want to use that or

604
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:35,520
what what else you want to know about it

605
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:38,610
oh my okay here's the part I'm bad at as

606
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,270
tabbing back into my presentation okay

607
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:44,610
so what's the benefit of that the

608
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:46,230
benefit of that is we saw why zap is

609
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,939
useful we saw why I mean we're we know

610
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,250
why it is we know what we can do with

611
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,290
alerts both to find security issues but

612
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,760
also to educate which are two huge

613
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:57,030
things that the community needs as a

614
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,900
whole and it's that traditional tools

615
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:03,120
are separate silos like for load testing

616
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:06,060
I'm using our jmeter you've got API

617
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,129
stuff in maybe jmeter maybe it's in

618
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,139
postman usually a lot of manual testing

619
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,420
developers and testers will do in

620
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,310
postman you've got all these different

621
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,110
tools for different things and then

622
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:17,639
you've got zap doing security testing

623
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,580
but then when it comes time to you know

624
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,690
introduce security into a pipeline

625
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,159
you're adding an extra tool you're

626
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,450
adding more maintenance you're adding

627
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,120
another thing people have to configure

628
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:30,450
with other things and that creates or

629
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:33,209
that runs into that resistance so with

630
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,800
with the zest scripting you can actually

631
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,690
reduce the number of tools you're using

632
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,610
but you can maintain that higher level

633
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,920
of coverage while incorporating security

634
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,780
at the same time and of course a big

635
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,670
issue is you know how far can you take

636
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,550
that what else can you do with it and

637
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:49,050
you know there's I'm not sure how many

638
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,240
people here are using it but there's a

639
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:56,280
bunch of you know docker containers or

640
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:58,650
images that have zap-zap installed on

641
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,930
them to do scans baseline scans and

642
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,580
stuff like that you can run zap in

643
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,170
headless mode and control it with like

644
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,000
Python scripts because it's got a Python

645
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,620
API it's got a regular API where you can

646
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,650
just throw a curl request set it from

647
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,689
like a shell or a batch script I use it

648
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,190
in Jenkins in that in that way you can

649
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,920
do that either way so you can have it

650
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:19,050
fully automated I've got that on my

651
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,640
machine I think when I left work

652
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:24,580
yesterday I think I've run

653
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,860
like 900 instances of zap in the past

654
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,720
six months

655
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:33,490
that word that I hadn't that I had no I

656
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,290
never touched which was you know I guess

657
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:38,650
probably about eighteen hundred tests

658
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:41,470
test Suites I should say each one having

659
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,890
ten to twenty test cases and five I

660
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,500
don't know

661
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:46,210
that's a huge number and I even have it

662
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,460
on my machine in such a way that I'm

663
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,350
actually using the GUI version to do

664
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,660
manual testing and it'll spin up a

665
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:54,280
headless version on another port run

666
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,049
some other tests that I never see and

667
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,809
then it just lets me know when it's done

668
00:26:56,049 --> 00:27:00,220
and I've got a report and a bucket so

669
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:03,129
you can do anything you want with all

670
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:07,929
that and the zest scripts are available

671
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:11,350
for the automated stuff as well okay

672
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:15,730
we're flying that's good right we like

673
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:17,949
that okay so the super the super duper

674
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:21,520
recap kind of what we've gone over so

675
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:23,530
far I haven't gone over the manual

676
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,010
exploratory testing and fuzz testing but

677
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:28,540
zap is excellent at those which you

678
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,400
either know already or hopefully

679
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:33,399
something tell your tests are about as

680
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,809
it's way easier than postman I think but

681
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,490
we've seen with zest scripting that we

682
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:39,820
can handle stuff like regression testing

683
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:41,679
and automated see ICD stuff both from a

684
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,678
security angle and non-security testing

685
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,380
API testing that's what I do almost

686
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,610
exclusively right now with it

687
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:52,030
integration testing as well with your

688
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:56,709
multiple api's other applications and of

689
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:58,030
course security testing and perhaps most

690
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:06,429
importantly that it can be a great

691
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:08,950
learning and teaching tool so before we

692
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:11,049
get towards the Q&A section I want to

693
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,730
kind of summarize that you know that was

694
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:15,879
kind of recapping the technical aspect

695
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:18,490
but the big summary is that you know the

696
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,770
obstacles we are facing kind of as a

697
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:22,570
community and as technical ecosystem

698
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,790
worldwide they aren't just technical

699
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,470
they're not just of ulnar abilities it's

700
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:28,659
people's resistance to being able to

701
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:31,990
understand them people's resistance to

702
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,510
be able to deal with them and some of

703
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,670
that is knowledge and some of

704
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:37,440
you know willingness to to learn and

705
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,600
some of that's willingness to teach as

706
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,610
well and so it's good to find you know

707
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,020
avenues where we can make progress in

708
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:47,459
this way and I think Zapp is an

709
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:49,710
excellent tool for that which is why we

710
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,900
want to bring up the references so I

711
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,660
think these are ones y'all are probably

712
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,520
already familiar with since we're at app

713
00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:00,210
sec so you know what a wasp is I do a

714
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:02,340
lot of like I said teaching with some

715
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:05,550
volunteer groups but also in the company

716
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:07,439
I work at I would usually sit down like

717
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,909
our dev team and do a little

718
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,510
presentation on like basic security

719
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:14,880
stuff and I found when I asked them if

720
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,960
they knew what zap was none of them knew

721
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,180
what that was which is fine you know

722
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,630
their developers beck and mostly Java

723
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:23,160
developers and I asked them what oh if

724
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,980
they knew what Olas was and I think two

725
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,030
out of ten had ever heard of it so I

726
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,680
think it's important to remember that

727
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,879
you know we've got this community here

728
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,590
where everyone knows what zap is

729
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,150
everyone know what gossip is everyone

730
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,760
knows to Google that for important stuff

731
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:38,790
but there's a huge world of software

732
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,370
engineers and related professions out

733
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,600
there who have never heard of wasp so if

734
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,550
they're never if they've ever heard of

735
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,169
it you know they're not gonna Google

736
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,669
that if they see a website that says oh

737
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,890
ah spot or you know I don't know what

738
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:51,930
that means and they're gonna they're

739
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,880
gonna skip on to Stack Overflow probably

740
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:57,120
to find whatever whatever it is they're

741
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,740
looking for so I really recommend yeah

742
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,899
keeping these not on the top of your

743
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,240
mind necessarily because it probably

744
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,440
already is but also on the top of the

745
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,840
information you're trying to project

746
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,450
because there are such great resources

747
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,330
and best practices and test guides and

748
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:13,530
development guides and cheat sheets and

749
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:16,409
especially I want to emphasize the SAP

750
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:18,690
user group the core developers are

751
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:21,830
always on their answering questions and

752
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:24,030
I'm always on there trying to answer the

753
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,460
possessed type questions so the core

754
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:28,020
developers don't have to so they can

755
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,780
develop stuff and I can just answer the

756
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,400
how to set up a proxy how to how to set

757
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,649
up authentication for your Ajax spider

758
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,400
type stuff so get on that to ask any

759
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:38,370
question you want

760
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,900
there is no question that's too hard or

761
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,860
too easy if it's too hard the developer

762
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,130
will do it that's too easy

763
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:45,750
you know I'll take care of it so get on

764
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,080
there and talk to us and of course

765
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,610
playgrounds everyone loves

766
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,379
playgrounds especially if you're out

767
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,939
there teaching people to use that or

768
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,140
encouraging people to use that they're

769
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,549
gonna want to hit that active Scan

770
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,429
button they're gonna want to hit that

771
00:30:54,549 --> 00:31:00,700
attack mode that sounds cool if they

772
00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:02,110
don't know what it means so make sure

773
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,539
you have your mind people that these are

774
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,189
real payloads with possible legal

775
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:08,740
consequences depending how you're using

776
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,630
it I think there was a question on the

777
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,250
forum I asked or answered the other week

778
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:15,010
or someone was like hey I'm new to zap

779
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:17,490
you know I hit active scan on google.com

780
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:22,860
and it says there's a sequel injection

781
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:25,090
like okay cool glad you're into it

782
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,070
probably not a sequel injection they've

783
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,990
probably like not a default scan is

784
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,519
gonna find one that they don't know

785
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,990
about but also that wasn't really legal

786
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,299
I'm sure they didn't notice because

787
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,639
they're huge but you know maybe use

788
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:38,408
these instead so remember these are out

789
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:41,469
there I think we've got some good juice

790
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:44,289
shop stuff from Bjorn today or tomorrow

791
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:48,460
as well from that thing super cool so

792
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:50,049
okay so now let's get into questions and

793
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,720
I still got the demo up if people want

794
00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:56,590
to see more stuff about like variable

795
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:00,429
handling or potential cases you can want

796
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:03,309
to use it even like basic how to set up

797
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:05,350
like browser proxy anything any

798
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:13,330
questions you have anything coming to

799
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:16,209
mind yeah so for one of our projects we

800
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:18,340
added SEP into like greater bigger

801
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,510
pipeline but one thing we immediately

802
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,490
noticed that once you start getting

803
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:23,529
larger applications it takes like a

804
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:25,630
really long time especially when you're

805
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:27,190
doing so development you really want to

806
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:30,220
scan every time somebody pushes new code

807
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:32,529
to some development branch so what's a

808
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,529
good way to to handle this time

809
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:36,850
mitigation because a lot of a lot of

810
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:40,659
parts of the code are already scanned

811
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:42,580
like a thousand times by now when you're

812
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:44,110
still rescanned every time and it takes

813
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,960
like you can take up to half an hour an

814
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:49,479
hour to build codes right so here you're

815
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,309
talking about like continuous yeah see

816
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,110
ICD pipeline where you want to tease it

817
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:54,908
and just to make sure and it's actually

818
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:57,490
you're having it run triggering like an

819
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:59,289
active scan where it's throwing like

820
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,849
payloads and stuff as well

821
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:04,129
actually kind of funny the slide you had

822
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:06,439
with a pot with Python codes we kind of

823
00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:08,718
pulled it in and adapted it use Python

824
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,690
three instead of two and build something

825
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:15,219
nice of it so yeah we do better scan

826
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:18,769
spidering next again all tweet okay yeah

827
00:33:15,219 --> 00:33:21,109
right yeah that's a that's a tough one

828
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:23,239
because that's almost more of a like a

829
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:24,549
strategy a strategy style because yeah

830
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:28,129
especially if you're doing

831
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:33,649
yeah the passive spider and active every

832
00:33:28,129 --> 00:33:35,599
time now right exactly that's the

833
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:37,539
question right yeah it's basically a

834
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:43,339
contest management issue yet to

835
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:45,559
streamline it to I can't I don't know of

836
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:51,289
an easy way off the top of my head to at

837
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:57,830
least use zest kind of to mitigate that

838
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:59,450
but but yeah there might be because

839
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,658
depending how you're developing new

840
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:07,429
stuff if it's only in certain areas if

841
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:10,279
that could be tied to - yeah like a

842
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:11,599
passing like a limited context and that

843
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:13,789
kind of thing and then doing like a big

844
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,260
overall scan at the end I mean it's a

845
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:19,250
great question and that's a very real

846
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:25,520
use case I wish I had the perfect answer

847
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:29,239
for you right away and the integration

848
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,679
testing right yeah yeah because then if

849
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,908
yeah you're developing like a unit and

850
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,980
then you're doing a big test on

851
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:38,629
everything every time it is gonna be

852
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:41,599
heavy and it's like I'd almost say for

853
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:44,149
that it would be like on a daily basis

854
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,379
running through the passive skins or it

855
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,179
you know like proxying traffic or

856
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:48,980
whatever kind of using that as like a

857
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:51,079
benchmark for like those small code

858
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,149
pushes and then maybe a weekly basis

859
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:55,520
doing the bigger spider active scan type

860
00:34:53,149 --> 00:35:04,308
stuff but yeah it is kind of like a

861
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:06,559
pipeline thank you what I the security

862
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:08,000
testing needs a lot of a knowledge and

863
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:11,150
all developers don't don't have this one

864
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,650
even even if I give them ZUP I try to to

865
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,420
to minimize to the monitor

866
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:18,099
that we can spend on building the

867
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:21,619
circuits test testing so for I also add

868
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:25,099
32 hours scan so we reduce the context

869
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:28,069
but then we we set yourself so we've

870
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:30,230
already of some other tools like static

871
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:32,900
application security testing which are

872
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:36,309
which is really reliable on some kind of

873
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:38,569
the OS categories and I was wondering

874
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:40,130
basically comes up what what should i do

875
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:42,020
like pokken access control system

876
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,670
annotation management since that

877
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:46,690
exposure is something that I would like

878
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:49,430
to monitor with up and with zest what is

879
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:52,400
what are the vulnerabilities on which I

880
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:56,180
should spend some effort to script that

881
00:35:52,400 --> 00:36:01,970
that I will only be able to assess using

882
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:07,368
zest in dynamic testing could you repeat

883
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:09,980
that last part yeah if I use some static

884
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:11,630
testing that does a huge work on the

885
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,579
help of the vulnerabilities that I want

886
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:16,309
us as only the 50 others because it will

887
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:19,039
be more time consuming difficult to

888
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:21,500
industrialize in C ICD and tripping over

889
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:25,220
my own application so teachings up

890
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:27,200
scripting contouring the testing is time

891
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,899
consuming so I will try to limit the the

892
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,230
scope of the you are you are so I will

893
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:35,839
analyze and what kind of inner abilities

894
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:37,880
would i look for would i look for AP

895
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:42,020
addresses on pi/4 centrally the data

896
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:44,420
exposure i will not try to do some XSS

897
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:48,680
scanning right because I know SAS T will

898
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:54,010
find them right I'll come with 90% 99%

899
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:58,308
so so what what do you use zest for

900
00:36:54,010 --> 00:37:00,440
right what what are the villain is what

901
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:04,039
I is a CEO of inner which is that you're

902
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:06,710
trying to look for using zest right well

903
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:08,059
in yeah and so your question is what

904
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:11,410
kind of vulnerabilities are really

905
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:13,789
looking for using exists and it's it's

906
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:15,890
kind of a mixed issue because I'm

907
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:19,010
actually not looking for issues using

908
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:22,129
zest specifically but it's more like

909
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:25,099
using zest I can hard code specific API

910
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:26,300
calls to to occur repeatedly and

911
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:28,610
actually run

912
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,350
non-security tests in them but then the

913
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:32,720
passive scanners will run you know on

914
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:35,120
that traffic and so as a tester

915
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,580
personally this here you get into like

916
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,759
test strategy more where I prefer to

917
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:42,470
have a huge amount of information and

918
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,850
and manually process it and be like that

919
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,410
doesn't matter that doesn't matter that

920
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,180
doesn't matter because I want to I want

921
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:50,899
my situational awareness of what it's

922
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:53,270
doing to be as high as possible so in

923
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:58,580
our case since its API testing a lot of

924
00:37:53,270 --> 00:38:02,120
the vulnerabilities have to do with it

925
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:03,650
could be like tokens and stuff or you

926
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,540
kind of like a back-end type issues

927
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:15,260
where like a buffer buffer issues or

928
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:17,810
integer issues or calculations yes right

929
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,270
yeah yeah I'm using it yeah to kind of

930
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:22,820
expand yeah like you said this the scope

931
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,620
of the testing but that was just with

932
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:27,560
the standalone scripts where it's mostly

933
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:30,589
request based you can also use it to

934
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,660
expand extend what it is alerting by

935
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:34,070
creating a custom passive alerts if

936
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,830
you're like oh this is an issue for our

937
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:39,320
system that doesn't exist in zap yet you

938
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:41,900
can create your own if reg X equals then

939
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,330
alert medium and it'll create alerts for

940
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:48,640
you so you can do whatever you want yeah

941
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:48,640
does that it's your question okay

942
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:53,960
can you mix the zest in Python for

943
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,320
instance or do you just choose one of

944
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,870
them and when would you right good

945
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,280
question I think I tried mixing it and

946
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:04,040
it did not mix the question was if you

947
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:08,840
can mix destined Python zest being kind

948
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:10,430
of the graphical language or script

949
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,740
format and Python you know we know what

950
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:14,899
Python is because there is actually an

951
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:17,899
action available in zest where you can

952
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,040
it says action call script and then you

953
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,690
can call other scripts so you can

954
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,300
actually like nested scripts in if

955
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:25,370
statements but once you're inside the

956
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,790
zest engine if you give it a Python one

957
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:30,109
it won't I won't execute it so if you're

958
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:32,870
in that case then you'd have to

959
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:34,130
basically start with the Python ones at

960
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:37,220
least for now I mean we could always

961
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:38,810
make a an issue request to assignment

962
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,160
and team and say hey I want to I want to

963
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,690
mix script styles

964
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,899
but right now you'd have to pick one and

965
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:46,880
so but they're very different in the

966
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,170
sense that python is a lot more flexible

967
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,910
because you have you know the entire

968
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,680
language at your disposal to do anything

969
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:55,339
you want I think I have one in Python

970
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,069
that scrapes zaps entirely entire

971
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,690
network history table and extracts all

972
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,750
the hashes and compares them and looks

973
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:04,370
for duplicates which is like a really

974
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,020
specific use case that you know I could

975
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:09,040
only do in Python le pry code in

976
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:13,160
JavaScript - where zest couldn't do that

977
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:15,590
but zest since it's a graphic graphical

978
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,319
like scripting format is really easy to

979
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:19,790
create really fast like anywhere in your

980
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,710
network tab you can just right-click on

981
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:24,110
something and click Add to zest script

982
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:27,290
and it's saved in a zest script to

983
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:28,700
replay later whenever you want and so if

984
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:31,029
you're trying to build stuff fast or

985
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:33,560
like just regular API testing that I do

986
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:35,330
zest is really easy to drag-and-drop and

987
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,340
I play with things then you get you know

988
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:38,600
a big list but if you really need to do

989
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,740
something a little more technical than

990
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,140
pythons a good one

991
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,750
set it to your question great question

992
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:47,120

993
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,770

994
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,160

995
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,160
