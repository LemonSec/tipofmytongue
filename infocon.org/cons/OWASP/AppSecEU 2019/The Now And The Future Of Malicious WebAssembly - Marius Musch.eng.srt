00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:08,148
Tenten hi everyone

2
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:12,830
well welcome to my talk it's about now

3
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:15,280
in the future it's about the now the

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,200
future of malicious web assembly and

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,689
well I know HD tuner from will take news

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,009
University once week and this is work

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,580
together with my colleagues Christian

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,270
mess maker

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,860
Martin Johnson Colorado and this is

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:31,610
about our study on near a person

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,410
ecosystem in general amenable more

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,109
focused and on on the current and future

13
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,998
potential abuses of this technology but

14
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:42,379
keep in mind HD student so this might be

15
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:44,769
more of an academic work so one of the

16
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:47,748
things that is always working with is

17
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:49,550
Valley native performance so if you

18
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:51,530
think about something like games in

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:55,068
particular or anything that involves 3d

20
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,749
and there are some attempts like Adobe

21
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:59,210
Flash was popular for a while especially

22
00:00:56,749 --> 00:01:01,969
for games and then we also had the

23
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:05,329
active fix X and Google's Native Client

24
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:07,820
but they are all learn by now they're

25
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:10,399
either deprecated or are scheduled to

26
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,339
end soon so this is not really the

27
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:16,039
future this is the past right what you

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,530
also had was a sandal chase if you ever

29
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:20,060
heard of that it's basically a subset of

30
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,479
JavaScript they did some level

31
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,729
accumulations so that they could speed

32
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,929
up the process if you only use some

33
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:32,299
parts of JavaScript and not others but

34
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,789
that led to fast execution but it still

35
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:37,250
was only like a bending afterwards like

36
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:39,500
so we already had this JavaScript so how

37
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,109
could mean you would make it faster but

38
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,420
it's not like if you they didn't

39
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:46,039
recreated from scratch right so that's

40
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,380
what they actually did this represent me

41
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:51,259
they introduced a whole

42
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,030
to develop so it's been there for over

43
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,580
three years now as you can see it's

44
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,860
quite well supported unity really but

45
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,350
the very important browsers all

46
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:03,200
supported and all those that are widely

47
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:06,080
used so and the clipping is also running

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,820
on on iOS and on Android so you do not

49
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,459
only have desktop applications or the

50
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:14,510
school computers but also on all the

51
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:16,790
Mumbai lines so this is good but well

52
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:21,829
what is it actually on so it's not of a

53
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:23,600
micro language and what it makes in as

54
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,750
an effect is it makes everything faster

55
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,690
right so we have fast the transmission

56
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,060
because the size which is smaller yep

57
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,650
the coding equal encode Indian tribes

58
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,120
will go and represent me it would be

59
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,950
just smaller because it's fine in the

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,239
comment and also the combination is much

61
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,929
faster than everything because they

62
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:47,450
design in a way that it's just well it's

63
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,299
better to optimize competitors who paid

64
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:53,480
you to have expensive positive work so

65
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:56,769
here just as an like a rough estimate

66
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:00,018
this very good series by Alan Clark

67
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:02,570
which is published on like in Mozilla

68
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:05,030
and I've just taken them to delicious

69
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,549
from there so this is a typical amount

70
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,730
of time it takes to like execute the

71
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:12,799
JavaScript code and solve all the steps

72
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,420
involved and obviously it's not like a

73
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,120
total amount of times just like in

74
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,399
relative or like laboratory a piece of

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,980
code and this is how it would look like

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,170
on purpose and you so as you can see

77
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,720
many steps are much faster and other

78
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,149
steps such as let me not there anymore

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,359
because they're not needed and so you

80
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,519
can get a lot of one performs in the end

81
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:36,400
so our site load faster and the things

82
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:40,579
that they do inside this boss faster

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,890
which is great so just to clear up some

84
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:45,230
confusions you wouldn't write web

85
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,328
assembly from scratch so it's slightly

86
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,608
outward or something that you already

87
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:52,519
write code in C++ and in easy

88
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:55,730
ok now export it to the web so what you

89
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:59,000
would for example do is have this cool

90
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,049
game here which is it might be a little

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,300
bit open this is the other one

92
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,330
somebody imported it so as you might be

93
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,400
able to see this is running in my

94
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,830
browser so we have the URL bar at the

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,600
top and what they also want to try

96
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,870
because I don't think I need the hook

97
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,600
time of this look um I want also want to

98
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,370
show you something else because you

99
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,720
might say okay the alphabet this is this

100
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,520
it's mine

101
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,570
maybe 20 years old or something it's

102
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,460
almost this old design this game so what

103
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:37,170
about something you are and I found this

104
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:41,090
one and it works so now we have Doon

105
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:42,750
free running in your browser that's 50

106
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,479
it shows

107
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:58,260
okay the resolution is a bit problematic

108
00:04:45,480 --> 00:05:04,230
because I can't exist in oh yeah this so

109
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:06,270
we can now play in our browser and they

110
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,550
they didn't do much work that you might

111
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,310
maybe change things around a little bit

112
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:14,180
so you depend on something that's only

113
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:17,570
available in dozen years or anything

114
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:22,040
then it might be problematic but mostly

115
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,040
you can take the existing code and

116
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:45,270
another alright so here we are at the

117
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,730
beginning of the game you can see it's a

118
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:52,919
3d game it's like 10 years old and the

119
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:54,960
resolution is but it's only due to the

120
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,789
beyond so yeah the rest of the

121
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,909
presentation will be you speedrunning

122
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,220
again

123
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:04,000
also did you know that you don't have to

124
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,000
stand on the scanner

125
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:24,930
[Music]

126
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:31,580
bioscan looks good but I didn't stand in

127
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:37,349
there anyways um okay this wasn't done

128
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:40,800
let's get back to prison bitch so now it

129
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:42,688
is especially cool for kids who are are

130
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,569
in school if their Chromebooks and they

131
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:47,490
come and start stuff so if you

132
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:48,870
is there a robotics where they cannot

133
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,050
paint if you move three or maybe

134
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:54,090
something less violent I hope okay

135
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,610
so let's get back to the technical stuff

136
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,830
I mean how would you so I don't want to

137
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,979
go into the rep assembly what was in the

138
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,270
structure and everything I only want to

139
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:07,830
show you how you would use it home

140
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:11,188
transcript so in this case here yes you

141
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,330
you already have your wasn't some file

142
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:15,300
on the service of often is just

143
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,279
eccentric publicity and you already have

144
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,800
it on the server and you want now one to

145
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,719
like run the thing in the browser so

146
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,789
what you would do is call this

147
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:26,639
instantiate screaming which is also cool

148
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:29,188
on the cost like it's in a sacred

149
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,050
asynchronous function and Y are the done

150
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:32,639
well for that wasn't file is running

151
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,349
because you can imagine for a game it

152
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,349
might be loud enough large like twenty

153
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:38,878
megabytes for anymore while Donald is

154
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:41,878
running you can also also already

155
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,979
partially compile it so this instance in

156
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,589
streaming is like with this thing on the

157
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,539
side because they create the format for

158
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:50,669
episode me in a way that you can already

159
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,889
start with the computation even if you

160
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:54,779
only have like half of the pyro side and

161
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,930
so that's one of the reason why it's

162
00:07:54,779 --> 00:08:01,080
faster and then you can also see I have

163
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:05,729
this object at the end trial in

164
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:07,729
community okay so you might wonder

165
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:11,188
what's what's this object about well and

166
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:13,620
this these are the functions that I want

167
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:16,020
to import into the episode so what you

168
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,759
need to know is that like in JavaScript

169
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,068
you have the access to all the things

170
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,319
like the window and on and do the

171
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:24,719
console and everything but in that

172
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,550
person you don't so it's very very like

173
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:29,729
isolated from the rest of the browser

174
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,919
and the rest of the world known about so

175
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:34,240
to you if I want to actually from the

176
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,039
represent me code want to write some

177
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,869
to the console then I must make the

178
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,808
console available to the webOS in this

179
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:43,569
case so here I just have important

180
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:47,800
function up here at the top and then

181
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:50,949
redirect in like ten documents so okay

182
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,439
so now we could call on back from the

183
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:55,118
representative out into the JavaScript

184
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:59,019
but what we also need is the other way

185
00:08:55,119 --> 00:09:02,470
around by so or use an example basically

186
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:03,879
all the functions that we export imagine

187
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,629
see very happy pods in heaven it's

188
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:10,540
called all the things that we export we

189
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:12,100
can now call from childhood so it's

190
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,160
important for you to realize that it's

191
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,660
not like oh forget all about the

192
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,219
JavaScript now we're writing our

193
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,618
websites and that person be like that

194
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,749
won't happen these two things complement

195
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:25,329
each other so you might have an idea

196
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:26,769
written that it's very CPU intensive or

197
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:28,479
that you want to speed up because it's

198
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:32,079
called very very lot in the software and

199
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,089
then you can create that impacted in C++

200
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:35,679
or whatever and call it from a child

201
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:38,980
script and then use the result is same

202
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:41,049
as I'm using the result here back in a

203
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,119
child's football so these two things can

204
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:45,269
call into each other right - that's

205
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:50,589
impossible

206
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:52,779
okay so far for the basics another thing

207
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:56,679
I want to clear up because when I

208
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:59,199
discusses the Fox it was up it led to

209
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:03,009
confusion in the past so let me clear it

210
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:04,689
up people artists so one thing you might

211
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:07,119
say when you hear about this new

212
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:09,939
technology is like oh no now I have to

213
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:12,009
wonder about the flows and in my page

214
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:14,439
like oh my god it's already hectic

215
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:17,309
Secession see small stuff so now I have

216
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:19,839
to worry about this - or you might say

217
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:22,329
whatever the stock doesn't really affect

218
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,610
me because my website just doesn't use

219
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:26,859
that person which will probably be true

220
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,220
for most of you websites at the moment

221
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:34,420
because it's not use very vital and then

222
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:38,170
yeah yeah it's kind of true but also the

223
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:40,179
problem is so palpable X mean to trigger

224
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,969
something like a battle over flowing in

225
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:44,589
a represent what would also very likely

226
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,390
already require

227
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,160
code execution so it's not like they're

228
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,170
exposed to the outside

229
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,819
I mean you could imagine a theoretically

230
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,130
place where that assembly what you will

231
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,460
take something directly from the URL or

232
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:59,770
something but hey is not usually you

233
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,380
probably already have an XSS in your

234
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:05,020
page to be able to trigger the buffer

235
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,300
overflow but ever in the lab assembly so

236
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:10,660
I would say at this point you have other

237
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,670
problems in it right cause it has some

238
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,250
protections in case maybe there's some

239
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:18,130
controller and technique G and protected

240
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:20,320
cost X and whatever so I think it's much

241
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:24,610
harder to execute and more southern

242
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,590
platforms so that means I'm not talking

243
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,210
about cross for each unit X where I'm

244
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,970
attacking your website because it uses

245
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:32,680
that assembly no that's not one actually

246
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,170
so what I'm talking about is attacking

247
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,760
your acknowledge any model is they have

248
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,310
to remember your browser most likely

249
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,990
supported by not unless you're using

250
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:44,589
Internet Explorer 11 or something but

251
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:47,800
again then you have other problems so if

252
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,810
I can do it you on to my left side which

253
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,439
might be easier might be hard but I send

254
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:55,329
a link over there then I can execute any

255
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,960
other 70 module that I want right and

256
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:01,960
that will make some attacks most us here

257
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:08,110
or more per file as I will basically

258
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:10,690
shown on the rest of time okay so yes as

259
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,040
an academic I just wondered like how is

260
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,840
the landscape looking what is the

261
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:19,660
ecosystem looks like so we'd have to

262
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:22,180
investigate that per I mean so just a

263
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:25,600
few details maybe it's of interest of

264
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,099
something basically the data collection

265
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,320
is just we crawled a lot lots of

266
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,810
websites we use the lexicon million just

267
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,580
like a popular system website and we

268
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,380
also caught some sub patients their

269
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,480
swords if the only visit the front page

270
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,189
we mention there are websites that have

271
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,440
lots of games but on the front page that

272
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,210
you see just showing you a selection of

273
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,460
all the games in only if you click on

274
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,200
one of them then it actually like loads

275
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,630
the game so if you're nervous the front

276
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,200
pages then you miss most stuff anyways

277
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,770
pain is actually it's not so easy to

278
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,399
collect those girls and

279
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:59,660
if you want to yeah if you're like me

280
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,940
and just want to collect all the better

281
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,160
sending what is to go see what people

282
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,350
actually using a pork and then there are

283
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,410
multiple options so the first one that

284
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,640
you might stumble for me which is that

285
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,949
principle that sometimes is like you

286
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,339
system awesome what you elect so it's

287
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,839
like a we a flag for Chrome and then in

288
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:20,810
the mall that representing what you'll

289
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,610
statically appear on it is the problem

290
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,020
is it just didn't work for me and after

291
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,360
a while I figured out that it only works

292
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,920
back build or Chrome which is a bit

293
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,350
unfortunate because that thing is

294
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,290
routine takes a lot of time to compile

295
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:35,660
and then my viewer on multiple platforms

296
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,399
like I have snag but then the trolling

297
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,350
is running on those machines and yet

298
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,670
suddenly I need to builds because I want

299
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,800
to test it here and then run it there

300
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,689
and then that was that's on it like too

301
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,000
much hassle for me and we have all these

302
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,920
pills constantly updating so the other

303
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,740
thing is you could use this DVD by the

304
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,199
script mouse which you may be used to

305
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,880
intercept all the JavaScript housing but

306
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,640
you can also use 10:00 to 7:00 at the

307
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,110
sendee but it also has some drawbacks so

308
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,390
basically in the end I just wrote my own

309
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,130
wrapper around all the JavaScript

310
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,810
functions like the initiates feeling

311
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,360
that we've seen before and then knocks

312
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:10,399
it to some back-end and I've just

313
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,170
included that here because um after we

314
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,720
published Eddie but I got many questions

315
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,319
about like how how can you also like do

316
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,510
something like that

317
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,410
and then in the end I just decided like

318
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:23,540
I put this in github the small arm like

319
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,459
this is create this wrapper script with

320
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,339
some happy to hear that just visitors

321
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:29,420
outside and runs through anyway so if

322
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:31,180
you ever want you to do something like

323
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,770
that

324
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,380
okay so what did we find

325
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:40,040
well not so much so remember we visited

326
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:43,399
1 million sites and about 3.5 million

327
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:47,060
pages and we found around 2000 a percent

328
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:49,760
in modules ok but then of these only

329
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:58,339
about 150 were actually distinct so like

330
00:14:49,760 --> 00:15:00,230
where did these spawn by 2 foot and some

331
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:02,089
of these motifs were quite popular so if

332
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,640
there was one man who actually was on

333
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:05,910
350 pages is who's here and then other

334
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,250
modest verges

335
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,650
like never saw them again so who's 87

336
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,980
what this just seems like a one-off

337
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,770
thing

338
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,810
that's not reusable and yeah because

339
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,569
like I said if she's gonna be nice lots

340
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,829
lots lots lots of graphs and stuff so I

341
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,930
just do it in here

342
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:24,870
here we can see that the more popular

343
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:27,479
pages we're on the very left here the

344
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:30,450
100 falls in most popular ones in the

345
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,180
school these are the least popular so we

346
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:35,880
see there's like a slight rent to that

347
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,890
the more popular pages also use more

348
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:43,110
represent your just write it out first

349
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:44,699
oh but it's not like so it's distributed

350
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,530
around that so people are using it also

351
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:50,820
on less popular sites is what I'm trying

352
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:52,530
to say then how much are you using it so

353
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,300
the question is I mean you could have a

354
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,550
bad assembly module in the page but this

355
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,530
is like an important part of page or is

356
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,469
it just like with anything that you

357
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:03,000
actually don't really that's kind of

358
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:07,110
hard to investigate without looking at

359
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,630
each individual site manually but I just

360
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:12,810
did some quick measurements so we have

361
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,880
the smallest motor was only 8 bytes so

362
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:18,359
that might also already do guess about

363
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,270
what that might be and then artists were

364
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:25,890
like in the range of 20 megabytes or

365
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:28,230
more and just comparing them you can see

366
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:31,189
that the JavaScript code is still much

367
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,970
much larger I know that's biased because

368
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,440
javascript is like a textual

369
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,700
representation in a cell for you

370
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,440
represent me finally

371
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,350
so we expected that the city would be

372
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,190
small but still it's like order of

373
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,600
magnitude smaller and so I would say

374
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:52,020
most of the web still live in JavaScript

375
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:54,360
so fastly also we wanted to find out how

376
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:57,500
much teach you is using but assembly

377
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,540
compare each other so on this graph is

378
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:03,390
relative so so the bar in the very left

379
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,819
means this website used basically zero

380
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,670
percent of the time was spent in

381
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:11,189
represent the computation so basically

382
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:13,740
just using javascript all the time and

383
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:16,810
on the other hand on the very right hand

384
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,480
side we have our websites that use up to

385
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:21,940
on honey sending this view time spent

386
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,890
exclusively in represent people so they

387
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,880
don't execute JavaScript anymore a very

388
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:30,460
little and you have to keep in mind this

389
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,800
was involved is an action so we had some

390
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,260
crawler was unsupervised and just left

391
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,570
visiting websites and you did not click

392
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,340
anywhere or something so most of the

393
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,550
games where you also expect the heavy

394
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:53,260
CPU usage whatever may be stuck at the

395
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:55,870
menu but nobody did it they apply one

396
00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:00,820
more graph and then we're back to more

397
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:02,709
let's say don't work applications of a

398
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:07,000
person where you will see what they're

399
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:09,280
actually doing with it but maintain this

400
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,130
thing is a bit complicated on but this

401
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,960
huge I think here is one cluster where

402
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,690
we have seen lots of lots of price which

403
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,270
were basically all the same and this

404
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:24,520
thing here is one cluster and then this

405
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:27,070
thing here so yes you can see we had the

406
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,360
beginning I mean mm what was then you

407
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,370
checked if they're unique and it was

408
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,320
only 150 and then they also classes that

409
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,270
Wilson Metis and then it turns out their

410
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,909
own you know by 11 justice of really

411
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,250
Christine stuff so it's it's not that

412
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:41,440
much out there but so far it didn't

413
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,720
really help us right so we're not that

414
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,940
much wise II just haven't looked at this

415
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,550
in an aggravated fashion and we see

416
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,420
later and the citizen stuff but like

417
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:54,100
what are people actually to me here so

418
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,990
all the statistics and stuff didn't help

419
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,179
I actually had to manually analyze more

420
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:01,090
than 150 modules and the websites that

421
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,940
were reducing that and I labeled them

422
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:06,520
into different categories so let's start

423
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,380
with the less interesting ones on there

424
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,020
were something I which is quite unique

425
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,610
where people just let me try experiments

426
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,920
with representing so that was a sneak

427
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,990
background animation written and

428
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,210
representing stuff but nothing really of

429
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:22,600
value there and then I found out that a

430
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,420
quite a lot of libraries or let's say

431
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,060
there were a few libraries which we

432
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:30,330
you stand on many sites support some the

433
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:33,179
draco library is sports decoding 3d

434
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,429
models and you might not even be aware

435
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,460
that in this episode you include some

436
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:40,620
library from github one on your page

437
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,630
and then under the hood it uses citizen

438
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,429
but it's not like there was some

439
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,470
developer that's at all I want to try

440
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,490
the school that was in Dino and other if

441
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,010
you didn't know it's just some

442
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,940
third-party and easy sauce not that it's

443
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,830
risky

444
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,990
there were also some I would just called

445
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,480
test armor people like try to test the

446
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,580
pep assembly is available so you could

447
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,510
do something like check if the people

448
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:06,720
send the API is available in JavaScript

449
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:09,390
but people don't see to trusted with and

450
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,250
so here is the smallest possible that

451
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,410
was in module that you could create um

452
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:16,560
that is still valid through the doesn't

453
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:20,280
read and we had lots of sites like one

454
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,950
in fifty of these which execute I'll try

455
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,600
to instantiate this module and see if

456
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,210
there were any errors and if there are

457
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,679
then maybe something else so you can use

458
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:32,850
it just as a test in purpose and is

459
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:35,070
really really smaller more interesting

460
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:37,560
me there were lots of games out there so

461
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,659
I can recommend the to that's take point

462
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,000
on the left and it's little IO on the

463
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,610
right these are quite fun but they're

464
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,380
also more out there and so people are

465
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,479
obviously using like I've shown you to

466
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,100
me this is one of the exams that we

467
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,000
actually want to see you right so that's

468
00:20:50,100 --> 00:21:00,300
good stuff but unfortunately we also had

469
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,340
some other stuff wrong right but for

470
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,590
that I have to do another digression

471
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,290
because I'm not really sure how big you

472
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:12,780
are all are in the topic of

473
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:15,690
cryptocurrencies so just one slide about

474
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,250
mining mining is the process of of

475
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:20,580
minting new points though imagine

476
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,650
something like Bitcoin and it works in a

477
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,689
way that you take the current state of

478
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,760
your network whatever that is and you

479
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,920
add a random random number to it that it

480
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,980
just choose to treat your liking you try

481
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,840
to emulate the half of all the stuff and

482
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,270
basically compare it to a given target

483
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,139
so you check if it's a very

484
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:41,030
very small number that hash and though

485
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,650
if you if you choosing a random number

486
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:45,139
that luckily leads into a hash that has

487
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:48,230
lots and lots of leading zeros then you

488
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,630
would basically have mined a block maybe

489
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:54,050
you heard that term before so it's just

490
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:57,380
not see lots of computation why would

491
00:21:54,050 --> 00:22:00,980
you do that well if you if you're able

492
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:03,020
to do this process correctly and get

493
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,550
this credit low number then it would get

494
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:08,240
you points basically for fee

495
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:09,530
as a result and why you shouldn't do

496
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,570
that or what's what's the problem lies

497
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,610
not everybody to me that is because

498
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,740
there are some customers obviously so

499
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,419
you need to hover and more importantly

500
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:21,140
you also need the electricity so you pay

501
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:22,580
for the electricity is usually and like

502
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,500
you wouldn't have one computer but it

503
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,080
would have this giant farm of Asics and

504
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,790
stuff so you would be profits are

505
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,939
severely limited by the amount of

506
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:33,290
computation that we pay for so name is

507
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,120
some clever people came up with yet you

508
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,280
well maybe somebody asking paper be

509
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,489
electricity right so if I have people

510
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,309
visiting my website and they run this

511
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,559
miner in the browser for me that's the

512
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:47,420
critical checking was all about and then

513
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:50,629
I don't have so then they are in the

514
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,070
electricity right so this is the crypto

515
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:55,610
checking and surprise ignore

516
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:58,520
unsurprisingly below we found that the

517
00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:01,520
most popular usage of represent II was

518
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,309
implementing a more narrow minor for the

519
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,570
browser so then people would visit your

520
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:09,790
website and then they would run

521
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:12,200
representing mine in the background and

522
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:14,120
basically all the computation would not

523
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,950
be for the benefit of the user but

524
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,610
rather somebody that included it on the

525
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:21,140
on this website and also you have to

526
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:24,860
keep in mind so we found it on around

527
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:28,820
900 websites but we did our measurement

528
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:32,360
around here so this is one arrow versus

529
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:34,309
to us voila so as you can see there were

530
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,290
some points in time where whenever was

531
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:39,470
really worth a lot lot more than it is

532
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:41,809
now so there were reports um like the

533
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,460
round here from way more websites like

534
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:47,629
over two thousand or something next to

535
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,440
one video so this is already elected the

536
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,080
big chunk already

537
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:55,820
path but you can still see it on a lot

538
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:57,889
of websites and also if you ever heard

539
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,870
of coin life which was it was like the

540
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,510
largest provider of these mining

541
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:04,389
services they shut down this year so the

542
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:07,220
numbers were probably dropped by now

543
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:09,290
Purdue but who knows what happens in

544
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:14,630
this currency market or if what ever

545
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:16,159
ever will give more value again so yeah

546
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,290
we found these miners and they also

547
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,840
explain type of graph that I showed in

548
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:24,760
the beginning remember with the CPU this

549
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,720
basic the same graph just with another

550
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,460
notation on the axis so this is a

551
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,830
logarithmic axis just to screw with you

552
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:33,920
know and so that you can see these

553
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,540
smaller numbers better so basically what

554
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,310
you had before with the representing

555
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,159
that was using a hundred percent of the

556
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:42,110
CPU that was the minus one it's

557
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,880
basically what the slides same so the

558
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:46,219
gray gray stuff is the minus and the

559
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:49,850
vice of the service like all the other

560
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:52,340
categories that light you see and if you

561
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:56,510
have no user interaction then it's the -

562
00:24:52,340 --> 00:25:01,060
that really use the CPU okay so far so

563
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:03,410
good we also had some other cases so

564
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:07,460
people who are also using rebus me2

565
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:10,270
obfuscated code um and you only found a

566
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:14,710
few service of those are so here we have

567
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:17,600
this variable so the script here is this

568
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,850
normal page Houston but what you need to

569
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,860
know is that it was given in the DEP

570
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,449
assembly module so you have this

571
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,280
university model you have this memory

572
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,090
section so all these things are

573
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:32,810
contained and they use these memory

574
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:34,639
sections to like slice up and hide in

575
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:37,179
mucho bebés anymore so you might have

576
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,790
one module for the like the first line

577
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:42,590
like this one of the medical bundles

578
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:44,180
initiated and then yeah one representing

579
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,679
module better you are elbows hidden and

580
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,420
then another one that close the script

581
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,920
and so you have to combine all these

582
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,990
modules on the right order and then you

583
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,910
put only then you would get the scoop

584
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,550
that actually this later inserted into

585
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,740
the doll so it's not it's not that super

586
00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:00,800
hidden because at some point you have to

587
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,630
add it to the dominant in this absurd

588
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,490
but it's hard like if you mention

589
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:07,880
something like an app de l'opéra son I'm

590
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:09,830
a detection engine without it's a bit

591
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,100
harder to exceed what's happening there

592
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,449
because it's the scripts are not like

593
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,159
transmitted over the network yes

594
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,910
JavaScript but actually did another

595
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:22,070
person and he also had a one what he

596
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,290
would that have been made an actual site

597
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:26,179
and nothing else so there was just this

598
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,220
motor sitting around that could be used

599
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,750
for encrypting and decrypting stuff but

600
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,110
it wasn't used so that wasn't bit

601
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:43,640
suspicious but who knows what they plan

602
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:46,070
for okay so this basically a huge

603
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,410
summary and as you can see unfortunately

604
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:50,480
the cases that I would label as

605
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:53,420
malicious this is the mining and the

606
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,060
obfuscation together because thanks to

607
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:58,000
the National of mine makeup forum on and

608
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:02,360
off you gotta send listen to the Viper

609
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:11,960
so yeah since I take this for about

610
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:14,629
things technology very young yeah so I

611
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,280
just have a few notes about the future I

612
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:18,980
mean the talk was about the now in the

613
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:21,050
country but as you can imagine I don't

614
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:23,950
have a crystal ball so the table

615
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:27,110
obviously mostly focus on the present

616
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:29,210
but I still try to make drawing the

617
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:32,990
picture how or where this could be

618
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:35,450
moving if people are really in a

619
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:37,430
malicious mindset I would say so what

620
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,980
we've already seen is this the embedded

621
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,750
HTML childhood something she just used

622
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:46,100
that assembly to hey I stopped very

623
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:50,000
person and then super fashion right but

624
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:51,889
then we could also mention like you

625
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,330
could do something unpack your

626
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,610
encryption

627
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:57,949
routine interpersonal just a very small

628
00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:00,409
thing and it basically in there all the

629
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:03,680
static analysis of JavaScript if you are

630
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:06,440
unable to determine the very

631
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,030
descriptions of truthful sunny so

632
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,720
initially up the system is used to

633
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:13,149
analyze JavaScript like unique

634
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,030
ten books or something and it's unaware

635
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:18,850
of the profession disappear now since to

636
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:22,600
you so they could really indirectly

637
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:24,789
static down analysis at this some part

638
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:30,158
of the code that these roundups and gray

639
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:32,470
and what's more well you could just in

640
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,620
the future right you exploit K 16 C++

641
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:39,159
those exploits and then exporting to

642
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,658
member sending so you could imagine an

643
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:43,450
attack that is just no JavaScript

644
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:47,080
running on the page and the full of by

645
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:48,940
chains run interpersonally so yeah that

646
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,600
would make it even harder for exceed at

647
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:54,159
least existing analysis system and also

648
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,830
you have to keep in mind I didn't

649
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,600
mention is really important to have a

650
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,000
semi is just harder to me twice so it's

651
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,459
a slightly binary formats of this mode

652
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,770
reverse engineering involved is just

653
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,980
slowly solo double competitor JavaScript

654
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:11,139
so it will also mean that this morning

655
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,840
world involved for many analysts

656
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:17,289
compared to maybe a JavaScript export

657
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,980
and then one thing I came up with it's

658
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,780
just an idea

659
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:23,070
who knows that whatever happens you have

660
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:25,120
some genius malicious person out there

661
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:26,740
but that's a shortly in the beginning

662
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,539
these things can be call into each other

663
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,740
right so we have charged up 15 cause

664
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:30,179
there are so many functions in the other

665
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,220
way around

666
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:36,400
so what you could do and I cut this into

667
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,720
point code um did you basically cause

668
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,720
from one end to the other all the time

669
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:43,390
and really imagine an attack that's not

670
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,860
really this nigel javascript exploit

671
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,100
more better send expert was actually

672
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:50,260
only parts that were exist of one or the

673
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,039
other and they constantly call into each

674
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:56,350
other so that will be if you're writing

675
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,570
an analysis system or some defense

676
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,580
mechanism would make it really hard for

677
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,320
you because you know you have to analyze

678
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,750
javascript and that was 70 at the same

679
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,799
time and then like all these calls into

680
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:12,429
each other right okay just some like

681
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:15,418
this what he had the best beeping smell

682
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:15,419
right to my control room

683
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:25,730
so we see an exciting new feature packed

684
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:31,280
up for attackers and well currently our

685
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:33,410
sites usually using four - savvy it

686
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,379
enables some level of the station

687
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:43,760
techniques because you're not running a

688
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:46,760
low level code if you ever create a

689
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,650
defensive system remember that the self

690
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:55,220
is out there so keep that in mind okay

691
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:57,560
and well your process now or if you

692
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:00,340
don't or if I'm not able to answer now

693
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,340
you can also have

694
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,409
