1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,260
hello everyone thank you very much for

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,840
coming here today

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,670
my name is Jared Overson and I'm gonna

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,029
be talking about credential stuffing and

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,380
I know as security professionals or

6
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:21,430
people who at least care about security

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:24,038
a lot of us have a tendency to kind of

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:27,160
brush off credential stuffing because to

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,779
us it's it's an easily solvable problem

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,150
for us not to be affected

11
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,680
we just don't reuse our passwords and

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,410
ideally enable multi-factor

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,660
authentication wherever possible so the

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,940
the point of this talk is to is to

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:43,120
hopefully describe to you the depth of

16
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,370
the problem and show why it is a massive

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,538
problem and why it's also really fun

18
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,680
problem tackle a front problem to tackle

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,989
because of how sophisticated the

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,539
attackers are so for anyone who needs a

21
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:57,640
refresher credential stuffing is the

22
00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:00,489
replay of breached username and

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,469
credential pairs across many sites in

24
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:05,289
order to find out who is reusing

25
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:06,190
passwords pretty simple right it's a

26
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:08,350
four step process

27
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,640
you gotta get credentials you've got to

28
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,750
automate the login because you're not

29
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,090
gonna sit there and type in all those

30
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,799
credentials by hand I need to defeat

31
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,320
whatever automation defense has already

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,360
exist and there is inevitably something

33
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,889
that you need to defeat and they need to

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,150
distribute globally so the numbers I

35
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,400
have to present to you hopefully

36
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:30,810
illustrate why this is an exploding

37
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,070
problem credential stuffing is fueled by

38
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,079
spills of credentials credential spills

39
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,939
the company I work at shape security

40
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,649
publishes a report every year the

41
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:40,720
credential spill report that we track a

42
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,880
lot of these things and and try to

43
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,158
gather information about them last year

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,740
in 2018 we recorded over 1 billion

45
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,439
credentials spilled on the public or

46
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,229
dark web that is a lot of credentials to

47
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:55,898
fuel credential stuffing we also

48
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:58,149
recorded our largest day of attacks ever

49
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:59,829
at 2 billion plus attacks and then we

50
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:02,950
also in January of this year recorded

51
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:06,100
our largest attack campaign ever at 3

52
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:11,050
billion attacks against one URL in one

53
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:12,549
week so thank you I'm going to go into

54
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,510
three things here are going to go into

55
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,430
an attack detail so describing how

56
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,379
these attacks actually occur how much

57
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,909
they actually cost if you wanted to put

58
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,319
on your black hat tonight maybe you're

59
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,929
pissed at your boss and you want to go

60
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,819
home and be an attacker you can go home

61
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,590
and with the money in your pocket gets

62
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,119
started tonight then we're going to go

63
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,310
over how credential has stuffing has

64
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,650
evolved the state of it now and then

65
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,680
where account takeovers in general are

66
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,500
evolving too so before I get started on

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,010
the actual detail and cost I need to

68
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,480
differentiate manual work and automation

69
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,578
any attack out there steps between

70
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,920
manual work and automation frequently

71
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,959
there's never an attack that you can

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,119
just walk up to blindfolded smash a

73
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,310
button and have millions and millions of

74
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,139
dollars pouring all over you those just

75
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,440
don't exist that would be an example of

76
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,879
a 100% automated attack and those just

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,720
don't really exist you can come close

78
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,608
but it's not quite that at that point so

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,400
automation could be anything from a port

80
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,930
scan or searching google or or

81
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,389
automating a browser or anything like

82
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,840
that stuff that allows you to do the

83
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:20,310
boring and low value stuff trivially

84
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,870
over and over and over and over again

85
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,690
you're not gonna sit there and scan

86
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,400
through 65,000 ports by hand because

87
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,319
most of them will just not amount to

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,290
much so you need to automate that stuff

89
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,560
in order for attacks to be economically

90
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,720
viable and that's where manual work and

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,239
automation come into play so manual work

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,699
is the stuff that you do when the value

93
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,590
is there automation is what you have to

94
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,510
resort to when the value is not there

95
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,879
the stuff I'm going to be talking about

96
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,220
this entire presentation and in general

97
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,459
is all hinging around cost versus value

98
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,859
if the value is there the cost of these

99
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:59,549
attacks can be adjusted in order to make

100
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:03,090
them in order to make them continue so

101
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:05,730
there are no defenses in place cost is

102
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,340
virtually zero you can use existing

103
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,340
strategies existing tools existing

104
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,949
tactics you can almost press a button in

105
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,209
a more money pouring all over you

106
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:16,829
because a lot of the problems have

107
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,228
already been solved this is the same

108
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,310
thing with with technology in general

109
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:22,048
things that might be new at the start

110
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,409
becomes easier as more people and

111
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:28,260
understand them as you add any defenses

112
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:29,050
in place you force a generational shift

113
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,819
for these attacks

114
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,020
now it could be something homegrown it

115
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:34,240
could be a vendor could be anything else

116
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,549
no matter what you put in place it's

117
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,680
going to stop virtually every single one

118
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,539
of your attackers if only for a little

119
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,599
bit because you've just changed what's

120
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:45,310
going on and this is what you want to do

121
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:47,800
over and over and over again until you

122
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,430
get to the point where you tip the cost

123
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,840
versus value justification in your favor

124
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,490
this is where you need to be with

125
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,560
defenses this is this is what we're

126
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,659
doing with the firewalls application

127
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,919
DDoS stuff CAPTCHAs whatever else we're

128
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:01,750
trying to add layers and layers of

129
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,000
defenses on it until it just no longer

130
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,310
make sense to attack us anymore the

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,550
problem there is that same thing with

132
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:12,909
computing mobile phones machine learning

133
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:15,909
storage space whatever else is that over

134
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:19,270
time the cost of entry into all these

135
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:20,530
technologies just reduces naturally same

136
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,719
thing I was talking about before people

137
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,030
understand it better the tools become

138
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:26,889
cheaper the hardware becomes optimized

139
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,109
for these use cases it just becomes

140
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,300
naturally cheaper over time and you

141
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,150
couple that with the fact that every

142
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,819
single one of our responsibilities is to

143
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,489
grow value in our company and we have

144
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:42,009
this dynamic pulling far far away from

145
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,349
where we want to where we want to be we

146
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:46,659
have always cost of the attacks reducing

147
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:49,389
and the value of successful attacks

148
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:54,909
increasing this is fueling rapid and

149
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:57,520
rapid iteration so how much does it cost

150
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:59,940
to actually issue a credential stuffing

151
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,318
attack first you got to get financials

152
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,719
this is one of those things that used to

153
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,610
actually be somewhat costly you needed

154
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,990
to run in the right groups you needed to

155
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,460
know the right people you used to

156
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,650
purchase these credentials you needed to

157
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,779
breach the data yourself now you can go

158
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,909
to a site like raid forums comm and

159
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:19,210
download nearly a terabyte of

160
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:21,009
credentials for eight credits eight

161
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,779
credits is about two dollars and fifty

162
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:24,190
cents which is more than I had on the

163
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:26,620
account at this point in time

164
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,180
but yeah all it was doing was hiding a

165
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,409
torrent link so you could just go on any

166
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,110
other post that had that torrent link

167
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:34,240
and grab that for free so this is this

168
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,460
was the post that announced collections

169
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,490
one two three four five and the

170
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,979
anti-public mega leak we

171
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,569
might have heard of collection one Troy

172
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:44,219
hunt wrote about that whenever he writes

173
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,560
about something like that everyone knows

174
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,960
about it which strange though everyone

175
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,569
knows about collection one but the the

176
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,008
other nine hundred gigabytes of data

177
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:55,050
that was announced like a week or two

178
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:57,360
later it's like we already heard about

179
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,789
collection one it's no big deal this is

180
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,819
a monstrous number of credentials that

181
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:05,219
includes dumps of upwards of ten years

182
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:07,650
ago basically every breach that we've

183
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,449
heard about is in a dump like this so

184
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,929
you can get started with all the

185
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:13,979
credentials that have been spilled in

186
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,889
for virtually nothing but acting for

187
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:19,440
literally nothing and this amounted to

188
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:21,120
things about upwards of 20 billion

189
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,340
Crenshaw pairs I think it actually

190
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,880
amounted to about 2.3 billion unique

191
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:29,448
credentials but still that's 2.3 billion

192
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,219
usernames and passwords to start with

193
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:34,500
next up it's to automate the login

194
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,229
because we're certainly not going to be

195
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,060
sitting through and typing in 2.3

196
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:42,780
billion email addresses and passwords by

197
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,520
hand it's it's just not it's not the

198
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,679
success rate is not high enough to make

199
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,849
that worthwhile so we use a tool like

200
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,770
this this is a browser automation studio

201
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:55,889
this is one of the more advanced

202
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:58,109
automation tools I generally consider

203
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,300
the automation tools to exist in kind of

204
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,190
two camps there are Forellis for web

205
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,990
automation there are tools that automate

206
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,840
sites you own and tools that automate

207
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,880
sites you don't tools that automate

208
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,190
sites you don't I generate classify as

209
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,469
attack tools tools that automate sites

210
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,250
you own our testing QA developer tools

211
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:17,840
things like that

212
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:19,650
this tool includes things like

213
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,198
integrations for CAPTCHA solvers

214
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,479
switching fingerprints rotating through

215
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,370
proxies stuff like that I would place

216
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,960
this squarely in the attack tool

217
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,789
category despite the fact that it is a

218
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,469
general purpose tool that you can use

219
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,968
for anything and it is very very cool

220
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,640
and advanced you can see on the

221
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:37,399
left-hand side it actually has a visual

222
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,990
logic organizer so that you can

223
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,200
basically drag and drop your way to a

224
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,730
fully automated web site very easily and

225
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,709
if you weren't so inclined to actually

226
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,720
do that yourself you could go to a site

227
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,729
lick up were calm and just pay somebody

228
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,290
else to do it for you there are people

229
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,199
who sell their surface service

230
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:58,259
is configuring tools like this for us

231
00:08:55,199 --> 00:09:01,609
once $10 an hour and I would I would

232
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:05,009
guess that you could probably configure

233
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:07,800
average low defense sites in about three

234
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:09,750
to five hours so it's about thirty fifty

235
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,240
dollars for somebody to develop this for

236
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,610
you and for other tools you can find

237
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,759
pre-configured configurations that you

238
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,589
could purchase for about the same price

239
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:22,440
next up you want to defeat whatever

240
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:24,750
existing defenses there are and there is

241
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,550
always something in your way

242
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,459
you've probably seen something like this

243
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:32,758
this is Google's reCAPTCHA version 2

244
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:34,500
version 1 was the squiggly letters and

245
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,329
the numbers where they claim that you

246
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,850
are transcribing books or something like

247
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:41,189
that this one will give you the swirly

248
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,339
swirl and the green checkmark if you

249
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:46,110
look okay if you don't look okay then

250
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,970
Google will have you help train its

251
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,459
machine learning algorithms to find out

252
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,380
what a crosswalk is or a street sign or

253
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,359
something like that and if you do a good

254
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,670
enough job there then it'll think that

255
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,769
you're okay and it'll allow you to go

256
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,449
through now a defense like this is

257
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:02,430
actually does they do a really really

258
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:05,880
good job at identifying sketchy behavior

259
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:08,399
the problem is though is that everyone

260
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,470
uses this and it's free and it's

261
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,149
everywhere now if you were an attacker

262
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,649
or a burglar or something like that and

263
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:16,199
you were presented with one neighborhood

264
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:19,139
that all had really really great locks

265
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,949
all had individually awesome locks and

266
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:21,959
then you had another neighbor

267
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:24,660
neighborhood that all had the same

268
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,819
really really good lock which lock would

269
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,199
you target penetrating first the one

270
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:31,160
that got you an entire neighborhood

271
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:33,510
right this is what incentivizes

272
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,730
developers and and people in the

273
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:38,819
ecosystem to build tools to bypass

274
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,790
common defenses this is death by CAPTCHA

275
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:44,339
this is one of dozens of CAPTCHA solvers

276
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,050
that exist they're actually so many

277
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:48,660
CAPTCHA solvers that if you google

278
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,519
captcha solver Google will propagate the

279
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,779
top ten CAPTCHA solvers to its answer

280
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,970
box because there's just so much

281
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:55,500
information written about them so you

282
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,600
don't even have to be some sort of shady

283
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,660
attacker to do this you can Google your

284
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,939
way to an attack tonight so this is a

285
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,649
buck thirty nine a dollar thirty nine

286
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:06,599
four one thousand solve

287
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:09,329
CAPTCHAs not even captcha attempts this

288
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,619
is just 1,000 solve CAPTCHAs and it's 99

289
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,998
cents if you're a gold member so if you

290
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:15,959
do this a lot you should probably

291
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:21,809
consider upgrading but it includes

292
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:23,008
libraries for Ruby Python Java node PHP

293
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:24,959
whatever else you can hook this up

294
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:26,459
slapping API key and you've got CAPTCHA

295
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,689
solved it's not it's not a complicated

296
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,089
problem anymore

297
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:32,160
but if that's too expensive you can use

298
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,660
something like this which is a tool that

299
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,699
has a free version that allows you to

300
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,350
solve CAPTCHAs locally not even

301
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:39,599
delegating to an API or anything like

302
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:43,199
that the success rate is a little bit

303
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,569
lower but again this is a cost versus

304
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:47,008
value play issuing traffic sending

305
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:48,569
traffic is actually really really cheap

306
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:51,389
so even if you have a success rate as

307
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:53,160
low as 50% all you need to do is just

308
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:56,059
double the requests you're sending and

309
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,829
you get the output you're looking for

310
00:11:56,059 --> 00:12:00,779
next up is to distribute globally

311
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:02,758
because of one of the the early defenses

312
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:04,350
we had in place IP rate limiting if you

313
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,999
were issuing three billion attacks from

314
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,100
a single IP address you would stick out

315
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:10,649
like a sore thumb and you'd be knocked

316
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,089
down very very quickly so you have to

317
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:13,879
distribute your traffic to make it look

318
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:16,800
like it's coming all across the globe

319
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:19,079
this is another thing that used to be

320
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,748
expensive you used to need to have to

321
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,819
manage your own proxies you needed to

322
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:25,889
get your own BOTS or botnet the can

323
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:29,189
proxy traffic all around the world now

324
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:31,620
you can just sign up at AWS or Azure or

325
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:33,179
Google Google cloud and get your code

326
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,790
distributed all around the globe

327
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:38,910
in perfectly scalable environments for

328
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,769
almost literally nothing you can up

329
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,949
Google functions and the first million

330
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:45,389
invitations are free so you the ability

331
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:47,029
to spin up code that looks like it's

332
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:50,059
coming from all over the place as

333
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:53,790
virtually not an issue anymore

334
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:55,499
so the cost of issuing a

335
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:59,219
hundred-thousand account takeover

336
00:12:55,499 --> 00:13:02,850
attempts can be tried for less than 200

337
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,860
US dollars so again with cost it's zero

338
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,559
dollars for the billions of credentials

339
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,420
it can be zero dollars if you want to

340
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:10,889
configure these tools yourself but time

341
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,670
is money and you might as well just pay

342
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:16,620
for it so you pay 50 bucks if you want a

343
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,640
hundred thousand solve CAPTCHAs you're

344
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,320
going to pay paying

345
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:23,130
thirty nine dollars for death by CAPTCHA

346
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,110
or $99 if you're a gold member and you

347
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,300
can get global IP addresses for nothing

348
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,770
but you can spend a few bucks to tailor

349
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,620
your demographics and get higher quality

350
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:33,900
higher reputation IP addresses very very

351
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,290
easily so that is less than two-tenths

352
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:40,620
of a penny for each individual account

353
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,689
takeover attempt now the cost is

354
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,630
irrelevant unless we understand the

355
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:51,350
value so the rate of return is

356
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:53,270
calculated by the value of our goal

357
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,800
multiplied by the chance of success

358
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:57,510
divided by the cost subtracting our

359
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,790
initial investment you get our rate of

360
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,830
return so for a cost of two tenths of a

361
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,709
penny a success rate of what we've seen

362
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:07,290
between point two and two percent for

363
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,660
credential stuffing attacks and a range

364
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:12,170
of values between what I've seen between

365
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:15,719
two dollars and several hundred dollars

366
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,790
value is is generally lower for low

367
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,220
value of things like forums a lot of

368
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,810
musical artists forums those those

369
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,250
accounts will exist they're not going to

370
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,979
be very valuable they'll sell for

371
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:29,220
pennies or a couple dollars fortnight

372
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,840
skins will go for for a few dollars to

373
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,960
tens of dollars depending on the rarity

374
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:36,450
of the skins as sites that deal with

375
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,830
money especially money transfer go for a

376
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,340
lot because that helps in money

377
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,590
laundering

378
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,240
so these accounts are worth a lot and

379
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,090
you mash all these up together and you

380
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,610
have a rate of return at the low end of

381
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:49,830
a hundred percent not the other at the

382
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:54,060
high end hundreds of thousands of

383
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:58,710
percent this is a phenomenal value for

384
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:01,619
anyone to do and it costs so little to

385
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:04,560
get started this is what is fueling the

386
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:08,330
the attack evolution because the value

387
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:12,900
is so so high and the cost is so

388
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:14,400
stupidly low so the next step is we're

389
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,370
gonna go over how credential stuffing

390
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,680
has evolved so because of the cost res

391
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:22,140
value is so out of whack no matter what

392
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,540
defense you put in place they're going

393
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:27,810
to want to bypass it because the value

394
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,610
is still there it doesn't disappear so

395
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,989
at the start because it's important to

396
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,670
just be as cheap as human

397
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,560
be possible you start up with something

398
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:36,029
like curl or double you get you don't

399
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,399
need to do anything fancy if there are

400
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:40,200
no defenses in place you just issue your

401
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,520
posts or post requests analyze the

402
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,860
response and determine whether or not

403
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,860
you got a successful login or a failed

404
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,709
login then you get tools that are

405
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:52,950
optimized for attacks of that nature

406
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:56,130
like sentry MBA sentry MBA is a

407
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:58,020
relatively ancient tool and in the scope

408
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:00,930
of technology I think it was released

409
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:04,649
around 2009 but it's optimized for these

410
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:07,319
types of attacks specifically it makes

411
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:10,440
it easier to ingest combo lists combo

412
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:14,010
lists are text files of username and

413
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,779
password combinations so like a email

414
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,610
address username and then a literal

415
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:19,770
colon and then a password and a new line

416
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,410
these are optimized for ingestion by

417
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,670
tools like this so if you if you start

418
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,620
for combo list you'll find a lots of

419
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,360
information on combo lists and if you're

420
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,100
looking to figure out how tools are

421
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,600
easily configured for combo lists you

422
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,750
can look for those sorts of

423
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,209
configurations so it also evolved over

424
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,890
time to get past some future defenses

425
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:39,750
that eventually put into place like we

426
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,959
talked about the first defense that we

427
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,390
really had was IP rate limiting which

428
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,219
I'm sure everyone here has been in a

429
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,290
situation where we've had two IP rate

430
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,360
limit or block an IP at some point in

431
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,370
time and we probably also remember how

432
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,980
futile that was because of how trivial

433
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,899
it is to get around things like that so

434
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,490
the one of the first defenses one of the

435
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:02,100
first attacker responses was just

436
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,530
rotating through proxies very very easy

437
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,439
to do in general even without cloud

438
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:10,379
services but you also get to the the

439
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,839
point where you have services like

440
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,079
Akamai or whatever else dealing with IP

441
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:18,270
reputation how a legitimate how

442
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,970
consistently legitimate is traffic

443
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,020
coming from a particular IP address

444
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,870
attackers know stuff like that so then

445
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,910
they start proxying through legitimate

446
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:29,428
residential home networks via a service

447
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,670
like the loominatee network anyone ever

448
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:34,740
heard of this so this is this is a

449
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,960
service that allows you to proxy through

450
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,950
residential home networks just like

451
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,990
yours and mine now this is great for

452
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,779
attackers and people who want to look

453
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,090
like they're coming from

454
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:49,239
an intial home networks but why would

455
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:51,968
you or I have something like this that

456
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:53,950
allows other arbitrary people to proxy

457
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:55,419
through our network this is important if

458
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,799
you take nothing away you should go

459
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:59,979
check your home networks especially if

460
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,559
you have spouses or kids or roommates or

461
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:04,389
anyone else in your house because this

462
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,379
happens because of services like this

463
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:09,758
olá VPN this is a free VPN doesn't even

464
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:13,840
encrypt traffic it's a pretty useless

465
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:15,369
VPN but it allows you to make it seem

466
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,978
like your traffic is coming from another

467
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:20,468
country now why would anyone willingly

468
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:22,659
install something like this for services

469
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:24,389
like Netflix and Amazon Prime and

470
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:26,499
streaming services things like that

471
00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:28,449
content rights in different parts of the

472
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:30,129
world are different so if I want to

473
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,039
watch Harry Potter I can't do that in

474
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:34,330
the US but I can do that in Australia so

475
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,649
if I get something like this and to make

476
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,509
it look like my traffic's coming from

477
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:40,149
Australia I can watch all of Harry

478
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:44,129
Potter all I want this is the type of

479
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:47,139
thing that runs rampant in in like

480
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:48,609
social groups one person gets in on this

481
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:50,320
starts recommending it to their friends

482
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:52,599
pretty soon everyone has hola VPN

483
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,599
installed and then when their phones or

484
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:57,489
PCs are idle of course it turns your

485
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,589
home network into a proxy for something

486
00:18:57,489 --> 00:19:01,809
like the loominatee Network this is why

487
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:04,239
these things are free again and I'm sure

488
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,799
we all notice in this room if you're not

489
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:08,200
paying for a service you're being

490
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:11,649
fleeced somehow and this is how this

491
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,469
service makes money so one of the

492
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:16,779
defenses that we took put in place and I

493
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:18,940
say we in general as the industry put in

494
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:20,739
place next was CAPTCHAs the squiggly

495
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,259
letters and numbers and lines through

496
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:25,330
them and stuff like that because basic

497
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:27,219
tools that were just issuing HB requests

498
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,408
couldn't figure out what to respond here

499
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:31,779
so then we already talked about this you

500
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:33,549
go through CAPTCHA solvers before it was

501
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,339
better and better optical character

502
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:38,168
recognition and then as CAPTCHAs got

503
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:39,940
more advanced then they started farming

504
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:42,669
it out to api's which then farmed it out

505
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,639
to actual individual human beings etc

506
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:48,249
etc etc then the the next defense was

507
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:51,339
dynamic sites and JavaScript heavy

508
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:53,109
defenses you get into reCAPTCHA v2 which

509
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:54,789
is certainly a great example of a

510
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,428
JavaScript heavy defense but there are

511
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:59,070
numerous out there

512
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:01,679
and to bypass these you don't

513
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:03,629
necessarily need to run JavaScript but

514
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,450
you do need something that understands

515
00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:08,610
the browser understands the Dom under

516
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,669
stare can can query for values that

517
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:14,008
exist in the JavaScript context or or in

518
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,779
in the Dom so yeah things like phantom

519
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:17,850
Jas and trifle jeaious which are

520
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:19,529
scriptable web views web views are just

521
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,389
in development containers that that

522
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:24,240
include browser components that you can

523
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:27,029
embed into other things these were early

524
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,009
instances of tools that allowed users to

525
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:31,259
test websites these are not attack tools

526
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:33,980
the generic purpose tools that attackers

527
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:36,570
use to continue attacking websites

528
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,580
defense we had against those was

529
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,749
inspecting the environment or looking at

530
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:46,559
the host header order so we notice here

531
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:48,899
the host header for Chrome is always the

532
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,759
first header that is sent in phantom

533
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:52,860
jeaious it is always the last header

534
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,240
that is sent so when you look for simple

535
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,549
things like this it starts just to

536
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,379
expose huge swathes of traffic that you

537
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:00,539
can block relatively easily of course

538
00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:02,309
something like this is easy to bypass

539
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:04,440
but this is what the game is back and

540
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:06,779
forth with with attackers you find

541
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,369
something you block on it they bypass it

542
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:10,590
you find something you block on it over

543
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:12,360
and over and over again phantom phantom

544
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,470
jeaious and other tools also expose

545
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,590
things in the JavaScript environment

546
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:18,899
phantom exposes the method call phantom

547
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,820
which you can use to talk back to the

548
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:22,469
phantom API you look for things like

549
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,759
that you pass it up to your server or

550
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,950
you do something on the web page and you

551
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,480
can block browsers that way again very

552
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,450
very simple techniques not very

553
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,629
complicated attacker has moved on and

554
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:35,279
started scripting consumer browsers so

555
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:38,009
you use things like selenium and now

556
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,509
puppeteer in order to script consumer

557
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:41,789
browsers modern stuff the stuff that

558
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:45,539
we're using production chrome production

559
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:47,129
Firefox edge anything else these are the

560
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:49,950
same sorts of things as phantom and

561
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:52,559
trifle but they are now scripting real

562
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:56,330
browsers in order to bypass the the

563
00:21:52,559 --> 00:22:00,600
oddities of using a non-standard browser

564
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:02,908
the next step there is to the defense

565
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,129
there sorry before I jump into into the

566
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:07,529
how to bypass that defense was browser

567
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:09,070
fingerprinting so this is something

568
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:11,440
that's still actually

569
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,178
prevalent today but it's you grab a

570
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,039
whole bunch of data from the browser

571
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:16,630
could be like screen size the plugins

572
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,980
you have installed the fonts you have

573
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,200
installed things like that

574
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,330
you grab enough high entropy data points

575
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,009
smash those together and you essentially

576
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,080
just rate limit on them same sort of

577
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,840
concepts as IP rate limiting but with

578
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,439
browser metadata as opposed to a network

579
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:34,330
level metadata and attackers of course

580
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,919
and do that this is just recycled add

581
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,230
technology that used to track you all

582
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,850
over the place so it was well known and

583
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,850
they would get to they would make tools

584
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:45,009
like this this is fraud fox which is the

585
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,110
ultimate in Internet privacy

586
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:48,789
all these tools talk about how their

587
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,729
privacy oriented but with a name like

588
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:53,169
fraud Fox you can probably figure out

589
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:57,970
what its what its intended to be used

590
00:22:53,169 --> 00:23:01,269
for but this in anti detect they they

591
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:03,399
make or they specialize in randomizing

592
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:05,259
and altering those fingerprint well data

593
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:06,850
points so if your rate-limiting off

594
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,889
those you're you're not going to be

595
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,379
caught in those rate limits anymore this

596
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:14,110
is also a virtual machine-based solution

597
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:16,719
for defeating browser fingerprinting so

598
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:18,309
because it's vm based once you get it

599
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,230
configured you can then deploy it to

600
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:22,090
whatever virtualization solution you are

601
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:26,320
interested in and you are perfectly

602
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:29,199
scalable to the sky next defense there

603
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,830
was then identifying negative traits

604
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,860
from user behavior it's very very easy

605
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:38,049
to identify a bot when they look like

606
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,508
this when they're just incredibly

607
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:42,070
quickly typing out letters or smashing

608
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:42,730
out entire strings in a fraction of a

609
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,220
millisecond

610
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,769
we're always clicking at the zero zero

611
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,629
XY point on elements things like that

612
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:52,720
make it very very easy to identify

613
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:54,250
obviously non human behavior and in a

614
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,379
situation like this what we're dealing

615
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,690
with the vast majority of non human

616
00:23:56,379 --> 00:24:01,059
behavior is going to be traffic that is

617
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,259
trying to manipulate and exploit you so

618
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:03,850
you look for those you pass them up to

619
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:06,009
your server do some sort of checks and

620
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:08,649
then you can detect or you detect and

621
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:10,899
block browsers that way and of course

622
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:12,489
attackers move on from there and use a

623
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:15,370
tool like I talked about before browser

624
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:17,679
automation studio can you see the cursor

625
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:21,479
there yeah so this is this is a tool

626
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:23,460
that emulates user behavior so it rather

627
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,150
than just teleporting the mouse over and

628
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:29,880
over again you will see the mouse

629
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:32,760
gradually go to - to the points you want

630
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,530
to click randomize the exact points have

631
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,410
some jitter along the way you'll even

632
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:40,260
notice before it would stop in random

633
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:42,210
places you can add a configurable idle

634
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,890
human behavior so you can simulate

635
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,270
things like like reaching for your

636
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,280
coffee and hitting the mouse a little

637
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:49,500
bit or walking away from your computer

638
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,540
for a little while this takes time which

639
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,950
does increase the cost of an attack but

640
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,168
if that's your way through then it's

641
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:58,590
still low enough costs in order to to

642
00:24:55,169 --> 00:25:01,710
offset that by the value so the defense

643
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:03,389
there was browser consistency checks see

644
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,970
this back and forth you catching

645
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:08,549
catching a rhythm so far this is what

646
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,740
we've been doing for years and these are

647
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:13,379
very very motivated persistent attackers

648
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,210
who are trying to get through so because

649
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,450
they're randomizing data points I

650
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,799
started to invest in the validation of

651
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,650
these data points to make sure they're

652
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:24,360
well within good ranges if you're chrome

653
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,790
you better be telling us that you

654
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,139
support OGG Vorbis if you're Internet

655
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,909
Explorer and you're telling us that you

656
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,740
support OGG Vorbis chances are you are

657
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,929
lying about that because you don't

658
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,090
support OGG Vorbis so these are the

659
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:37,890
types of things that you can look for in

660
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:40,439
order to determine how many lies the

661
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,870
attacker is telling you your real users

662
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,429
don't need to lie a lot attackers do

663
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,110
because they're using a handful of

664
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:48,480
sources and then distributing that

665
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:50,070
traffic so it looks like millions they

666
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,450
need to look like millions otherwise you

667
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:57,270
block them so they have to lie more next

668
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:59,520
step their attackers used real device

669
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:02,730
fingerprints so this is Babla softs

670
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:06,179
fingerprint switcher which which scrapes

671
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:08,490
and records and stores loads of real

672
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:09,570
user browser fingerprints now I'm using

673
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,580
fingerprints at this point because

674
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,290
they're using finger points fingerprints

675
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,030
at this at this point it's just a

676
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,770
collection of data that has grabbed from

677
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:19,260
browsers we've lost the fingerprint

678
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:21,210
ability really at this point but it's

679
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,270
still allowing you to with a browser

680
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,830
extension or or an attack tool iterate

681
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,600
through real browser fingerprints learn

682
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:30,449
to further obscure the source of your

683
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,219
traffic so we still have some more to go

684
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:33,929
but we're gonna bypass that a little bit

685
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,840
because I think you see probably where

686
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:37,150
the direction is

687
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,399
is heading all of this is heading

688
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:42,520
towards the emulation of real user

689
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:45,280
behavior on real devices on real home

690
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,680
networks so this is what we're calling

691
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,980
in our company because we need to

692
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,120
differentiate these imitation attacks

693
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,880
imitation attacks indicate a

694
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,040
sophisticated level of fraud advanced

695
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,660
developers and a level of persistence

696
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,450
that allows them to retool back and

697
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:04,090
forth trying to make their traffic look

698
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,130
as legitimate as possible

699
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:08,520
not all imitation attacks have to be

700
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,960
automated not all imitation attacks are

701
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,480
automation they say that right I think

702
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,010
you probably get the gist but in general

703
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,860
this is where we see things going is is

704
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:19,390
the perfect emulation of human behavior

705
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,850
and at that point it's gonna be very

706
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:25,870
very difficult for us to differentiate

707
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:29,040
legitimate traffic and attack traffic so

708
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:32,909
where do account takeovers go from here

709
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:36,460
now first I need to clear something up

710
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:38,560
to a factor authentication does not stop

711
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,630
credential stuffing this is something

712
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,520
that we hear touted a lot by Google

713
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,050
Microsoft as not that they're

714
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,060
necessarily saying this but they're

715
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,220
using words that allow people to assume

716
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,929
this is what they're saying multi-factor

717
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,020
authentication does a great job as

718
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:54,220
stopping automated account takeovers but

719
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,990
like we were talking about earlier

720
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:59,110
there's always a back and forth between

721
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:02,110
manual work and automation now it's not

722
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,699
necessary and necessary that when you're

723
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:05,500
automating credential stuffing you have

724
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,510
to automate the account takeover part

725
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,940
credential stuffing alone still gives

726
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:12,280
you valid accounts and the valid

727
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:15,490
accounts still have value now think

728
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,600
about the type of person who if they're

729
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,970
if they're victim to a credential

730
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,260
selling attack is reusing a password but

731
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,540
they also have multi-factor

732
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,340
authentication enabled that's the type

733
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,470
of person that knows enough to be

734
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,429
confident but not knows enough but

735
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,710
doesn't know enough to be effective

736
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:33,220
these are exactly the type of people

737
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:36,100
that are very easy to fish or social

738
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,420
engineer now it's a bypass multi-factor

739
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,040
authentication I'm going to go through a

740
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,710
step right now and dropping some really

741
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,990
really cool zero-days on you all I wish

742
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,390
that would actually be cool but as a way

743
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,040
to advance for what we need because

744
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,440
cheap and

745
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,149
easy is what works here so to bypass

746
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,980
multi-factor authentication the easiest

747
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,670
and cheapest way to do that is to just

748
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,930
have the target do it for you so for me

749
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,580
to do something like that I already have

750
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,860
username password I already know what

751
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,379
your username and password I enter those

752
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:08,010
in I get ready to submit and I give you

753
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:12,120
a call I give you a Gen Y on Jen

754
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:15,240
I give Jan a call here and I answers and

755
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,040
I say hey Jen I'm from what chase chases

756
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,310
the bank everyone knows I'm noticing

757
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,350
that you have some strange strange

758
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:24,540
purposes purchases from Australia are

759
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:27,389
you in Australia right now now of course

760
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:29,430
now you're an Amsterdam that's wild so

761
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:32,610
you did not just make an $8,000 purchase

762
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:34,080
and a $12,000 purchase no no of course

763
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:36,360
not and actually this is so this is I'm

764
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,159
kind of joking right now but questions

765
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,020
like this are good because they get the

766
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,610
person on the other end panicking they

767
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,050
get defensive and there's no of course

768
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:44,669
not I've didn't make those purchases at

769
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,379
all it's like okay okay alright alright

770
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,250
well normally in these situations I

771
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,050
would tell you to make sure that you

772
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:51,390
have multi-factor authentication turned

773
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:53,490
on it looks like you have that turned on

774
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:55,320
here which is good so I've told you that

775
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:59,460
I know something about your account that

776
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:03,750
really only the bank should know now can

777
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:05,550
I send you a can I send you a token or

778
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,710
to make sure that you have or that you

779
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,909
are actually in possession of the device

780
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,590
that has registered the account of

781
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,720
course and will take care of those

782
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:16,409
purchases immediately all I do is press

783
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,090
submit Jan gets a text message with a

784
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:20,490
multi-factor authentication token on

785
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,659
that gives it to me it says and then I

786
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,100
say it's like all right great we'll take

787
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,510
care of those purchases immediately will

788
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,699
write them from your record no worries

789
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:28,170
you enjoy your day and then you leave

790
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,570
the phone call thinking wow what great

791
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,310
customer service I did nothing and they

792
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,350
eliminated twenty thousand dollars worth

793
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:36,389
of purchases but what you've done is

794
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,830
just give an attacker the multi-factor

795
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:40,290
authentication token that gives them

796
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:43,050
access to your account this is what we

797
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:46,560
see because it's so easy and so cheap

798
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:48,540
now this is why it's important to to

799
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,090
talk about and think about the cost Reza

800
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:53,820
because once you have that list of valid

801
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:55,980
accounts the value of the attack from

802
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,570
that point on dramatically raises

803
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,730
because you don't have that wishy-washy

804
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:01,980
nosov the billions of in

805
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,870
user accounts so you can do different

806
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,040
things to get in there another thing

807
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:08,040
that we're seeing and if you were here

808
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,810
for the the cross site scripting talked

809
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:16,050
earlier then this is very relevant there

810
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:19,320
it's basically the the resident script

811
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:21,960
or extension hijacking account after the

812
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,409
user has gotten through an example says

813
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,450
guys logging into his bank logs in this

814
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:29,040
times taking it just a little bit longer

815
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:32,430
than normal but that's okay we've taught

816
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,620
web users that's perfectly okay this

817
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:36,420
time some sort of resident script or

818
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,520
extension or something like that has

819
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,800
hijacked a session so we're already

820
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:43,230
logged in and the script is making it

821
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,940
look like it's not logged in so go

822
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:47,850
through the script tries to add a new

823
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,680
page perfectly fine works because why

824
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,560
shouldn't it it's an API call already

825
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,080
authenticated no big deal then the

826
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:58,260
script tries to transfer funds now at

827
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,149
this point what could be a percentage or

828
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,700
a flat amount whatever is lower no big

829
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:05,970
deal at this point what most systems

830
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:08,550
should see is that this is this exceeds

831
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,660
a risk threshold this is shady we just

832
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,159
logged in at a new payee

833
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,530
tried to transfer right away that sets

834
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,820
off some alarms so we ask the user to

835
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:18,270
enter a multi-factor authentication

836
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:20,580
token pass that on to Barry who is

837
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,800
expecting this low it's no big deal they

838
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,050
enter in their token script grabs it

839
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,300
continues their transaction everything

840
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:30,270
looks ok and of course everything works

841
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:33,090
perfectly now this might seem how

842
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:34,590
Hollywood II and hypothetical but I mean

843
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,120
we already saw that talked earlier which

844
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,620
talked about how these scripts get

845
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,439
resident in your browser and stick

846
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,989
around this is no no different than that

847
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,870
we also see malicious extensions being

848
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:47,430
sold and acquired very very easily how

849
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,139
many of you paid for the extensions that

850
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,270
you have in your browser and I know it's

851
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,370
none of you so don't lie the developers

852
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,960
behind that aren't getting any money

853
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:56,280
necessarily if somebody wants to pay

854
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,630
them five to ten thousand dollars to

855
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,160
take that away a lot of them will

856
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,930
probably say yes and who knows what

857
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,510
happens those extensions afterward if

858
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,800
that's done enough as an attacker you

859
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,510
might as well just try to exploit a

860
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,520
developer machine and build your code

861
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,900
directly into the software that you want

862
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,080
to exploit it

863
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:15,170
is a NPM event stream exploit from last

864
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,399
November which had malicious code

865
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:19,860
injected to an open-source package and

866
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:23,460
then downloaded by 8 million developers

867
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:25,350
plus if anyone here uses node or NPM or

868
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,530
vs code or anything like that I

869
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:30,629
guarantee you that you had this code on

870
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,680
your computer it was just targeting and

871
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,690
specific things you don't necessarily

872
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,030
need to worry but if we all think we're

873
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:37,680
better than this or not this is

874
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:39,710
something that can easily just jump in

875
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:43,440
without us knowing

876
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:46,140
so after this what is beyond credential

877
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,020
stuffing now the value in these accounts

878
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,850
is not going away but we are raising the

879
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,760
cost of credential stuffing so it

880
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:56,129
becomes easier for attackers to justify

881
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,250
other a tool other tools to find these

882
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:02,760
valid accounts and to exploit them I see

883
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:06,120
a lot of diversity of attacks this is an

884
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,280
example of the more recent malware that

885
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,109
we've seen called Genesis I mean some

886
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,140
news articles on the Genesis marketplace

887
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:16,770
this is a marketplace malware and

888
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:19,339
extension combination what it does is it

889
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:21,690
infects computers and it has upwards of

890
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:25,560
125,000 right now already infected and

891
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:27,149
it scrapes accounts and cookies and

892
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,520
everything else that is happening on

893
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:32,069
that machine and sends it to this

894
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,080
marketplace you can see some of these

895
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,700
accounts these high-value accounts

896
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,649
already advertised things like LinkedIn

897
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,609
Google Facebook these are not just

898
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:40,969
trivial accounts they're just grabbing

899
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:44,130
them easily because they're in the

900
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:47,668
victims computer this particular account

901
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:50,130
fell victim September 17th which was

902
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:52,649
what a week and a half ago and it was

903
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:54,810
updated on the 18th I think I took these

904
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:56,580
screenshots on the 18th 19th or 20th so

905
00:34:54,810 --> 00:35:00,570
these are still very very very fresh and

906
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:04,080
the malware will continually grab these

907
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:06,660
accounts and update these records so

908
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,390
each infected computer and bundle of

909
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,370
information is sold as one unit once you

910
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,319
purchased it you are the only person who

911
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:16,049
has access to that bot and it's data

912
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:20,010
this allows the you to make sure that

913
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:22,140
you you you maintain the the quality of

914
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,800
this infected computer and the quality

915
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,029
of these printed credentials so that

916
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,660
don't have other people abusing it

917
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:30,460
having the victim become aware and clean

918
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:33,299
their computer you are in control of how

919
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:38,200
much you let on to the to the victim

920
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:40,570
this is the bot details page you can see

921
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,379
that it scrapes everything it possibly

922
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:45,670
can so it has 114 known resources so

923
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,320
these are common sites things that it

924
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:50,980
definitely knows Facebook Tumblr

925
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,600
Instagram stuff like that and 484 total

926
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,820
resources this might be other things

927
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,370
that look like usernames and passwords

928
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:59,260
session cookies stuff like that what you

929
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:01,390
can also do here is generate

930
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,710
fingerprints again I'm calm saying

931
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,240
fingerprint but now we're starting to

932
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,880
blur the line as to what a fingerprint

933
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,500
actually is what this is doing and I

934
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,720
can't show every step because there are

935
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,730
some details that I don't want anyone to

936
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,140
or anyone who owns the site to query in

937
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,990
order to find out whose account this is

938
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,490
because we still want this account but

939
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:21,160
you go through and you can select which

940
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:23,830
aspects of the environment on the

941
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,149
victims computer you want to emulate so

942
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,680
it can be the browser data can be the

943
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,300
operating system it can be qualities of

944
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,430
the operating system the storage space

945
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,260
things like that and then once you have

946
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,359
gathered all the information that you

947
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,740
want you can generate your fingerprint

948
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,320
the extension communicates with the

949
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,990
marketplace and now your browser has all

950
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,260
the data of that victims computer so

951
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:47,799
this will easily bypass a lot of risk

952
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,660
scores for modern authentication things

953
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,700
like where you log in from a new Wi-Fi

954
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,319
point or or device or something like

955
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,520
that you're like hey this is new can you

956
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,920
enter your multi-factor authentication

957
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,390
token something like that this is

958
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,370
designed to make you look like your

959
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:04,930
victim and of course as with a lot of

960
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:07,359
malicious software that is built and

961
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:10,690
generated by Russia it abides by the

962
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:15,570
don't screw your buddies policy so none

963
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:17,950
of the CIS countries are part of this

964
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:20,350
circle so if you're looking to exploit

965
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:22,899
any Russian accounts or services you're

966
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:25,420
out of luck unfortunately so what we're

967
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,610
seeing here in general is the trend

968
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:31,060
towards advanced malware that is

969
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:33,280
learning and emulating everything about

970
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:35,160
a host device so as we're talking about

971
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,980
earlier the trend is looking

972
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,410
for how do you emulate actual humans

973
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:43,650
what we're seeing and what we see with

974
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:45,000
the trends of malware is that a lot of

975
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,040
it starts with ad fraud because there's

976
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,890
just so much money and so much fraud

977
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,390
already and ad networks and then we see

978
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,850
moving on to crypto mining because

979
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:56,310
that's a that was an easier way to to

980
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:58,200
grab money or steal money and now it's

981
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:01,529
just general account takeovers boring

982
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,359
stuff now but irrelevant for me and this

983
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,430
is a great article that was written on

984
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,260
BuzzFeed I think a mid to late last year

985
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:10,200
which is a bunch of malicious

986
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:12,420
applications on mobile devices learning

987
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,430
how the applications and user were using

988
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,520
those devices in order to commit ad

989
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:19,379
fraud so the learning of individual user

990
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,970
behavior already has precedent and is

991
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,530
already falling in line with what we

992
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:25,049
would expect and then you combine that

993
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:26,970
with account takeovers malware that is

994
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,860
already resident on individuals machines

995
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,870
it becomes easier to see how you can

996
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,280
bypass even those super super cool

997
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,660
vendors that are talking about AI

998
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,700
behavior analysis that will identify

999
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,980
your user behavior in order to identify

1000
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,830
you it's like ah it's not that big of a

1001
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,630
deal so that is where we see things

1002
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:45,120
going and at that point it's gonna be

1003
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:48,930
extremely difficult to identify all of

1004
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:50,940
these individual malicious attackers so

1005
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:54,120
the one thing I can leave you with this

1006
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:57,480
is a fraud problem and fraud problems

1007
00:38:54,120 --> 00:39:00,630
are not technical problems we can't find

1008
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,580
a silver bullet solution against humans

1009
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:05,010
because if you are financially motivated

1010
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,080
and you can justify economically your

1011
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,370
actions and you have to put food on the

1012
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,830
table for your family and pay rent

1013
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:12,750
you're gonna figure out a way to attack

1014
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:15,270
the people you want to attack if that is

1015
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,410
your particular career choice so

1016
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,780
advanced credential stuffing and stuff

1017
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,609
like that is very sophisticated fraud

1018
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,200
it's not a bot problem or anything like

1019
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,700
that you can't just smack it down and

1020
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,049
walk away these are things that you're

1021
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,480
going to have to start building teams

1022
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,500
around you have to take back to your

1023
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,900
executives or managers your vice

1024
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,180
presidents and talk about the problem

1025
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,150
because it's going to involve a change

1026
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,259
in the way we organize as companies

1027
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:39,090
developers is gonna have to become

1028
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,830
closer to security and fraud teams you

1029
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,910
have to do a better at understanding

1030
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,980
each other so we can build features

1031
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:46,649
earlier in the pipeline to address

1032
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,470
problems because this is the tocker's

1033
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,480
iterate very very quickly I

1034
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,279
even if we're a super agile working in

1035
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,460
one or two weeks prints it's not fast

1036
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,740
enough to get things out so imitation

1037
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,770
attacks in general they're designed to

1038
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:02,868
blend in and unfortunately that makes it

1039
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:05,060
difficult for you to just walk over to

1040
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:06,890
your graphs or your ops teams or or

1041
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:10,369
whatever else and just see whether or

1042
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:11,629
not you have a bunch of fraud because

1043
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:13,640
they're designed to blend in they're

1044
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:15,290
designed to look like legitimate users

1045
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,160
so you're gonna have to look deeper and

1046
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:19,040
to figure out whether or not you

1047
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,020
actually do have a problem and in

1048
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,369
general at the end and every single

1049
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:25,580
defense you put in place is going to

1050
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:27,410
fail that is something that we just have

1051
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,180
to understand I work for a company who

1052
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:31,368
specifically like tries to build stuff

1053
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:34,430
to defend against this our defenses fail

1054
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:36,200
all the time it's how you adapt to that

1055
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:37,879
failure that is important and that is

1056
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,500
something that our team security teams

1057
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,880
and development teams need to adopt

1058
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:44,390
because that is a different level of

1059
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,820
iteration and agility thank you that is

1060
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:48,740
my talk I'm Jared Overson you can find
