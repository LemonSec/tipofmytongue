1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,590
you

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:09,149
hi everyone thanks for showing up to my

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:12,240
talk titled how to learn in T checking

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,770
it's not a technical talk it's the end

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:20,509
of the conference maybe you're already

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:25,230
tired well it's not gonna be too complex

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:27,119
so the talk is it's best three segments

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,010
first of all I'm gonna explain what

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,940
hacking actually means then we're gonna

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:39,090
talk about how one might learn it and

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:41,489
then how to teach it but first first

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:46,110
things first if you can hear me say

13
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,610
something orient I really don't like

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,120
this room because you always have first

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,960
row feeling but okay I'm gonna step

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:59,459
closer to here as a researcher I'm also

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,050
trying to do my PhD and I love sitting

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,600
so tomorrow I'm gonna explain in a

19
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,509
little bit and I'm a trainer at IT

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,330
sector rocks must accommodate it thus

21
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,920
true information security trainees from

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,109
a defense perspective

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,960
well if you since picture first oh well

24
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:19,880
first of all I want to say that the

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,990
organizers cropped this picture because

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,289
you might be wondering what the hell I'm

27
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:30,408
doing I mean I am German after all but

28
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:33,649
of course I'm holding up a zucchini as a

29
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:35,349
cyber city it's our team's mascot and

30
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:40,609
what team am I talking about

31
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:43,629
well Constantine the guy with the beard

32
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:46,939
and me we found that at our university

33
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:49,189
club a club breaking stuff going on at

34
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:52,878
the park we were missing enough

35
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:54,798
practical exercises at our University so

36
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:59,629
we started competing in online hacking

37
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,369
competitions and we invested a lot of

38
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:05,659
time in them really really really liked

39
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:08,299
them out in grew over time so we went to

40
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:10,489
DEFCON CTF which is the DEF CON acting

41
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:12,079
competition here's a people look tired

42
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:16,280
because those competitions

43
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:17,180
finals usually last 24 hours so you

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,250
don't sleep for a while

45
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:24,440
and or tomorrow and at our university we

46
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,290
now have a lot of people that are

47
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:37,489
interested in information security and

48
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:39,319
hacking the nice gentleman okay so what

49
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:43,669
do we do in this club were just meet

50
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:45,290
once a week we act together we started

51
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:47,950
at these competitions but reals like

52
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:51,950
real stuff and nearby mall for example

53
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:56,798
and more interestingly and that's why I

54
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:59,358
having this long introduction is reteach

55
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:02,450
one professor of our University actually

56
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:04,669
stumbled across write-ups we published

57
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:08,119
write-ups on our block about interesting

58
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:09,139
stuff we did is it that's actually quite

59
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,480
interested in what you're doing why

60
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:14,989
don't you teach a course at university

61
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,638
for course 6-8 CTS credits it's really

62
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,230
uncommon because we were sole students

63
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,830
at that University

64
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:24,140
but that actually forced us to think

65
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:27,610
about what we're doing well we had to

66
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:33,829
think about what hacking actually is and

67
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:35,750
if you can't even teach it so I don't

68
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:40,430
really know what this presentation is

69
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,750
gonna be about okay so of course you

70
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,330
will look up the stuff on Wikipedia

71
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,010
first with uzuki PDSA a computer is a

72
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,900
skilled computer expert that uses

73
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:51,709
technical knowledge to overcome a

74
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:54,140
problem but synonymously nowadays where

75
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,810
they occur usually minha security hacker

76
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:00,950
that somebody who uses bugs are exploits

77
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:04,010
to break into a system as well see these

78
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:05,570
two are equivalent a security eckhart

79
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,480
does the exact same thing it's also just

80
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,220
a skilled computer expert that tries to

81
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,700
overcome a problem just a problem looks

82
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,230
different so when I say hacker in this

83
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:21,469
talk I'm always talking about security

84
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:23,960
hacker okay now first lesson at the

85
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:28,850
university there's a weird course called

86
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:31,070
hacking I don't my sensor makes an

87
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:36,280
application dance it sounds really

88
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:39,050
stupid but it kind of captures the idea

89
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,609
if we look at this goal it's in the

90
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,940
beginning of the lecture we always said

91
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:48,950
very small code snippets that they had

92
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:51,050
to break boiled down code so this code

93
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,270
if you would find in a bigger real

94
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,940
application you'd say okay the

95
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,030
programmer intended to get some user

96
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:02,870
input called BW hash this user input

97
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:07,489
using md5 and then compared to her ash X

98
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:11,479
value of hash but that's not at all what

99
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:13,420
this code does if you're familiar with

100
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:17,400
the topic maybe you'll see

101
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:20,650
this string starts with a zero e so PHP

102
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,120
thinks this is okay looks like a number

103
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,330
looks like a floating point number a

104
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,680
zero with an exponent so it just

105
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,450
implicitly casts it to zero so

106
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,330
essentially in order to hit to reach

107
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:38,170
this code path and to receive the flag

108
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:42,969
we just need to find the hash value that

109
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:44,500
- starts with zero E and what PHP does

110
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:48,040
it compares zero to zero which is of

111
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,470
course true what does that have to do

112
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,950
with dancing well the program are never

113
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:57,070
intended this the program are never

114
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:59,260
implemented purposely a comparison of

115
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:03,670
two integers and that's what the hacker

116
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:05,770
does that always uses the difference

117
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:09,310
between what the programmer thinks he

118
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:14,799
does and what he actually does another

119
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:17,920
example this is a Python code from a

120
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,610
real web application is a function that

121
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:26,410
takes a SVG file is a vector graphic and

122
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:32,290
converts it to a rendered PNG file sorry

123
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:35,110
if I screw up the microphone so I don't

124
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:39,630
know if anybody sees the bug here and

125
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:42,100
the code there is no back in the code

126
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,480
well this buck in the code but it's not

127
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,720
in the code because it's in a

128
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,640
third-party library well know how

129
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,640
application development works nowadays I

130
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,229
do a pip install you will get clone of a

131
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,820
library that I like and that I'm gonna

132
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,960
use it

133
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,370
abstraction is good from that point of

134
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,469
perspective from security perspective

135
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:04,480
it's really bad this library internally

136
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,360
because vector graphics are defined in

137
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,810
XML structure

138
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,860
users Hellickson Elizabethton package

139
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:17,490
which is a wrapper for lip xml but per

140
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:21,349
default Alex ml enables external

141
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:26,060
entities so with this code you can

142
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:29,819
extract all files from the server again

143
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,919
you're doing something that application

144
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:36,229
developer never intended you want a

145
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,229
program to transform an SVG to a PNG

146
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:44,639
yeah so the problem is but he uses a

147
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:47,240
library that uses a library it uses a

148
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,979
library that has bad default value for

149
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,699
allowing external entities femtocell in

150
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:57,628
it goes like sexy but more scientific in

151
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:59,759
it's my last example this binary

152
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:03,840
exploitation this is a assembly

153
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,879
instructions and they jump there is a

154
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,080
comparison if it's false it jumps here

155
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:13,219
if it's true it jumps here and what you

156
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,889
as echo do is you include another edge

157
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:20,009
you jump somewhere you alter the state

158
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:23,159
in a way that the programmer never

159
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:32,080
intended that is not obviously in the

160
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:37,929
program so what

161
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:39,670
the Packer neat well is it we're good a

162
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,500
basic understanding of computer science

163
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:45,640
or if you wants to specialize in

164
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:49,450
something like WEP then he needs to be

165
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,100
good in that but on some level it's all

166
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,580
related so a general understanding of

167
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,650
computer sciences very good I think in

168
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,700
its knife for directors after a while

169
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:02,370
you kind of get an idea where usually

170
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,910
bugs exists and where bugs exist

171
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,060
vulnerabilities exist

172
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:09,100
you need creativity very important and a

173
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,410
very high threshold for frustration

174
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,330
because very often you will look at code

175
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:16,150
for hours or days and then might not

176
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:19,030
find anything from a teacher's

177
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:22,180
perspective the first or you can teach

178
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:24,550
somewhat last row is up to the

179
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,829
individual person because can't teach

180
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:32,229
somebody to be creative that's something

181
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:34,330
the that's something the person has to

182
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,300
come up with themselves exactly with the

183
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:39,550
frustration threshold so it shouldn't

184
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,689
waste time on the last two parts because

185
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:46,920
you can't do anything about it this

186
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:51,930
teacher okay now all to learn it well

187
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:57,939
you learn it pretty much the same as

188
00:09:51,930 --> 00:10:00,670
most other difficult topics read a lot

189
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,280
really good write-ups about security

190
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:08,260
vulnerability exploits papers books and

191
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:09,640
advisories gonna make a statment

192
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,480
statement that's not gonna make me

193
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,460
popular probably but I really don't like

194
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,160
most of the information security books

195
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,270
like I think most security books

196
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,469
actually really suck and what I

197
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,750
encourage you to do is get a normal

198
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,840
computer science book maybe about

199
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:32,980
foundations example modern operating

200
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:36,310
systems by Tannenbaum and learn about

201
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,910
our file system works and once you

202
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,589
understood exactly how it works

203
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,990
don't things like a developer how could

204
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:48,780
I make better than like a hacker how

205
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:50,490
could I break it yeah so for reading

206
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,260
books I recommend reading normal

207
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,540
computer science books not security

208
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:58,470
books there are talks for example at

209
00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:01,980
media dot CCC DoDEA's media platform

210
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:04,470
from the Chaos Computer Club sometimes

211
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,180
you find Def Con talks online and for

212
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:10,470
practice which is really important

213
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:12,079
because you need to get your hands dirty

214
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,200
otherwise you're not gonna become

215
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:24,270
successful is my very big recommendation

216
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:30,030
play CD f's okay who knows what a CTF is

217
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:33,870
oh well this one half of the one that's

218
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:35,540
nice so I'm gonna go over it briefly

219
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,460
because I don't want to lose it anyone

220
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,380
since yeah is a very simple game these

221
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,600
kids are playing it there are multiple

222
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,040
teams if you steal the flag from a team

223
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,700
you get a point if somebody sees your

224
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,160
flag it was a point here my teammate

225
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:53,040
culture who is playing the exact same

226
00:11:50,160 --> 00:12:01,680
game just the hacker variant it's an

227
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:04,140
attack defense EDF at DEFCON so how does

228
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,170
the city of work well in the beginning

229
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,170
there's a service usually where the

230
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:12,150
hospital let's assume it's a web service

231
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:17,400
it can also be a encrypted file to

232
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:20,010
download or TCP port whatever and with

233
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,829
it within this service oh there's my

234
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:28,830
mouse has it been there's whole thing

235
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:31,350
I'm sorry within this service there's a

236
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:33,630
flag buried most likely in the file

237
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,360
system of the server but it can also be

238
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:38,270
somewhere inside that service on the

239
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,459
admin page or something

240
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:46,069
and your goal as participant is to hack

241
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:48,829
the service for someone get remote code

242
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,720
execution on the server and then extract

243
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,459
this flag once you have this plaque you

244
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,920
submit it to the organizers and you get

245
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:58,430
points for it in an attack different

246
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:01,099
city if other people host this services

247
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:06,050
and in the Jeopardy one it's all simple

248
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:08,750
centrally by the organizers surely there

249
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,089
is a prepared vulnerability and that

250
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,010
service and you need to find it very

251
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:14,660
often there are more vulnerabilities in

252
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,270
those services so there are multiple

253
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,730
possible solution and now it's even a

254
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:23,360
trend because these competitions have

255
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:26,089
come really far to have a zero-day

256
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:31,970
category with the actual services with

257
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:33,709
not prepared weaknesses um yeah it's

258
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,140
pretty great as these things are getting

259
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:40,599
more and more difficult but also prize

260
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:44,390
money SF risen to an insane level okay I

261
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:48,470
was a bit abstract with an example of a

262
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:50,510
CTF task from three weeks ago or so from

263
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:55,160
the Tokyo Western CTF let's at the CDF

264
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:57,709
team from Japan it was a PHP service

265
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,620
called PHP note and also a note

266
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:03,109
sorcerer's you could just create an

267
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,870
account create notes and save them

268
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:08,180
access them later and you were given the

269
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,700
source code I was caught off his leader

270
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,390
quite obvious that the goal was to

271
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:17,170
access the notes of the admin account

272
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,170
because there would be the flag

273
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:22,899
we popped in Azeris we spent a lot of

274
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:27,849
time on it they invested like 12 hours I

275
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:31,000
think in the challenge and the code base

276
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:33,190
was pretty big but at some point you

277
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,980
find out okay the cocaine is delivered

278
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,300
as a flag if you're admin or not but you

279
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,600
can't just change the cookie because the

280
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:44,010
cookies MACT and in order to create your

281
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,540
own Mac you need to get this secret

282
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:49,620
which is a global secret but it's stored

283
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:56,829
server-side and it's stored in your

284
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:59,050
session so how do we access the secret

285
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:01,540
which is just in the session we can't

286
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,550
from client-side access it and we looked

287
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:10,480
at this source code for as I said very

288
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:17,139
very long how did I solve it in the end

289
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:20,230
I didn't it these things are pretty

290
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:25,029
difficult and I didn't manage we found

291
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:28,449
some ways to fiddle with the server but

292
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:30,819
we didn't manage to extract the secret

293
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:32,380
so first lesson insidious these things

294
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:37,300
are the girls are really hard

295
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:39,399
and you will probably fail a lot but

296
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,680
afterwards I read a write-up but from a

297
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,120
team that soft it and the actual

298
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,000
solution I want to present because it

299
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,630
shows why in my opinion CTS are really

300
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,300
good way to learn hacking well the

301
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:55,199
server was running on Windows we saw

302
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,790
that it was an IAS or trying some stuff

303
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:04,529
it was the latest Windows version latest

304
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:06,760
iOS version latest PHP version we didn't

305
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:08,110
think it was important so we didn't

306
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,209
investigate further because we didn't

307
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:13,600
find anything while poking were staring

308
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:16,180
at the PHP code what we didn't know is

309
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,400
the session files in PHP are sorted out

310
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:21,520
right

311
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,959
usually this file is called session on

312
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,980
the line and then your PHP session ID

313
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,460
that you also see in the cookie

314
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,870
sometimes or in the URL and what we

315
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,270
didn't know what what makes sense is

316
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,180
Windows Defender was installed on this

317
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:36,819
web server that was running Windows and

318
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,280
what I personally didn't know Windows

319
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,610
Defender just blindly executed

320
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:45,670
everything it just doesn't matter if it

321
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,740
finds an erm binary x86 JavaScript does

322
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,560
matter it executes it there's what's to

323
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,750
find out if it's malicious it runs this

324
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,599
in a sandbox

325
00:16:51,750 --> 00:17:00,310
to be safe unless you can escape the

326
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,690
sandbox but that's another topic so how

327
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,540
can you solve this judge how can you

328
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:09,280
access a secret that's stored on the

329
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:10,899
server in this session file well Windows

330
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,240
Defender is pretty strict if it finds a

331
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:18,370
malicious call what it just deletes it

332
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,810
when it's gone so if we manage to inject

333
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,729
malicious code in our session the

334
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:32,470
sessions all will be deleted so a

335
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:34,180
session will be that we can't log in we

336
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,650
can inject malicious code because our

337
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,750
username is also stored in the session

338
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:42,640
which makes sense and we can register

339
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:43,870
and can choose our own username so as

340
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,720
that this is a write-up from another

341
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:51,729
team called salsicc it's another good

342
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,700
German team from New Zealand and what

343
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,050
they did is really clever

344
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:01,720
they created a username that's

345
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:03,790
JavaScript code that's the that's gonna

346
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,170
be written to the session file and it's

347
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,270
gonna be written in the beginning of the

348
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:09,670
session file and the secret is stored

349
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:12,460
afterwards so this is JavaScript and

350
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,840
here they open a body tag so everything

351
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:19,300
that comes afterwards in the session

352
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:21,049
file is considered the body what do they

353
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:25,070
do then well

354
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:29,600
create a string new coin then they check

355
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:31,820
what's the next character what's the

356
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,230
first character of the body so what

357
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:40,369
comes next in a session file and if this

358
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:41,869
first character matches thee what the

359
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:45,230
character age here and then the string

360
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:49,939
that's evaluated called Mel will say new

361
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:51,619
coin hive but user and what happens is

362
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,369
Windows Defender just deletes the

363
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:58,189
session file because it says ok they're

364
00:18:55,369 --> 00:19:02,539
trying to mine coins on this machine

365
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,799
this is evil from delete the file that's

366
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:09,919
quite clever because we built ourselves

367
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:12,408
an Oracle every time if and only if this

368
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,440
character matches the next character in

369
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:20,259
the session file Windows Defender will

370
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:23,749
delete the session and we can't login so

371
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:25,159
myocyte general we're able to extract

372
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:32,539
the full session file on there for the

373
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:34,730
secret and make it ourselves and why did

374
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:37,279
I like the session challenge even though

375
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,049
I didn't solve it well as with every

376
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,480
good CTF challenge and there are a lot

377
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:43,220
people invest a lot of time in this and

378
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,299
creating these challenges yet to think

379
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:49,309
outside the box we were so sure that the

380
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:51,769
park is somewhere in a PHP code who are

381
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:53,600
taking in it all along and we ignored

382
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:57,679
the surrounding environment which you

383
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,109
should never do and in the end it was

384
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,409
not so difficult but you need to think

385
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:09,619
outside the box and also take the

386
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:12,590
environment into consideration so was

387
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:15,000
that time wasted most 12 hours spent on

388
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,189
this challenge

389
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,260
you have to decide I say definitely not

390
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:21,390
not a minute because during those 12

391
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,580
hours we were learning super much about

392
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,820
PHP internals because we were looking

393
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,678
for books everywhere were looking at the

394
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:32,070
latest exploits for IAS we were seeing

395
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:34,169
where IAS might have problems because is

396
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:38,280
is also prone to site channel stuff and

397
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:40,950
I learnt super much in those 12 hours in

398
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,418
the end I didn't solve it it was bad

399
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:47,210
because we didn't qualify for the finals

400
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:51,289
but it was still well well invested time

401
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:57,120
so if you want to learn how to hack

402
00:20:51,289 --> 00:21:03,658
security acting what I suggest is really

403
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:06,330
read a lot and played of CTF um yeah the

404
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:08,520
usual workflow is you solve a challenge

405
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,740
that gives you points you move up in the

406
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:14,100
scoreboard you really pop them are

407
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:17,909
invited for finals trip paid and yeah

408
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,678
everything but and then you write a

409
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,240
write-up so other people can read what

410
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,890
you did because there are always

411
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,950
different kinds of solutions there's no

412
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,679
never one correct solution which is nice

413
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:34,490
and then you repeat that step every

414
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:37,049
weekend or as much as you want but yeah

415
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,360
one thing I mentioned is that in the

416
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:41,280
beginning is not going to look like that

417
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:44,399
that's with every new CTF team in the

418
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,830
beginning is gonna look like that you're

419
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,820
not gonna solve anything probably gonna

420
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:53,908
stare at code for 24 hours and maybe get

421
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:57,770
some points but not a lot you're gonna

422
00:21:53,909 --> 00:22:01,890
be really really down the scoreboard and

423
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:05,370
lose the CDF but afterwards definitely

424
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:08,220
go and read write-ups this combination

425
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:11,780
spend a lot of time investigating stuff

426
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:15,900
yourself and then wait up to date right

427
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:20,260
write-ups from other people is extremely

428
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:25,450
extremely effective in learning

429
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:29,470
okay so here's the first step program to

430
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:33,730
learn how to hack first very important

431
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:37,000
finally code making alone is really not

432
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,679
fun at least in my opinion when you're

433
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,940
working on a CTF you're usually working

434
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:41,830
individually but you're in the same room

435
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,660
you can talk to other people about what

436
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,820
you're working on they bring in their

437
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,309
ideas is very helpful especially if

438
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:52,080
you're playing competitively my what

439
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:54,100
encourage you to find real-life people

440
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,949
there are also teams that just read

441
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,340
online if you want one of those teams

442
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,470
are called

443
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,928
open to all for example or security SEC

444
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,370
and they're just yeah literally open to

445
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:07,059
all you can just join their slack and

446
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:08,860
then work with people online for me is a

447
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:11,950
lot more helpful with real people around

448
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:14,740
so maybe find a hackerspace nearby and

449
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:19,169
see if there's EDF team if not found one

450
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:22,350
and then do those steps and repeat over

451
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:22,350
and over

452
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,928
yep

453
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,150
if you want to get started with the CTS

454
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:34,270
there's a platform called CDF climbs up

455
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:37,210
orc which lists all the city apps as I

456
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:39,668
said this community used to be are

457
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:41,200
pretty small for mainly University

458
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:44,950
students challenging each other

459
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,500
now there's in the CDF season which is

460
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:49,150
in the winter probably two cities each

461
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,190
weekend you can even choose which one

462
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,600
you want to play there are lot of

463
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:56,080
beginner friendly ones but there are

464
00:23:52,600 --> 00:24:01,600
also very very difficult ones and my

465
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:04,899
into rating CTF time is a rating for the

466
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,000
CTS and that's important because that

467
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,630
means in previous times in previous

468
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,590
years the CDF's have proven to be good

469
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,929
so there's a high chance that their

470
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:16,600
story if they're not don't have a rating

471
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:19,929
yet it's also possible that somebody

472
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,639
else's sim who is not good and yeah you

473
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:26,169
shouldn't invest your time that's it yes

474
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,700
it's boring so place it yes with the

475
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:30,430
high rating

476
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,170
there's also team rating right now we're

477
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:34,660
not in the top 10 anymore but we're on

478
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,300
one in Germany and our goal is to be in

479
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,770
the top 10 again at the end of the year

480
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,840
yeah so if you want to play competitive

481
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:45,100
there's a really big imporant if you see

482
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:47,110
other teams and you want to participate

483
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,540
another thing probably everybody says

484
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:52,510
that about this community but for me the

485
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:55,060
CTF community is awesome I have only met

486
00:24:52,510 --> 00:25:00,280
really really great people at finals are

487
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:03,940
also at Congress and it's really really

488
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,290
awesome community in my opinion and

489
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:11,290
everybody's welcome also if you're a

490
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:15,730
beginner or pro doesn't matter oh yeah

491
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:19,120
okay so essentially for learning read a

492
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:21,790
lot play see this is my advice mono

493
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,340
teaching because I was motivated to

494
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:27,399
start because we had this course about

495
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:30,449
hacking and we had to think about it a

496
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,740
lot and I would encourage you to maybe

497
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,990
if you have the time and you're willing

498
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,560
to start a course on your own maybe in

499
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:41,790
your anchor space right here excuse me

500
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:49,330
in your university or whatever it work

501
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:51,760
but you should keep a few principles in

502
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:54,310
mind because the CTF sphere is pretty

503
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,560
popular of companies are hosting CDF's

504
00:25:54,310 --> 00:26:02,530
now I could sit here for example is the

505
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:07,090
Google CTF also relatively large prize

506
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:08,410
money but if you want to run for prize

507
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,939
money is probably better to do

508
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:13,210
background isn't that kind of stuff I

509
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:18,400
would say place it is for fun not for

510
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:20,410
for money facebook also CTF now but

511
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,210
there are also a lot of smaller

512
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:25,330
companies that also want to host CTS and

513
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,770
sometimes they do really wrong or some

514
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,470
people even want to use ETFs for

515
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:32,770
training internally and they're not

516
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:35,020
doing it correctly and then nobody

517
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:37,120
profits from it so I'm gonna give you a

518
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:40,000
little bit of advice what we learned and

519
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,080
what we did and what the students really

520
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,830
really liked

521
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:48,189
um the magic word is problem-based

522
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,908
learning so what is problem-based

523
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:54,190
learning

524
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:56,919
well PBL's very simple yeah basically is

525
00:26:54,190 --> 00:27:00,009
that the starting point for learning is

526
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:03,779
a puzzle that the bird has been once to

527
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:06,369
solve doesn't have to solve but once -

528
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:08,980
it has to be combined with a traditional

529
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:11,949
lecture so you have to teach them stuff

530
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:14,769
first and then use PBL PBL alone

531
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:17,580
research has shown is not effective if

532
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:19,779
you combine it

533
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:24,820
what is PBL used for interestingly

534
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:30,009
mostly in medicine curricula and it's

535
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:33,580
very good for turning theoretical

536
00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:35,320
knowledge into applicable skills so the

537
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,970
problem with medicine students was they

538
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,980
were learning a lot of stuff at

539
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:41,769
university at the door and a lot a lot

540
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:44,109
of stuff by heart then they entered I

541
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:45,970
don't know started in hospital and they

542
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:49,480
couldn't do much because they never

543
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:51,639
learned to approach a problem all by

544
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,999
themselves and that's what you tackle

545
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:59,799
with PBL you throw students into the

546
00:27:54,999 --> 00:28:02,049
cold water and they learn how to each

547
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:05,830
themself things and how to use their

548
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:08,139
fragment and knowledge how to combine it

549
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:11,039
how to connect the dots and then solve

550
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:11,039
complex problems

551
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:18,420
there are four words to ppl that you

552
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:20,639
should stick to first of all the problem

553
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,490
that you're serving your students has to

554
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,970
be authentic I'll say more about that in

555
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,450
a bit

556
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:31,440
then the sins short word in small groups

557
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:33,540
you know tutoring not teaching during a

558
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,770
PBL phase that means you don't help your

559
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:39,450
students at all which is difficult

560
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,270
because sometimes you want to help them

561
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:44,340
but if you help them you're actually not

562
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:46,440
helping them because you ruin the

563
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,300
element of I have to deal with it by

564
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,610
myself which is the most important

565
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:54,419
element I have to come up with the

566
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:57,629
solution and first I have to find a

567
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:59,880
problem yeah in with the medicine

568
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,770
students if you start in the hospital

569
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,710
nobody's gonna tell you okay

570
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:07,250
this man has this illness and you need

571
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,690
just prescribe him this medicine

572
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,710
firstest

573
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,690
medical staff has to find out what the

574
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,820
problem is and then they have to find a

575
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:18,360
solution so don't help his students

576
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,970
during the PBL face and the dividual

577
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,100
knowledge gained just means that

578
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:26,910
individual students go on Google go on

579
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:30,719
internet get it book whatever and start

580
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:32,880
learning by themselves the practical

581
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,340
thing is the last three things really

582
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,160
come in naturally in a CDF if you use

583
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:40,889
CDF's in your lecture you don't have to

584
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,770
worry about those but a first problem

585
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:45,480
authentic the press the point authentic

586
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,760
problem doesn't come natural actually

587
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,740
quite hard to write authentic problems

588
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,970
because we're a kur North End big

589
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:56,860
problem is a real software system that

590
00:29:53,970 --> 00:30:02,350
you have to develop so we can a kit

591
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:06,570
that's work but in general if you have

592
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,570
authentic problems realistic problems

593
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:16,690
DDS are really a perfect way to teach

594
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:20,020
aching so I said a lot of people want to

595
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:24,549
use idiots for teaching but then don't

596
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:26,679
really stick to ppl and PBL is what

597
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:30,450
makes CDF such an effective learning

598
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:34,390
tool in my opinion so what do a void

599
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:39,240
explainatory Texas very important as I

600
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:39,240
said if you explain too soon the problem

601
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:44,500
the problem here in this application is

602
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:50,380
it has an SQL injection in the file info

603
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:52,630
to PHP exploited the students not gonna

604
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,549
have to come up with what the problem is

605
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:56,799
itself and the large part of hacking is

606
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:59,500
finding the vulnerability but only using

607
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:02,470
it so there should be absolutely no

608
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:04,240
explanatory text as a ppl basic rule

609
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:08,110
there should be no context you're just

610
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,470
thrown into the problem there shouldn't

611
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:16,080
be a mandatory correct solution you see

612
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:21,880
us especially in educational suggests

613
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:24,280
that with this or to exploit this as

614
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:28,480
described here that's bad

615
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:29,410
because in that second the student

616
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,640
doesn't have to feeling he does

617
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:34,480
something he doesn't have to feel like

618
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,030
he's working realistically and then he's

619
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,600
not motivated anymore and then his brain

620
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,250
fear is that you know don't help the

621
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,469
students to the people doing the PBL

622
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,549
face during the lecture phase of course

623
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,740
if somebody has a question you answer

624
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:49,410
your question but during PBL they're on

625
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:53,160
their own

626
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:56,010
and avoid guessing challenges if there's

627
00:31:53,160 --> 00:32:02,610
a part in your challenge which has to be

628
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:05,160
guessed then it's a bad challenge okay

629
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:09,889
it's made a bit more practical here two

630
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:13,320
examples for tasks both from

631
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:17,220
cryptography perspective so I had an

632
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:19,590
arrow say encrypted secret that you want

633
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:24,120
the secret that's the point here the

634
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:26,760
modulus and two exponents that lead to

635
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,580
the same ciphertext and then this was a

636
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,990
nitrile task that's why I presented

637
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:34,490
recovered a plaintext using the

638
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:37,380
algebraic property blah blah blah and

639
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:39,510
that's really bad because first of all

640
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,060
this is not realistic because look at

641
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,700
the modulus it's thrown out bytes I can

642
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:48,690
work for seven seconds not even a second

643
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,130
so the obvious solution here is to just

644
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:53,730
brute force the modulus and after

645
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:55,590
plaintext when I'm done but this

646
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:58,850
explanatory text doesn't allow that it

647
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:01,139
says you have to use a specific property

648
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:03,629
in that second the student phases out

649
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,230
because his brain says ok this is not

650
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,030
relevant

651
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,830
I will tackle this problem completely

652
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,180
differently I would have a much nicer

653
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:14,419
solution but I'm not allowed to use it

654
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:21,720
and it's frustrating and doesn't help

655
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:23,850
another problem from our lecture this is

656
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,370
a c'mere science lecture so overall was

657
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,169
always just code because our students

658
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,360
you really think it sounds stupid but

659
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:33,600
they think in code they like code better

660
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:36,449
than mathematical formulas or or written

661
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,120
text so here's the code five encoded in

662
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:44,820
clothes by crypto but you can install it

663
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:47,610
with bit by crypto public key RC then it

664
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:50,820
reads the flag from the file generates

665
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:53,100
an RSA key with 2048 bits modulus that's

666
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,560
a common sizes with most people use

667
00:33:53,100 --> 00:34:01,230
nowadays it's a common practice

668
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:03,179
an exponent which is also right then in

669
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,310
the Crips the black and the Sermon just

670
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:07,740
gets the encrypted flag and a modulus

671
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:11,940
these are both public values in an

672
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,560
cryptographic system and now the student

673
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:18,990
has recovered a flag at the plaintext

674
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:22,409
and this is an actual Latin library

675
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:23,459
there's nothing tampered with it yeah so

676
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:25,320
the student has to figure out how to

677
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:29,970
break it which is actually quite easy in

678
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:32,700
this case if you're interested how to

679
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:37,259
decrypt this you can just try solving

680
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:40,830
the challenge or ask me later if you're

681
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:43,830
really interested um but I would of

682
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,668
course strongly encouraged to doesn't

683
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:52,319
mean I have ten more minutes

684
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:53,520
oh okay then I'm actually early so we

685
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:59,460
have a lot of time for questions I don't

686
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:02,910
know if that's good or bad for me yeah

687
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,410
so if you're dealing with nerds if

688
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:07,350
you're dealing with computer science

689
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:09,480
people I would always say just give them

690
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:11,640
a coats no matter if them actual coat

691
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,700
give them an application and then they

692
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,859
have to figure it out and the don't

693
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:20,149
write an explanatory text what this code

694
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:22,740
does because a lot of people okay

695
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:25,110
they have read our say before but they

696
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,240
don't know what it does exactly you

697
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,470
shouldn't tell them in this I mean if

698
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,080
you do it in the lecture part it's fine

699
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:33,209
but turn the ppl face all they have to

700
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,860
go to the capilla the committee has a

701
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:38,940
very good article about what are Zetas

702
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:42,090
it has links to a paper by Pony which

703
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:45,570
states common security falls in the RC

704
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:47,010
system why they have to learn to find

705
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,880
that kind of stuff read that kind of

706
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:58,450
stuff understand that kind of stuff

707
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:59,769
um yeah so I rushed forward a bit

708
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:03,788
because I have a lot I had a lot of

709
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:12,758
slides but now we have actually done

710
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:14,559
progressions last slide um tips for

711
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:16,269
teaching hacking in your local

712
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:20,680
hackerspace or at university or whatever

713
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:23,169
but laners a lot of companies a lot of

714
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:27,269
universities that are looking for people

715
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:29,710
in the Applied info SEC region right now

716
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:31,868
as an information security there's a lot

717
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:35,789
of people have also do compliance and

718
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:39,190
that kind of stuff which is fine but

719
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:42,759
knowledge is sparse right now for the

720
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:44,650
hackers perspective let's say so if you

721
00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:50,769
have played these kinds of the devs for

722
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:52,539
a bit you will most likely find a place

723
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:57,279
where you can each or place where you

724
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:59,160
can work or do both like me yeah so

725
00:36:57,279 --> 00:37:03,460
stick to PBL that's my advice

726
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:06,098
we had a very challenging course we

727
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:10,000
essentially throw everything we had at

728
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:12,160
our students almost and they managed

729
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,660
really well they said they invested in

730
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,670
our course a lot more than in all other

731
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:22,799
courses it was more like our course was

732
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:25,480
half of their time that semester but

733
00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:28,450
they're also us because we have a

734
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:31,000
scoreboard in our course and you need to

735
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,009
reach your threshold to pass the week

736
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,309
essentially we're playing a CTF every

737
00:37:33,009 --> 00:37:41,589
week and the threshold is not that high

738
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:43,569
but you can reach a lot more points if

739
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:46,420
you want to if you're interested in the

740
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:48,940
tasks and the working on is not so high

741
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:52,390
if you just want to pass but our

742
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:55,530
students really invested a lot of time

743
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:58,170
and a lot of them

744
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:01,410
at maximum points every week which is

745
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:06,060
awesome because the stuff was really

746
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:09,359
hard sometimes yeah

747
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:13,080
do not underestimate your sims I kind of

748
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:15,840
set that already some professors at our

749
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,270
university were like ok I need to make

750
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:23,400
my course easier because we have a

751
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:24,630
dropout rate of 50% and or comes off

752
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,190
really hard and we also had a dropout

753
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:31,470
rate of 50% so I think it's more likely

754
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:34,470
for you to underestimate your students

755
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:39,419
then you overestimate them so make the

756
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:42,629
stuff tough make it hard they'll manage

757
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,870
if they're interested they'll figure out

758
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:49,190
the stuff you'll be surprised how fast

759
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:53,430
especially young people but we also had

760
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:54,630
all the people in our course because

761
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,069
it's got a little bit popular and then

762
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:58,290
people from companies started coming as

763
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,510
well don't be surprised how fast they

764
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:07,890
pick up if they are really interested in

765
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:10,260
motivated yeah classical teaching in PBL

766
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:12,200
go three other very well so if you

767
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,400
already have a lecture on IT security

768
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,439
you don't have to change it you don't

769
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,210
have to replace it I'll just encourage

770
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,500
you to not a practical part with PBL

771
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,910
right now we're investigating if there's

772
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,130
also works for software engineering

773
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:28,350
lectures and that kind of stuff but I've

774
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:31,730
seen it work in multiple semesters were

775
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:35,970
all in this nagging sphere

776
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:40,070
last point very important enjoy yourself

777
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:43,790
you students have to see that you're

778
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:49,230
enjoying giving the lecture that you're

779
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:52,230
interested in topic and yeah don't take

780
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:54,060
yourself too seriously and it's

781
00:39:52,230 --> 00:40:05,060
important for you and if you like it

782
00:39:54,060 --> 00:40:05,060
your lecture will be better keep healthy

783
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:22,439
yeah by the way we opened a lap for the

784
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:27,510
students through to leverage the sizes

785
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:32,610
and at some nights I went home at 2

786
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:34,350
o'clock and they stayed at night and I

787
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:37,650
stated and somewhat during breakfast

788
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:40,860
time they went oh ok so thank you very

789
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:42,810
much I hope I taught you something I

790
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:45,300
know it was not very technical usually

791
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:48,540
the initials tend to get bored when L a

792
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,310
lecture is not technical but yeah I

793
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,110
encourage you to teach a king or to

794
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:54,960
learn a king because it's a lot of fun

795
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:56,730
you read great people and if you have

796
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,980
questions or feedback I know there's a

797
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,960
feedback form on the website you can do

798
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:04,440
that but you can also write me directly

799
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:08,190
and if you say the lecture sorry

800
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,360
there's also fine let's feedback that's

801
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,330
another thing I learned from the lecture

802
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,720
feedback is very valuable

803
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:18,120
well me it yeah I detect the rocks

804
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,839
organs it I'm a trainer at IPSec the

805
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:23,220
rocks we do trainings for defense stuff

806
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:37,770
yep so now I'm open for questions

807
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:39,870
and we're one thing you okay you've said

808
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:43,060
to avoid guessing we don't give us an

809
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:51,580
example of guessing there's a

810
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:52,900
um yes so there was a there's a big CTF

811
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:56,350
in Germany called the cybersecurity

812
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:58,780
Rumble we're just which was created by a

813
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:00,069
company we're gonna take it over we're

814
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,200
gonna host it next year so it's gonna be

815
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:04,170
better so if you're from Germany you can

816
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,879
participate we have awesome prices and

817
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:09,790
regellius

818
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:15,520
so they had a challenge in their first

819
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:17,890
issue I don't know if it's good example

820
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,140
we had an entry field and of course you

821
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:22,330
can do black box tech same text testing

822
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:26,379
on the entry field and people tried SQL

823
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:30,370
injections I quote injections whatnot

824
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:34,360
and nothing really worked and the

825
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:38,830
solution was you had on the PHP file a

826
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:42,960
get parameter debug equals one and then

827
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:44,890
it would show you some text of music

828
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,800
okay first of all you have to guess that

829
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:50,379
there's two back one you can test it

830
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,910
with tools but you donate during CD f's

831
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,830
you don't want to make any tasks where

832
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:55,359
you have to use to use tools choice

833
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,910
manual labor because there were you

834
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,160
learn so there's a CDF task for example

835
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,629
SQL injection it will always be built in

836
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,620
a way that has gum that doesn't work for

837
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:09,340
example so 12 is less doing suggests

838
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:14,049
yeah and then the solution was that you

839
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:18,700
had to import sequence of la Li and Lu

840
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:20,290
into the text field and you get the flag

841
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,509
and that's complete because

842
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:24,700
there's no surface in the world that

843
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:27,490
will ever do that it was pure guessing

844
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,250
it had nothing wrong with information

845
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:31,990
security whatsoever

846
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:34,360
there was another bad CDF at the guys a

847
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:36,479
tinkle through a washing detergent

848
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,630
guys I don't know where they're the CDF

849
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,489
No

850
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:42,319
we went there because they had prizes

851
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:45,859
and we won but it was complete

852
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:48,440
and data challenge where you download a

853
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:49,819
PDF and it's encrypted like okay let's

854
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,089
look at the encryption let's see you how

855
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:54,799
it's encrypted let's see if we can try

856
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:56,599
out like passwords automatically

857
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:58,940
brute-force a little bit and the

858
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:03,229
solution was the passport was hex

859
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:05,420
encoded appended to the PDF and it's

860
00:44:03,229 --> 00:44:07,999
nothing you would ever encounter in real

861
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,279
life doesn't it make sense you have to

862
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:11,868
guess that the challenge outdoor wanted

863
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:14,539
you to find this and that splits

864
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:16,460
guessing and if you do guessing and you

865
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:28,339
see Jefferson CTF time you're gonna be

866
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:30,619
bored and waited very very badly and see

867
00:44:28,339 --> 00:44:33,769
anybody has questions I'm gonna be

868
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:36,249
around just come to me and ask me or

869
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:36,249
write me an email
