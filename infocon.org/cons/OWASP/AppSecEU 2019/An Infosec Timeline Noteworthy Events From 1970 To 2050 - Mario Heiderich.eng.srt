1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,439
nice welcome to this keynote to this

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,700
closing nor which is called an InfoSec

3
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:15,750
timeline noteworthy events from 1970 to

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:18,299
2050 and first quick word about myself

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,710
my name is Mario I would call myself an

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,750
ex researcher because I don't do

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,430
research anymore but not my lecturer at

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,340
the rudin which is a rural university in

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,349
Bochum and I'm still running here 53

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,589
wrote a couple of books a couple of

11
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,860
papers and maintained right no dump Yura

12
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:36,600
Phi which is as you probably know a

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,700
browser based courses cryptic sanitizer

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,930
and the last weeks have been a pain in

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,850
the arse because we had a couple of

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,200
bypasses which you might have noticed

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,949
but we fixed them and I think we're good

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,360
again this is my latest hog and I think

19
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:49,920
this is pretty much the worst talk I've

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,230
ever done I have been trying to kind of

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,379
lower the quality with every talk in the

22
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,419
past years but I think I have reached

23
00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:00,718
pretty much the the like I don't think

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,250
there is like more room downstairs and I

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,480
noticed that this is actually quite hard

26
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,489
to accomplish because I wanted to do

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,110
like a closing note and with the closing

28
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,220
note you can't really go ahead and kind

29
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,440
of confront people with enough knowledge

30
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,700
or complex thoughts you just want to

31
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,380
have something that's like entertaining

32
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,630
and dull and just like you can lean back

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,339
and have a good evening and it's really

34
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,050
really complicated I was like maybe it's

35
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,520
gonna take me a week but it took me like

36
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:27,120
three weeks to deliver something that

37
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:30,360
has zero value and actually gonna enjoy

38
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,070
this so first we want to find out who's

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,810
actually here I was I always asked this

40
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,169
question so who here is a penetration

41
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:40,430
tester yes nice I'm a penetration tester

42
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:45,390
who he is a developer or defender yes

43
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:47,130
who here is an iOS or RC so nice I'm not

44
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,280
a nice oversee so who here's a bug

45
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:55,830
bounty hunter excellent we here's a

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,810
psychic anybody for enough we might need

47
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,789
them because you might need to support

48
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,410
me with my visions that are brought to

49
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,880
paper with this particular talk because

50
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,860
most of the stuff that is in this talk

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,270
actually never happened and I didn't

52
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,419
make it up it just came to me so you

53
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,889
can't blame me but we'll see about that

54
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:12,450
the talk structure is going like this in

55
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,519
act 1 we're gonna talk about the past

56
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,410
we're gonna talk about noteworthy events

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,150
that actually happened I believe at

58
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,400
least if they happen or some sources -

59
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,020
and those are events that had like great

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,350
relevance in the field of web security

61
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,300
information security and related areas

62
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:29,010
and in the second act off the talk we'll

63
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,870
talk about the future and this is this

64
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,489
mention that stuff that I made up but

65
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,980
this is stuff that actually came to me

66
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,230
during visions at night or in the sauna

67
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,739
or in the bathtub and it was just there

68
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,750
so it kind of tries to precise me tell

69
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,040
me infra sec future and if you don't

70
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,360
like it don't blame me because I didn't

71
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,920
make it up it just came to me like I'm

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,230
from somewhere else like a DDT or

73
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:54,209
substances I don't know but let's see so

74
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,519
one more important questions if there is

75
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,620
people amongst you who don't have plans

76
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,180
for tonight you can win a party ticket

77
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,650
because we have still another party

78
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,110
going on the All Stars party which is

79
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,620
gonna happen on a boat and we have four

80
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,780
more slots so those people who deliver

81
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,730
like the stupidest comments and the

82
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,350
snarky is questions are the best heckles

83
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,820
have the chance to actually win one of

84
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,500
these and then you can join us on a boat

85
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,880
there's free food there's free booze and

86
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,830
it's gonna be awesome there's gonna be

87
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,060
an after-party

88
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,470
do your best there is no such thing as a

89
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,790
plus-one if you have a plus-one you have

90
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,470
to ask two questions I mean that's quite

91
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,019
natural so show me your best

92
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:31,440
I already just start everybody restart

93
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,150
excellent so let's talk about the past

94
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,700
where everything was much better than it

95
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,030
is today of course and let's start with

96
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,519
the year 1990 1971 does anybody know who

97
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,140
that is

98
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,300
nice well done I wouldn't have known I

99
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,429
just like Google for the year 1971 and

100
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,950
check the image search and this was like

101
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,010
that that's good that looks just about

102
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,600
right so 1971 something interesting

103
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,640
happened because the first actual

104
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,980
computer worm was Korean was called

105
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,708
creeper who here still remembers creeper

106
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:05,640
anybody nobody so the author Bob Thomas

107
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,900
created a piece of software that was

108
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,820
supposed to just like balance between

109
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,350
computers between machines and it didn't

110
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,390
do anything else but that it's just like

111
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,920
bounced from machine to machine and left

112
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,390
a small message and basically said I'm

113
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,548
the creeper catch me if you can

114
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,349
of course it used some back to kind of

115
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,640
propagate and they had a hard time

116
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,600
actually catching it because through the

117
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,830
backup would bounce and bounce and

118
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,120
bounce and bounce but I wouldn't do

119
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,710
anything better but it was actually a

120
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,200
computer warm because the propagated on

121
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,930
its own through the use of a back

122
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,599
and there was a primary apparently and

123
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,400
it led instantaneously to the creation

124
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,740
of the first IVs of their is that

125
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,840
correct can you confirm this from every

126
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:43,760
vendor standpoint 76 I ever learned 71

127
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,880
but never I mean whatever of years

128
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,099
anyway so the first AV was actually

129
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,380
called Reaper and was having one task

130
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,840
and the task was to catch creeper so it

131
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,640
was technically another worm there was

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,989
bouncing from machine to machine and the

133
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,090
only thing that it actually did was the

134
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,280
beating creeper so things haven't

135
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,690
changed so much until today but anyway

136
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,580
the first one who actually created this

137
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,870
AV piece of software was right Amundsen

138
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,219
and it's mentions Co Reaper

139
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,020
I found this quite fascinating but it's

140
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:13,310
like really literally that long ago

141
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:15,650
almost four years then who's that yes

142
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,540
right well done well done well done

143
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,120
that's not gonna get you a party invite

144
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,430
you have to get better with that so

145
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,170
anyway that's kiss and in the year 1980

146
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,910
where kiss was really huge the first

147
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,830
actual intrusion detection system was

148
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,320
created and was created by the NSA

149
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,780
because basically someone there said

150
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,340
well there is such a thing as computer

151
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,750
intrusions like this stuff is clearly

152
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,310
getting popular we need to kind of do

153
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,860
something against this and it was James

154
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,900
Anderson of NSA who came up with a basic

155
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,910
idea and classified what kind of threats

156
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,590
they want to detect and basically what

157
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,070
he created was a toolkit that was like

158
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,590
easy

159
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:51,170
easing it for administrators and some of

160
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,700
the personnel to review user sxs locks

161
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,380
file access locks and all this kind of

162
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,420
stuff and kind of get it into an easily

163
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,890
digestible form but factually there was

164
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,050
an intrusion detection system because

165
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,640
was supposed to detect intrusions many

166
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,040
many years ago and in the same year

167
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,840
apparently the infamous group the for

168
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,660
one force were founded anybody still

169
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,700
remembers the for one force they are

170
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,530
described as a bunch of Milwaukee

171
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,640
teenagers and for one force actually

172
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,909
like the number called from Milwaukee

173
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:19,700
who use computers to do like shitty

174
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,310
stuff and screw people up and they were

175
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,289
apparently the first hackers that were

176
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,990
labeled as such who cost financial

177
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:29,540
damage and the legend has it that the

178
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:33,230
financial damage was round about $1,500

179
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,550
so not that much but they just deleted

180
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,310
some billing records from some company

181
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,790
they hacked the servers and then went

182
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,999
with that

183
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,019
and

184
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,699
that was quite interesting because

185
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,229
apparently that was the first group ever

186
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,299
noticed as such it's like an actual

187
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,709
hacking group alleged with causing

188
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:48,719
financial damage and religious like

189
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:51,539
trying to wreak havoc and destruction I

190
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:53,009
think in the end they were caught and it

191
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:55,259
was like interviews and there was like

192
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:57,709
people arity and then there was a book

193
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,509
and then no one spoke about them anymore

194
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:04,319
this is the year 1981 in which people

195
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:06,449
were really well-dressed and it's like

196
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,889
you punch this into Google and you find

197
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,399
this as an image search result so that's

198
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:14,069
the picture I want for this light good

199
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:18,479
nice anybody knows who that is is that a

200
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:20,369
bona that's not alright no nice nice I

201
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,899
would not know that and but one of the

202
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:23,159
problems that I was born this year so it

203
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,589
was just like really far too young to

204
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:26,998
actually notice that they were around

205
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:28,889
and I didn't find anything else from

206
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:30,119
that year that had relevance so we can

207
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:32,239
just probably move on from that slide

208
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:36,659
and go to the next one and look at 1986

209
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:42,869
with who is that George Michael

210
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:46,169
certainly that's a very good one mr. t

211
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:47,429
that's correct and Boy George right I'm

212
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:50,429
not really sure what happened in this

213
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:52,169
room they were having a good mood and I

214
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:56,599
think they had a good time so let's look

215
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:59,369
at it so in this particular year in 1986

216
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:01,349
astronomer Clifford Stoll captured

217
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:03,419
Markus Hess and Markus Hess was

218
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:06,029
allegedly a German hacker and a KGB

219
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:07,619
recruit and he was apparently one of the

220
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:11,009
people who managed to kind of infrared

221
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:14,249
US military systems and succeeded doing

222
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:16,979
that and stole a lot of data and cliffs

223
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:18,329
put up a honeypot so there was like a

224
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,099
brilliant idea back then because

225
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:21,299
apparently that was the first time that

226
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,759
ever someone came up with that

227
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:25,198
particular idea and indeed set up what

228
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,360
we know today is a honey pots or a

229
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,679
system that looks variable but isn't and

230
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,879
then queries so much information from

231
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:32,718
the attacker until they can actually

232
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,069
find that person and rate their house so

233
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,680
this year was the first year that

234
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:39,568
apparently had a politically motivated

235
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,739
hack at least the first documented one

236
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:41,250
maybe there's more but I don't know

237
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,680
about them

238
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,389
there is the first documented use of an

239
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,519
actual honeypot in the field of

240
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:49,500
cybercrime and there's also like the

241
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,620
first documented use ever of cyber

242
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,600
forensics because they kind of then

243
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,340
of course looked at the traces that mark

244
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,050
is left in the tiny pot and then a man

245
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,540
she managed to find him and put him in

246
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:03,620
jail quite tragic story even so but well

247
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,939
a lot of primers that year another thing

248
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,970
that happened this year was that the

249
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,830
first actual design for real IDs was

250
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,400
being modeled by Dorothea in tanning and

251
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:15,620
she was assisted by Peter G Newman and

252
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,060
they released this as a product which

253
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,310
was new back then because there was one

254
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,050
of the first actual InfoSec products

255
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,939
armed for like larger clients and

256
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,010
customers and it was released by the

257
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,910
company called s RI as intrusion

258
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:32,750
detection expert system so I DES and now

259
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:34,850
we have only IDs so the experts anyway

260
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,080
and it would both look at user and

261
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,660
network level data so it was quite

262
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,650
comprehensive and actually helped

263
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,480
catching the intrusion spec then there's

264
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,800
even a paper academic paper so people

265
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,960
put a lot of effort into that back then

266
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,760
and I really encourage you to check that

267
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,260
out because the basic mechanics of what

268
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,180
they created in that particular year

269
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,810
many many years ago it still would be

270
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:57,339
used today just with some added sugar

271
00:09:52,810 --> 00:10:00,050
then in 1997 who recognizes those two

272
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:04,820
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton

273
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:06,650
yes no no almost she was later starring

274
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,240
at first she was starring and terminated

275
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,949
in the later Terminator 2 and I think

276
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,270
there was some kind of weird series

277
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:14,090
about the Beauty and the Beast which

278
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:17,540
hopefully was a good one sorry I'm so

279
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:19,340
sorry I took my director Felix you're

280
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,959
close due to the reserving your ticket

281
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:25,700
to earn your ticket but not quite yet I

282
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:27,800
need to anymore yes we're coming to that

283
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:34,130
later on actually so don't don't steal

284
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:35,390
that first so in this year no 1987

285
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,280
someone made like a really interesting

286
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,470
statement I was computer scientist Fred

287
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,030
Cohan who noted the following he

288
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,430
basically said it is impossible

289
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:45,650
impossible to detect an intrusion in

290
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,239
every case and that the resources needed

291
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,600
to detect intrusions grow with the

292
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,340
amount of usage really no so you

293
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,020
can't have a system that detects all

294
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,880
attacks and they ever if they actually

295
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,890
figured that out in 1987 and I think

296
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,060
everybody here except for maybe some

297
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,860
marketing people might actually believe

298
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,219
that because you can't

299
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,480
sorry however we need to also look at

300
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,490
the other side of the metal and

301
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,550
basically Cohen also believe that

302
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:13,280
there's positive viruses and he even

303
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,870
himself created a positive virus that

304
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,209
would spread along the network and

305
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,010
infect your machine and then compress

306
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:25,130
your executables so you have more drive

307
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:26,420
space seeing this kind of statement and

308
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,030
comparing with the other one and putting

309
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,469
this into context kind of makes you want

310
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,790
to rethink whether this was so wise of

311
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:35,570
his statement but I still think this one

312
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,560
holds anyway so and your 1998 was that

313
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,290
who could that be

314
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,020
we had friends very nice Prinze was very

315
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,579
well known and another thing happened

316
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,430
that was quite well known because that

317
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:48,740
was the year when Sir Robert Morris had

318
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,770
an exciting an excellent idea because he

319
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:54,230
was like hmm I wonder how BIG's the

320
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,060
internet I don't know but I already

321
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,070
would like to know let's find out how

322
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,709
can we find out I could just write a

323
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,750
warm this guy propagates to every single

324
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,310
machine on the internet and just like

325
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,550
pings back how many machines there are

326
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,709
fantastic idea so he created that

327
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,300
software and he used another known bar

328
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,350
back then and just basically created a

329
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,089
software that went from machine to

330
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,530
machine with the aims with the goals of

331
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:18,140
creating and measuring the size of the

332
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,550
internet I think some of you might

333
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,100
already know that this particular thing

334
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,630
was not very successful so I'm not

335
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,300
really sure if he actually found out

336
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:28,730
about the size of the internet but well

337
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,959
other things happened because what he

338
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,490
created was effective for the more is

339
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,440
warm and he created like lots of

340
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,210
financial damage other people came up

341
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,000
with the same idea later on but he

342
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,740
really caused some damage and later in

343
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,960
1989

344
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,650
this is nuts loop knot this is Metallica

345
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,690
later 1989 it was analyzed by a couple

346
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,400
of entities that apparently the damage

347
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,810
that was caused by the Mora swarm was

348
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:55,310
somewhere between hundred K and ten mil

349
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,810
which leaves some wiggle room so it's

350
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,859
apparently very hard to measure that but

351
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,030
people were like really pissed about

352
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,920
this warm and that was like actual

353
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,910
financial damage compared to the 1.5 K

354
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,979
that the 404s apparently did again

355
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,370
Clifford Stoll saves the day the hopi

356
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,540
astronomer and was also aiding with

357
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,770
finding ways to cleanse machines from

358
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,030
the computers and so on I'm not really

359
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,300
sure why it is like part of the whole

360
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,640
thing

361
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,500
but he was present with all these

362
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,790
computer security incidents back then

363
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,560
and apparently had like a good hand for

364
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,540
that so they were very nice and another

365
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,430
thing that happened back then was that

366
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,510
effectively the first ransomware

367
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:32,150
was being created and unleashed in 1989

368
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:34,610
Iowa 98 sorry and it even it even had an

369
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,050
end user License Agreement so you would

370
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,880
actually kind of accept the agreement

371
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,319
when this thing runs but it was like a

372
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,900
hidden agreement and stuff like this and

373
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,430
what it did was it would replace your

374
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,079
auto exit but file who you still knows

375
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,280
order exit bug fights and conflicts and

376
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,980
all these things beautiful right I love

377
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,990
them as a child so the thing was doing

378
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,300
was that effectively after 90 reboots so

379
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,980
you have to reboot like don't shine this

380
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,750
message again you had to reboot like 90

381
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,190
times then all of a sudden this

382
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,780
particular software would hide your

383
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,490
directories and encrypt only the names

384
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,550
of all the files and then you had to

385
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:08,660
kind of send a check to a post-office

386
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:10,099
box and Panama with like 198 US dollars

387
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,930
and then you would eventually receive a

388
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,220
letter and this letter would give you

389
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,170
instructions on how good show to get

390
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,520
your files back so actually I think that

391
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,560
counts as the first render that wasn't

392
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,180
the first or was it just a very early

393
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,160
one my sources say it's the first but

394
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:26,510
maybe you know better yes nice

395
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,370
that's him by the way and as you can see

396
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,080
from from the TED Talks set up with all

397
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,060
the oscillators and all the cool tech

398
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,230
here that must have been quite awesome

399
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,939
and I would watch a talk I would love to

400
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,410
what you talk of his but I'm not sure if

401
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:40,130
he's still around but that was Clifford

402
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,600
Stoll actually then in 1990 a lot of

403
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,910
interesting things happened including

404
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,910
this very interesting photo bump here

405
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,939
like I had I had this weird effect so I

406
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,280
was googling like numbers just like your

407
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,980
numbers and starting from a certain year

408
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,420
on I every single time phone Trump and I

409
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,800
don't know why like every single year

410
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,449
which is like a Trump shoved in my face

411
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,589
and there was no way around this but

412
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,000
anyway like try this yourself

413
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,520
I had the result and I had it for all

414
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,160
the years for starting here too at some

415
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,380
point right now so no I mean you did

416
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,850
something right I guess so in this

417
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,189
particular year are things actually get

418
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:18,350
serious particularly hacking because it

419
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,080
gets it becomes illegal and that was the

420
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,510
year in which in the UK the computer

421
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,059
misuse Act was being released and

422
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,029
basically it said that

423
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:30,699
at any form of unauthorized attempts to

424
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:32,829
access computer systems is now illegal

425
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:34,478
people were protesting a lot back then

426
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:35,829
because the law was very weak and no one

427
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:39,429
actually knew what was illegal and what

428
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:43,118
wasn't but this is not something unheard

429
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:44,709
of so basically at some point people

430
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:47,199
were fine a bit with that and the dust

431
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:49,059
settled and the V Act was renovated here

432
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,738
and there and modified and amended and

433
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:52,478
whatnot but was the first year in which

434
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:54,249
apparently you couldn't hack anymore

435
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:57,459
without facing legal consequences which

436
00:15:54,249 --> 00:16:00,969
is quite interesting then and year 1981

437
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:04,299
was that nice it's very good very good

438
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:06,699
in this particular year the AV industry

439
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:08,348
strangely started booming because people

440
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,628
started to kind of get the concept of

441
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:11,409
virus and the virus is something bad you

442
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:14,109
don't want to have it on your computer

443
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:15,789
because then your computer gets sick so

444
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:17,559
you need medicine and that's particular

445
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:20,129
this product and it was hundreds of

446
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:22,179
products partly from the very very shady

447
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:23,619
companies that were flooding the market

448
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:25,779
they all did the same that basically all

449
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:29,019
kind of worked on building up a huge

450
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:30,429
database of checksums and signatures so

451
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,929
to say and then checking your disk

452
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:33,129
contents whether there was any match and

453
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:34,779
if that was the case then the stuff

454
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:37,239
would be quarantined or deleted or

455
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:39,609
something else happened the software

456
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:41,409
back then wasn't very great and people

457
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:44,469
complained a lot about for the Nerds

458
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:46,569
intense resource use massive user

459
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:47,829
frustration like people accidentally hit

460
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:49,628
their stuff removed and when there was

461
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:51,159
nothing nothing going on or the machine

462
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:52,719
was like slowed down to the very maximum

463
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,949
but it didn't matter because people

464
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:55,509
bought this particular software that

465
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:57,279
crazy because everybody had the idea

466
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:58,209
that it's actual medicine it was quite

467
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:03,279
interesting I think

468
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:05,289
then 1994 this particular challenging

469
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,849
photo was taken I don't think that would

470
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:08,019
be possible today would it and I think

471
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:10,599
that's a good thing like we would be

472
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:12,309
developed as mankind to the point of not

473
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:15,188
making this kind of photo anymore but

474
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:17,138
anyway it's a it's a monument of those

475
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:20,379
years and something really interesting

476
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:22,990
happened because in 1994 not only this

477
00:17:20,378 --> 00:17:25,839
photo was taken but also lamont Olli and

478
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:30,100
Jan Jan Andrea they write the initial

479
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:33,700
specification for cookies and the

480
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:36,219
specification made it into netscape 0.9

481
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,740
- better was released on October 13th

482
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,390
1994 and was the

483
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,559
first browser to ever support cookies

484
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,450
and as you can see this is like a

485
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,639
significant change a significant

486
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,790
revolution on the web because that kind

487
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,500
of removes the focus from websites and

488
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,389
gives us the ability to create web

489
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,010
applications like actual applications

490
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,240
that recognize the users and then do

491
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,250
stuff that is like only for that

492
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,690
particular user and so on needless to

493
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,790
say they filed a patent so cookie

494
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,679
technology is patented and it's like the

495
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,629
patent number five seven seven four six

496
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,470
seven zero that was granted even so in

497
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:08,910
year 1998 it was quite funny because

498
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,140
Microsoft saw this was a cuckoo Keys

499
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,520
that's actually quite cool but there's a

500
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,780
patent so whatever we need to kind of

501
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,280
buy this thing and then the release

502
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,928
internet explorer 2.0 and it also

503
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,760
supported cookies and all of a sudden

504
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:20,160
the web but much more interesting and

505
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,410
the funny thing is that no one noticed

506
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,030
like literally no one from the user base

507
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,340
was even aware of the fact that all of a

508
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,770
sudden there is no cookies it took a

509
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,240
long time around about a year for people

510
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:36,889
to figure out that something was going

511
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,890
on that was in the year 1995 or was it

512
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,940
well not quite yet

513
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,650
it took more time by the way in 1995

514
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,360
people started to take the worldwide web

515
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,250
more seriously because it was appearing

516
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,050
in mass media and was like more or less

517
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,059
universally accepted and they recognized

518
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,350
the new medium as such is something that

519
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,480
is not just for freaks and the celery

520
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,520
more and back then Netscape Navigator

521
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,620
was pretty much the most widely used web

522
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,510
browser it was like supreme superior to

523
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,428
all other browsers and Microsoft was

524
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,870
like panicking a little bit because they

525
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:05,700
basically said like well we need to kind

526
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,620
of also have a browser take note that

527
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,720
the cookie support came later but anyway

528
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,459
they also noticed that they need to do

529
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,500
something and then they licensed mosaic

530
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,510
like this old ancient prototype browser

531
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,179
from back then and based on that they

532
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,559
actually created ie one and then push

533
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,850
release after release with even the

534
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,200
second one in the same year that been

535
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,550
supported cookies and so on so that was

536
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,020
like very very fast-paced because

537
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,330
everybody got it like the web is here

538
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,760
and it's not gonna go anywhere so that

539
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,530
was fascinating days I was 14 I knew

540
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,050
nothing of that stuff back then I was

541
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:36,450
still playing with LEGOs I think well in

542
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,919
effect the web was starting to be

543
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,929
available for free to everybody because

544
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,400
bit in the early days Netscape actually

545
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,840
cost money so you have to pay for that

546
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,220
you have to pay for getting a software

547
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,139
that allows you to use the internet and

548
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,810
the Microsoft games is like yeah we're

549
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,370
gonna kind of destroy your business

550
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,830
we're gonna offer your bird our browser

551
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:53,389
for free and indeed they did and the

552
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,189
Netscape had to do the same and face

553
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,810
like lots of financial trouble and all

554
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,430
the other very popular browsers back

555
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,800
then like for example internet works

556
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,960
quarter-deck browser inter app and even

557
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,340
win tapestry they also kind of had to

558
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,290
release free versions because otherwise

559
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,879
they didn't have any chance to compete

560
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,340
with Microsoft anymore so a lot of stuff

561
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,960
happened back then and some people say

562
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,179
that in this particular year they

563
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,950
actually started the browser Wars and

564
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:19,250
the first browser Wars because meanwhile

565
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:21,170
we have three as far as I know you just

566
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,490
say in this particular year a very

567
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,400
important movie was released as well

568
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:27,050
that was hackers that gave attention to

569
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,910
the info SEC seen on the big screen and

570
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,379
some people actually liked that movie

571
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,590
including myself although it has a

572
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:37,060
couple of logic flaws but well anyway in

573
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:40,669
the year 1996 who remembers this band

574
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,929
acts I think it's the boy band with

575
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,580
girls or a government with boys I'm not

576
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,920
really super sure but probably the music

577
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,990
was great anyone like in this your geeky

578
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,460
you hear people noticed cookies like it

579
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,960
took two years for them to figure out

580
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,090
that something is going on that is

581
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,770
tracking information of theirs locally

582
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:57,020
and comparing this with server-side

583
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:59,900
information to give them identity on the

584
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,639
web because no one told them the cookies

585
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,440
were just there all of a sudden there

586
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,240
was no notifications like hey we have

587
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,320
cookies now and they can do this and

588
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,470
this and that good stuff and bad stuff

589
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,050
but they just appeared and it was the

590
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,370
Financial Times who found it out there

591
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,570
was a big scoop and some of the

592
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,919
reporters actually looked at the

593
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,720
browser's and realized oh there is

594
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,580
something that is tracking information

595
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,290
and then they did a piece on that and

596
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,360
people realized there is something in

597
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,430
our browsers that is like wrecking us

598
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,810
and doing evil things and that actually

599
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,580
made some waves back then people were

600
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,230
like dad scared about cookies I mean

601
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,790
needless to say you can use cookies for

602
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,080
bed and you can't use them for good but

603
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,060
people were completely scared about

604
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,060
cookies being used for bet and even went

605
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:40,159
that far that like newspapers with like

606
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,669
decent random may recommend it to people

607
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,530
to kind of turn off cookies entirely and

608
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,570
then they had their PHP session ID in

609
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:49,520
the URL and they would send it out links

610
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,379
with ICQ and then other people were them

611
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,629
so there was not a great idea but it

612
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,400
even made it up to the US FTC and there

613
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,570
was like hearings multiple hearings and

614
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,470
people were like really scared about

615
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,090
cookies

616
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,160
I mean if something like this came out

617
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,320
today people would be like you just

618
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,920
another one but back then they were like

619
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:12,470
out of their minds incredible so who's

620
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:16,360
that now you have your side anyway

621
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,360
that's the dude that's not marching so

622
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:24,590
this year the big live ask you anyway in

623
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,190
this year next to the to the big

624
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,929
lebowski

625
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,330
they also realized that there is a thing

626
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,650
called sequel injection and they're had

627
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,199
their minds blown they were like what

628
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:35,930
you can concatenate user input into

629
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,600
existing queries how do you this is

630
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:41,150
magic voodoo how do you do this yet but

631
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,740
just concatenating oh my god that were

632
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,630
completely freaked out and was first

633
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,580
documented by Jeff Forrest alarm what

634
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,070
went by the by the nickname rainforest

635
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,379
puppy or RFP and apparently the first

636
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:54,970
source ever documenting sequel injection

637
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:58,190
was the frack magazine an issue number v

638
00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:00,230
54 and before that no one actually knew

639
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,810
that kind of problem and he stated that

640
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,520
people can possibly piggyback SQL

641
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:08,120
commands into your statements and people

642
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,770
were like what there's a story going

643
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,449
around where people were like so mind

644
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,129
blown about this that he went around in

645
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,660
the states and do consulting and he

646
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,310
would ask for like daily rates of like

647
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,720
seven thousand dollars because people

648
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,070
were ready to pay that because his

649
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,050
calendar was so booked us and I come to

650
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:23,330
us explain that's concatenation but

651
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:24,740
anyway the only good thing back then was

652
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,899
that most websites actually didn't have

653
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,790
any databases they usually just like

654
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,280
talk to something like MSX s style

655
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:33,260
directly so it wasn't that bad and this

656
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,639
was just like building up and Microsoft

657
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,470
also stayed quite cool because they were

658
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,550
like yeah it's actually not that bad I

659
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:42,890
would worry about that yeah sure

660
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:44,810
that was not the best prediction that

661
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,730
Microsoft ever did in terms of security

662
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,990
but they did a really good one in the

663
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,090
year when Fight Club came out because

664
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,100
they realized for the first ones or

665
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,389
being the first ones that there is a lot

666
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,790
of potential in cross-site scripting

667
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,260
because basically nsrc figured out that

668
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:59,240
cross the scripting is a massive threat

669
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,500
that is actually already being used and

670
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,680
it's hard to track you have to check

671
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,390
your locks and whatnot and try to

672
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,700
formalize the whole thing by giving it a

673
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,050
name and releasing some papers that

674
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,110
basically state what it is and what you

675
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,750
can do against this

676
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:14,040
and as we all know 20 years later it's

677
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,720
still one of the most common vapor

678
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,059
abilities and it was only discovered

679
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,100
more or less by accident because someone

680
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,389
noticed that something is quite fishy

681
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,889
and that someone might have the

682
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,660
possibility to steal your cookies and do

683
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,730
good stuff will it do bad stuff with it

684
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,350
in the same year the first Web

685
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,210
Application Firewall gets built and the

686
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,740
first units get sold and the company is

687
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,390
called perfecto technologies anybody

688
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,990
here from perfect air technologies is

689
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:38,850
that company still around no and they

690
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,590
called an app shield and was the first

691
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,480
Web Application Firewall even call like

692
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,340
that and it was strangely targeting

693
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,110
ecommerce because we made the experience

694
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,530
that ecommerce is the last of all

695
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:52,110
industries that cares about IT security

696
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:53,460
so anyway they targeted them and maybe

697
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,439
then the company disappeared but they

698
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,030
targeted a lot of attacks as well so for

699
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,799
example people back then were scared of

700
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,330
hidden field manipulation that's the

701
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,730
actual list of features that it had back

702
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:05,340
then hidden field manipulation cookie

703
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:08,790
poisoning parameter tempering buffer

704
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:11,220
overflow cross-site scripting backdoor

705
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,510
or debug options stealth commanding I'm

706
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,210
not real sure what that is so I'm

707
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,070
explaining that forced browsing I think

708
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,030
that means you serve third party

709
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,620
misconfigurations

710
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,080
and known role abilities and that was

711
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,399
the feature list in 1999 and if you

712
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,949
compare with feature list of today

713
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,790
there's not that much difference I guess

714
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:34,950
anyway we move on to the year 2001 in

715
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:37,770
which ie6 was literally the best browser

716
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:40,770
ever but even better than I fi five and

717
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:42,389
if you combine both browsers in terms of

718
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,830
market share in terms of users you would

719
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,450
see that that pretty much ruled the

720
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,850
entire internet like combined they had

721
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:50,160
95 percent market share everybody was

722
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,889
using ie including myself I was a

723
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,240
student back then and I was quite

724
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,770
fascinated by the internet I had like

725
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,770
modem and I asked the N connections were

726
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:00,120
very slow but I was like so enchanted by

727
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,410
all the toolbars I all of a sudden it's

728
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,270
like all those new features and

729
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:04,890
functionalities volatilize I had just

730
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,139
have to go there and whoops I have a new

731
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,490
toolbar that is so convenient and there

732
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,820
was pretty much daily business back then

733
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,020
and well one of the problems that

734
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,280
happened back then is the Microsoft

735
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,559
didn't even want to put too much more

736
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,178
investment into ie for various reasons

737
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,389
including legal ones and they basically

738
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:23,070
left the browser as it was which was of

739
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,490
course a terrible state because it was

740
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,710
built in

741
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,670
and a lot of Bucks were in there but

742
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,980
anyway I'm gonna talk about that later

743
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,870
in the same year according to my sources

744
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,370
they also started the August project by

745
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,500
Mark Murphy and joined by Jeff Williams

746
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,780
s volunteer chair of August so this was

747
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,309
the year in which it all began and in

748
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:41,160
the same year a lot happened back then

749
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:43,290
researchers discovered Caesar they were

750
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,420
like oh you can actually trigger

751
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,399
requests from a different origin and

752
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,870
they still have the cookies because the

753
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,390
browser can't tell apart from where they

754
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,340
come and in this particular year first

755
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:56,700
exploits apparently started popping up

756
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:58,139
in the wild researchers also quickly

757
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,700
figured out that there's like literally

758
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,350
no chance to actually finding out

759
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,940
whether you had Caesar or whether you

760
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,949
were attacked by AC server attack or not

761
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,600
because you wouldn't see it in the logs

762
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,160
it's just a regular request coming from

763
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,040
your machine so there was like a very

764
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,050
very tricky buck and showing us a bit

765
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,540
more impressively that there is no way

766
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,649
to detect all possible intrusions you

767
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,050
just need to kind of build something

768
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:22,500
against them but to detect C serve you

769
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:27,120
can really have a hard time then in the

770
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:30,270
year 2002 who's that ready yes reading

771
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,800
becomes popular and the EU arm probably

772
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,270
inspired by that launch the directive

773
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,070
and privacy and electronic

774
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,750
communications and there was another

775
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:39,000
reaction to cookies because users now

776
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,559
all need to consent to the use of

777
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,030
cookies that's when this whole thing

778
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,530
started with the hey this website is

779
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,389
using cookies do you really want that or

780
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:47,910
not what can we do to make you life even

781
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:49,950
harder and there was a paragraph that

782
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,900
basically specified clearly that there

783
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:55,559
must be a possibility given to the user

784
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,480
of denying any form of storage operation

785
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:59,250
by the web such any any form of

786
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,550
operation that that can store anything

787
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,870
of whatever kind and website owners were

788
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,720
confronted with a heart problem because

789
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,820
table was not that easy and very much

790
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,490
important this year a very well-known

791
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,770
attack gets discovered too and that is

792
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,990
clickjacking clickjacking got discovered

793
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,639
by Jesse Ruderman and unfortunately he

794
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,200
didn't design a logo because that kind

795
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,000
of marketing strategy wasn't around back

796
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,000
then but he just filed the back ticket

797
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,350
on bugzilla and well the effect was that

798
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,270
no one noticed that and I think the

799
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,899
ticket was actually still there is it

800
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:31,950
fixed no right because there's no fix

801
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,260
it's it's not exact

802
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:36,409
and well he found out that there's a

803
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:39,320
possibility to make iframes transparent

804
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:40,700
but his own marketing skills were not

805
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,158
good enough to kind of make people aware

806
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,289
of the actual risks so this particular

807
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,120
attack was lumbering in its secret cave

808
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:48,559
that was Bugzilla for a very long time

809
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,969
and it took a couple of years for some

810
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,460
people to rediscover it when I talked

811
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,500
about that in a sec what security gets

812
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,880
kicked off in the same year 2002 a web

813
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,799
application firewall for people without

814
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,500
big wallets awesome projects still alive

815
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:02,418
and started by ivan research who's now I

816
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:07,970
think still at SSL UPS or something like

817
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:10,940
this I'm not super sure oh okay sorry

818
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,750
hired no it's true yeah anyway so that

819
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,220
was good theory kicked off in this

820
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:17,179
particular year and we can move on to

821
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:18,860
year 2003 what's that who knows okay I

822
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:20,269
still have four of these things I'm a

823
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,340
kind of kind of a bit disappointed

824
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:27,110
I need more interactivity here no

825
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:32,840
heckling no questions no comments that

826
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:36,110
was good but not good enough all right

827
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,510
a 2003 a very very famous group was

828
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:40,340
started and was the group Anonymous and

829
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:42,980
they often became labeled as

830
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,899
international activist group with pretty

831
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,360
much admission but no one knew what

832
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:49,459
admission was and they also used this

833
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:54,799
very very characteristic sign of theirs

834
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:56,510
which was the key Foxx mask me know I

835
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,600
was far too stupid for these kinds of

836
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:01,100
things 2003 I was still I think in like

837
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,418
second semester and learned basic math

838
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,830
so no well they were alleged to have

839
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:08,330
committed a variety of cyber crimes

840
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,590
there was love lots of allegations and

841
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,389
lots of attribution no one really knows

842
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,039
what they actually did or who was where

843
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:15,439
and what was happening here there was a

844
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,269
couple of arrests but it was noted by

845
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,950
some CEOs that indeed the mask sales

846
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:20,450
went up because no one would buy this

847
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,190
much before and all of a sudden people

848
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,840
did so there was companies that actually

849
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,909
were created just to sell those masks

850
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,470
because of anonymous fair enough but

851
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:28,610
more importantly the Oberst attempt

852
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:30,649
project gets published for the first

853
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,908
time and I think one can safely say at

854
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:33,979
least the internet says though that the

855
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:36,110
Oeste 10 project is pretty much the most

856
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,299
cited document in information security

857
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,918
history like no there is no other

858
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:42,019
document no other paper that has been

859
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,220
cited more often than the OS top ten so

860
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:47,750
that's quite a decent success I would

861
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:49,110
say then in 2004 things get even more

862
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,780
interesting

863
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:53,459
this is Mark Zuckerberg on non tape and

864
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,930
I think he got confronted with some some

865
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,830
data leakage so here to kind of burp in

866
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:59,970
surprise and you need to follow the

867
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,050
president's amazing that actually

868
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:04,050
happened back then already just no one

869
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:05,700
cares and in this particular year that

870
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,919
was like the first well-known and

871
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,870
documented mass exploitation of ie box

872
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,280
those needless to say everybody was

873
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,719
still using ie like crazy

874
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,639
that was the browser with the market

875
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,560
share of 95 percent so it was like the

876
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,960
most juicy possible attack target that

877
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,840
you could have and one of the more Bears

878
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,510
actually did it and managed to kind of

879
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,149
infect more than tens of millions of

880
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:28,890
users pcs and it was exclusively through

881
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,480
ie security boxy but just like chain a

882
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,460
couple of bars he would visit a web site

883
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,290
then where the HTML and the JavaScript

884
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,210
code was hidden and then boom you

885
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,830
machine was backyard probably the

886
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,810
toolbars that I caught while browsing

887
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,639
the map the web very naively were coming

888
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,990
from this particular Trojan and probably

889
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,610
I caught it myself and I would even

890
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:46,410
assume that probably 50% of the room

891
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:47,729
here also had this kind of Trojan at

892
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,410
some point on some machine in their

893
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:52,260
lives because it was really that popular

894
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:55,020
and getting will from there as well

895
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,610
firefox 1.0 was released with huge bus

896
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,110
in germany we had like this campaign

897
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,790
with like a newspaper print out i think

898
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:02,669
it was like an entire page that's a fire

899
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:04,139
or foil or something like this and they

900
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,750
really tried to kind of get people away

901
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,580
from IE which was a good thing first

902
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:11,040
they called it phoenix which was a super

903
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:13,260
nice name but then the bios manufacturer

904
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,570
called phoenix technologies realized

905
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,370
that they have a browser to but it's

906
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,480
like a bios based browser and i don't

907
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,820
even know what that means

908
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,130
so they threatened to sue because their

909
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:25,649
thing was called phoenix first where

910
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:27,030
connect and yeah then phoenix didn't

911
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:29,910
happen but firefox happened which I

912
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:32,040
think sounds a bit better and before

913
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:34,260
Firefox was pushed away by Chrome and

914
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,480
began in slow down fall said downfall in

915
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,860
2010 and rapidly gained market share and

916
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,570
everybody's using Firefox everybody who

917
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,010
was cool was using Firefox and one can

918
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:43,620
safely say that the second browser worse

919
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:45,960
were beginning and lasted from 2004 to

920
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:48,149
2007 teen 13 years and one of the

921
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,060
results there was that in April 2004 the

922
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:53,670
what WG was created to kind of counter

923
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,770
the slowness of the w3c and find a way

924
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,150
to actually get the standards and the

925
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,860
specs up to par with what people

926
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:01,250
actually want with what people actually

927
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,250
need

928
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:07,290
in 2005 this movie came out which was

929
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:10,310
the movie that was an easy one

930
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:12,810
I made it very easy but good well on

931
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:14,909
random where became more public about

932
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,350
popular and more sophisticated and there

933
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,970
was a couple of Venza more families

934
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,350
according to my sources which might be

935
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,820
wrong but you can correct me because

936
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,800
you're sitting in the front row and you

937
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,169
know this stuff like for example GP code

938
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,120
are keavy used cotton or k rotten and

939
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:29,700
may archive and they started to actually

940
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,620
utilize RSA encryption and the key size

941
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,620
was increasing as was the performance of

942
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:36,689
computers and apparently GB code in the

943
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,000
variation AG which was detected in June

944
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:41,640
2006 had a key that was like whopping

945
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,560
660 bits so that was pretty good and

946
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,300
much more important in that year the

947
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,800
semi warm was released because Samy

948
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,629
Kamkar apparently wanted to impress his

949
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,399
girlfriend as he said himself and kind

950
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,930
of show her her popular he is on MySpace

951
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,310
because myspace was still a thing back

952
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:58,200
then and he created a software that he

953
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:59,909
basically could put on his own profile

954
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,400
and then it would kind of add everybody

955
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:04,170
or make him be edit to everybody's

956
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,880
friend list who's visiting that profile

957
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,140
and then he was realizing that was a

958
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,940
little bit slow and he wanted to have

959
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,560
more friends and more shared connections

960
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,300
and then he says like well if I can put

961
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,918
this on my profile I can maybe also put

962
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,840
this on other people's profiles and then

963
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,060
I get more friends over time much faster

964
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,280
but what he forgot that the whole thing

965
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:24,330
was kind of going exponentially and then

966
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,370
myspace was down for three days and the

967
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:29,069
United States Secret Service raided his

968
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:30,899
house and they found his house by

969
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,879
looking at license plates of photos that

970
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:34,319
someone in his vicinity or himself

971
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,750
posted at some points it was pretty

972
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,429
adventurous and yeah then he went to

973
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,260
jail and then he couldn't use computers

974
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:42,200
for a while so please don't write excess

975
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,070
worms because that might actually happen

976
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,388
other people didn't listen to that

977
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,879
advice and became actually computer

978
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:51,320
criminals and the gang around Roberto

979
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:57,089
Gonzales they stole apparently at least

980
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:59,460
45 54.7 45-foot service I'm really bad

981
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:01,880
with numbers payment card credentials

982
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:07,790
used by customers of the US retailer TJX

983
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:10,890
and this cost the company an apparent

984
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:13,740
256 million u.s. dollars which was

985
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:15,270
really expensive at that time so I think

986
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,799
that was one of the the cyber

987
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,270
crimes are one of the attacks back then

988
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,640
there was like the most yielding one

989
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,810
actually in the most painful one 2007 I

990
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,009
don't have discussions about this

991
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,900
particular picture because everybody

992
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,940
knows there was an interesting situation

993
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,980
coming up where all of the sudden all

994
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,600
researchers in all open-source tools

995
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,330
were using like web applications

996
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,520
scanning as their main purpose were

997
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:37,230
threatened because it showed that a

998
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,940
company called sin-sick and I hope I get

999
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:42,060
the facts right here filed a lawsuit

1000
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:45,120
against SPI dynamics because Sen sig was

1001
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:47,040
awarded a patent for so-called fault

1002
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,560
injection technology and they basically

1003
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,910
managed to get a patent to be awarded

1004
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:55,680
for trying dirty and nasty user input

1005
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,960
against web applications and seeing what

1006
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,669
happens which is pretty much which any

1007
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,030
scanner does was any pen gesture does

1008
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,950
and patent lawyers didn't really see it

1009
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,080
back then and kind of didn't get to the

1010
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,399
point of saying no we can't do this so

1011
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,310
they got the patent granted and then

1012
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,860
they started to sue but the community

1013
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:15,180
was very angry um the fancy website was

1014
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,280
hacked and defaced and there was like

1015
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,899
cross-site scripting and whatnots and

1016
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,300
eventually it got settled because HP

1017
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,770
bought SPI dynamics and HP was too big

1018
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,970
of a chunk so since it was like scared

1019
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,170
and then basically says like yeah when

1020
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,250
I'm gonna sue you anymore the reached an

1021
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,870
agreement they got some millions and

1022
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,340
everything was good again but people are

1023
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,109
still a bit scared in the legal field of

1024
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,940
this particular case because this is

1025
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,860
still a bad patent um we never saw

1026
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,270
anything bad happening with cookies and

1027
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,440
we never saw anything bad happening with

1028
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,180
Oracle owning in the trademark

1029
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,500
JavaScript for example but here we

1030
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,060
actually had someone attacking someone

1031
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,290
else for something that we would just

1032
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,880
like generally described as scanning

1033
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,460
technologies and that looks quite

1034
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,560
critical actually let's see I tried to

1035
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,090
find a picture from the year 2008 but

1036
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,400
there's the stupid car that is called

1037
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,540
2008 so this is what I found so it was

1038
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,140
like at some point I was like I'm just

1039
00:36:54,540 --> 00:37:00,090
gonna give up sorry for that retro where

1040
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,830
it gets more sophisticated they use

1041
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:03,720
bigger keys and more sophisticated

1042
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:05,759
encryption technologies and another

1043
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,410
variation of another variant of GP Co

1044
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,660
was detected that was the first one to

1045
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,100
apparently use like a 1024 bit RSA keys

1046
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,140
that it's that accurate that's making

1047
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:16,740
sense it was on the internet so I

1048
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:18,660
believed it okay it was deemed to be

1049
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,979
infeasible to break encrypted the

1050
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,240
encryption in this particular case

1051
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,240
before that it was apparently still

1052
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,490
possible and people realized oh if this

1053
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,839
keeps on going on

1054
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,640
I have a real problem with ransomware

1055
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,830
and we still have a problem which we

1056
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,690
could see from your talk Caston

1057
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,279
yesterday so no one actually managed to

1058
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:36,080
fix it

1059
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,230
click J King gets rediscovered six years

1060
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:43,490
late and I think they probably read like

1061
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:45,770
Jesse rudiments ticket and contrary to

1062
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,879
Jesse Jeremiah and Robert actually

1063
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:49,369
figured out how to market this thing

1064
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,320
really really well and they had I think

1065
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:53,030
like a Nova's New York talk and I think

1066
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,310
that one was pulled because Adobe was

1067
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:57,700
making a drama because they found out

1068
00:37:55,310 --> 00:38:00,410
that you can actually click Jack the

1069
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,330
camera settings from the Adobe Flash

1070
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,740
Player and then turn on people's cameras

1071
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:05,029
and if they didn't notice that there was

1072
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,640
like a green light all of a sudden

1073
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,900
glowing then their video was on some

1074
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,480
server somewhere on the internet and

1075
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:15,920
people were having a lot of fun so this

1076
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:30,080
talk didn't happen huh yeah but the gist

1077
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:32,470
is one if you don't have any plans will

1078
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:37,790
see if so then pass it on please

1079
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:40,910
all right 2013 the earth was supposed to

1080
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:45,130
be hit by the meteor unfortunately it

1081
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:46,759
didn't happen according to the press I

1082
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,190
mean we're still here

1083
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,600
so unless I'm making all this up anyway

1084
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,340
so it didn't happen but again more

1085
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,560
ransomware it gets more expensive and

1086
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,580
more brutal and more effective and in

1087
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,200
this particular year apparently

1088
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,779
cryptolocker heads which is still

1089
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,899
gaining some some prominence and they

1090
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:05,570
according to ZDNet managed to kind of

1091
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:10,040
collect within a time frame of four days

1092
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:12,859
the amazing sum of 27 US dollars and

1093
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,050
nearly 27 billion US dollars by using

1094
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:17,390
the Bitcoin from the victims four days

1095
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:20,869
twenty seven mil there's quite a lot of

1096
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:23,180
think that's a primer actually and more

1097
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:24,890
importantly for us as web people iframes

1098
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,410
get a sandbox to be more secure because

1099
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:29,150
until then we were using iframes left

1100
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,140
and right the content of the iframe

1101
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:32,180
could pretty much do whatever they

1102
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,740
wanted so when there was like bad code

1103
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,819
and said that iframe from an advertiser

1104
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,129
or anything like that

1105
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,580
well it which is execute and there was

1106
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,260
no restrictions possible aside

1107
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,750
this binary mode that ie provided with

1108
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,240
like restricted frames and this change

1109
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:47,090
in this particular year and strangely I

1110
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,649
frames hand box is still a feature

1111
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:52,920
despite it being very very awesome that

1112
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:54,600
is almost not used by anybody except for

1113
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,030
security resources trying to break it

1114
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,589
because we rarely see the iframe sandbox

1115
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,970
in action and some web application we

1116
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,440
see it but not where you're actually

1117
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:03,810
wanted which is like advertising

1118
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,580
tracking and comparable stuff but anyway

1119
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:11,240
it was there and people could use it

1120
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:11,240
just didn't so this is combat juggling

1121
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,540
apparently you juggle and then you fight

1122
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,230
at the same time there's a championship

1123
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:21,930
I never tried it I was hoping that

1124
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:27,630
someone here could demonstrate and get

1125
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:29,460
the combat juggling I think the first

1126
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,660
common chaplain Corps combat juggling

1127
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,980
championship was happening in this

1128
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,450
particular year and that's how Google

1129
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,300
Images gave me that particular image

1130
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:38,339
anyway this is fun because in this

1131
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,190
particular Uribe got hacked and a lot of

1132
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,780
PII was leaking we had 145 million users

1133
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,580
affected and Pierre such as names

1134
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,130
addresses dates of person all sorts of

1135
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,840
stuff got leaked and then they found out

1136
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:51,990
that the attackers were apparently like

1137
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,220
a whopping total of 229 days inside a

1138
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,689
base network and they used social

1139
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,189
engineering because they didn't use any

1140
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:57,660
technological attacks the basically

1141
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,950
called them pretended to be employees

1142
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,270
got some credentials and then they were

1143
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:03,899
in less than the basic state their

1144
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:05,790
harvest the data and nobody noticed well

1145
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,970
and then something rather sad happened

1146
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:12,090
because the CEO back then John Donaghy

1147
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:13,620
he basically said yeah well that was

1148
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:16,440
really bad with like the hundred forty

1149
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:18,600
five million users but I mean we noticed

1150
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,070
like a slight decline in user activity

1151
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,440
but bottom line it didn't really matter

1152
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:24,390
it had no impact it was like wait you

1153
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,950
get compromised you have like 145

1154
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,359
million credentials leaked and you

1155
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,890
basically tell to the press that it

1156
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,750
didn't really matter so much that's not

1157
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:33,930
good like that's that's not good for us

1158
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:37,710
in here but factually a base quarter to

1159
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:40,049
revenue and 2014 was up by 13% and

1160
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:41,490
earnings were up by 6% so they really

1161
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:43,230
didn't notice like it was a massive

1162
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:46,618
breach and no one in the end care

1163
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:48,390
because it had no impact too bad

1164
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:50,670
then one of the most important movies uh

1165
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:53,879
sorry natural then one of the most

1166
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:55,619
important movies and 2015 got released

1167
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,700
and it almost didn't disappoint anyone

1168
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:01,109
here so another thing that also didn't

1169
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,460
disappoint anyone was that an era of

1170
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:05,219
glory and triumph ended because

1171
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,869
Microsoft finally abandoned ie

1172
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:08,219
and when we all know that they didn't

1173
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:10,259
really it's still there we have like

1174
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:11,880
this beautiful shiny mode of ie

1175
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:15,210
inside edge that we can activate with

1176
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,489
like domain policies but they sort of

1177
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:19,920
buried ie and they kind of released edge

1178
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:22,049
it was actually better I had a better

1179
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,849
engine it was faster at a new low of new

1180
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:25,890
features better security we actually

1181
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:27,749
looked at that back then and it was not

1182
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:29,279
that bad but it didn't really take off

1183
00:42:27,749 --> 00:42:31,828
because the days were over was just like

1184
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:33,749
a tad too late and unfortunately it

1185
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:46,529
didn't have the desired effect and now

1186
00:42:33,749 --> 00:42:50,999
the situation is yes please edge will

1187
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:54,329
now use link that's the Google Chrome

1188
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:58,140
engine most welcome I mean it's better

1189
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:59,489
than WebKit so I mean they could use

1190
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,109
gecko but I'm not sure if that would be

1191
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:05,130
I don't know Adam that's too much

1192
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:06,710
politics it was a good question

1193
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:16,369
[Applause]

1194
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:16,369
since it's actually they're easy what

1195
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:21,989
that's a good question but no but that's

1196
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:25,920
not worth the ticket has to be a better

1197
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:28,170
one sorry hey guess who came back in

1198
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,329
2016 I was so glad to see Britney was

1199
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:33,569
back after a long break and at the same

1200
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:35,430
time we realized that Caesar is that we

1201
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:37,558
just don't get it which is a pun to my

1202
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:39,660
own talk title from last year because in

1203
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,460
this year in 2016 not only Britney came

1204
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,609
back but also Google Chrome released

1205
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,979
same site cookies in version number 51

1206
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:49,288
and that was actually quite major it was

1207
00:43:46,979 --> 00:43:51,618
a tiny change but yeah there's a

1208
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:51,619
question

1209
00:43:53,070 --> 00:44:03,980
I'm actually more on the side of free

1210
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:06,540
Brittany but like I'm two steps ahead I

1211
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,220
have one I have one left so now I'm

1212
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,509
gonna be really really critical so this

1213
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:13,589
one needs to Cowen this has to be a

1214
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:16,230
really good one so see Cerf was pretty

1215
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:18,960
much dead because actually no sir

1216
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:20,280
actually with same set cookies active

1217
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,690
you can't do this or anyone that's a

1218
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,180
great thing and another fun thing

1219
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,520
happened and there was effectively

1220
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,470
another breach that also had

1221
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,759
consequences but not as many as it

1222
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:31,740
probably should have had because yahoo

1223
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,220
got hacked remember this one that was so

1224
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:37,140
so good so in September 2016 when they

1225
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,450
negotiated with Verizon about getting

1226
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:42,120
bharwa know why you would buy Yahoo but

1227
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:44,040
anyway whenever she ating about getting

1228
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,600
bought they were like yeah but something

1229
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,640
happened you know like this tiny you

1230
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,470
tiny thing and was probably like state

1231
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,450
sponsor and very sophisticated advanced

1232
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:53,459
persistent threat and definitely not

1233
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,379
script kiddies and someone kind of

1234
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,270
managed to compromise like 500 million

1235
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,880
user accounts of ours like entirely with

1236
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:02,340
plaintext passwords so can we now move

1237
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,860
on with the agenda and people like no

1238
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,240
and then December like the same year the

1239
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,920
number was corrected because we're like

1240
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,620
yeah but we kind of also noticed that it

1241
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,480
was not not exactly 500 million it was a

1242
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,880
little bit more because we're actually a

1243
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,180
billion so I mean million billion

1244
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,100
whatever and so they were quite cool

1245
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,509
about this and then it took another year

1246
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,650
to actually process anyone watched the

1247
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:26,520
movie I didn't watch it it's too creepy

1248
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:28,650
but they figured out that it was not

1249
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,360
just like 1 billion because they found

1250
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,010
out that it was actually three billion

1251
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,470
accounts one year later that there was

1252
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:36,150
like multiple groups acting on their

1253
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:37,560
servers and parallel pretty much kicking

1254
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,540
themselves of those servers because hey

1255
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,240
were with her first and that every

1256
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:44,850
single user account they ever had was

1257
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,439
compromised all three billions that has

1258
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:48,720
never happened before I think that like

1259
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,080
website with so many accounts and every

1260
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,459
single account gets compromised Cromie

1261
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,290
was dominating the web with pretty much

1262
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,510
60 percent users share and more in

1263
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:59,670
andreas gal from Mozilla CTO publicly

1264
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:01,320
state that Google Chrome has won the

1265
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:02,370
second browser war and here it actually

1266
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,750
ended

1267
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:05,160
and see servers actually dead and is

1268
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,840
dead in all browsers we don't still

1269
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,609
really use that feature but meanwhile

1270
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,160
almost all relevant browsers actually

1271
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:13,920
support same side cookies even Safari

1272
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,420
which took a while so that's actually

1273
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,980
quite good I think the only browser that

1274
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,170
is commonly used right now and not

1275
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,520
supporting same side is ie 11 but

1276
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,870
correct me if I'm wrong not sure maybe

1277
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:32,640
there was a patch but I don't think so

1278
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:34,319
okay okay so it's it's on a different in

1279
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,299
a different level on the stack okay if

1280
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:40,530
that makes sense cool thank you you

1281
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:41,730
haven't take it off and then the one

1282
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,100
thing that was not supposed to happen

1283
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,870
actually happened I was like chef are

1284
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:48,060
not this band like all the bands can

1285
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,950
have comebacks but not this one so the

1286
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:52,350
Kelly family came back doesn't anybody

1287
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:53,580
know the Kelly family you don't know the

1288
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:54,839
kid but that's better if you don't know

1289
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,700
don't Google the Kelly family like

1290
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,260
seriously save yourself from the travel

1291
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,629
of googling the Caliph mu do not want to

1292
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:02,580
Google that it's 2019 everything is

1293
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,900
still a thing XSS is the little thing

1294
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,400
sequel injection is still a thing

1295
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,770
cross-site scripting sister everything

1296
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,820
is still a thing and we're still here

1297
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:11,940
we're still talking about the same

1298
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:13,680
things so I don't want to kind of be

1299
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,480
overly aggressive with that but we

1300
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,790
haven't fixed a single thing straight

1301
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,400
here that's pretty epic I means good

1302
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:22,020
money so yeah let's talk about the

1303
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,190
future and now I gotta be fast because I

1304
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,580
don't have much I don't have much time

1305
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,980
left

1306
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:27,360
so as mentioned this is not stuff that I

1307
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:34,230
made up this is stuff that yes there's a

1308
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:36,030
question uh ajx ah this thing I think it

1309
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,530
was not really that important I mean

1310
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,910

1311
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:42,650

1314
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,400

1315
00:47:51,180 --> 00:48:01,410
shouldn't have mentioned italics okay we

1316

1317
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:04,980
no I was not noteworthy anyway now we're

1318
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,910
getting to the point of actually like me

1319
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:10,500
presenting

1320
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:12,629
oh we will soon but that's this is still

1321
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,140
also I did mention Bitcoin when talking

1322
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:15,140
about the ransomware

1323
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:21,549
joke's on you Freddie so now I got to

1324
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,019
talk about the future and as I said like

1325
00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:24,400
this is not stuff that I made up so you

1326
00:48:23,019 --> 00:48:26,470
can't blame me for what's on the next

1327
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,329
slides because that actually came to me

1328
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,160
in envisions and I just like summarized

1329
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:32,950
it and put it on the slides and I want

1330
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,170
to kind of present to you what my

1331
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:37,899
visions think the Internet is gonna look

1332
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:39,880
like in the next year's I don't like

1333
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,499
most of the things myself they're not

1334
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,660
funny please try not to laugh I'm not

1335
00:48:41,499 --> 00:48:46,450
trying to laugh anyway but let's look at

1336
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,920
2020 what's gonna happen so apparently I

1337
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,470
think according to the visions that I

1338
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,150
got in 2020 there's gonna be a fight

1339
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:55,450
that breaks out between the maintainer

1340
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:58,779
of CSP 4.0 and the competing standard

1341
00:48:55,450 --> 00:49:00,879
CSP next with chrome supporting CSP next

1342
00:48:58,779 --> 00:49:02,380
and Mozilla CSP 4.0 and maybe we're

1343
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,809
gonna talk about this later Freddy and

1344
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,849
we also noticed in this particular year

1345
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:08,650
that web servers now send at least 10

1346
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:11,349
different security headers per response

1347
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:13,569
which is CSP CSP next extreme options

1348
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:20,109
frame Ancestors X quantum type options

1349
00:49:13,569 --> 00:49:21,579
HSTs super 8 HDMI and j.lo chrome sets

1350
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:23,109
the same size flag for all cookies by

1351
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:24,369
default the entire internet collapses

1352
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:25,749
but it doesn't matter because they can

1353
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:28,930
just like change their code it's easy

1354
00:49:25,749 --> 00:49:30,819
and after 2 or 3 months of complete

1355
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:33,149
internet wide panic most of the WWE's

1356
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:35,288
like swore of working again and

1357
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:36,789
developers complain that there's like no

1358
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:38,410
possibilities for C surf anymore because

1359
00:49:36,789 --> 00:49:40,119
the applications needed to function and

1360
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:43,629
they replay implement it with a shim and

1361
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:45,249
it's back furthermore my visions told me

1362
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:48,039
that all the obits conferences are going

1363
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:50,049
to be canceled until 2050 to see if my

1364
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:51,279
prophecies are actually accurate and we

1365
00:49:50,049 --> 00:49:52,869
don't want to interfere with the time

1366
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:55,150
axis so we're just going to leave things

1367
00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:58,779
as they are can you confirm that or is

1368
00:49:55,150 --> 00:50:02,200
there plans well let's see and the Year

1369
00:49:58,779 --> 00:50:04,359
2022 according to the D team providing

1370
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,098
me with these insights and dreams and

1371
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:07,900
the usual size of the HTTP response

1372
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:10,750
Center is now pretty much the same as

1373
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:14,089
the HTTP body

1374
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:15,650
don't laugh it's not funny the third

1375
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:17,480
browser Wars coming to an end in google

1376
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:19,099
buys Mozilla and forces them to deplete

1377
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,930
all the traces of the gecko engine

1378
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:23,000
because why not and there is like two

1379
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:24,680
browser engines left which is blink and

1380
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,549
WebKit I think it's more than enough so

1381
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,190
that's gonna be fine

1382
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:30,349
Apple releases the iPhone 13 this has no

1383
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,089
more buttons no more apps simplicity is

1384
00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:33,680
key well Cupertino burns down and

1385
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:36,380
Android 11 reaches the market share of

1386
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,609
95 percent overnight and the chrome team

1387
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,349
announces that same site is now

1388
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:41,509
deprecated and won't have any effect

1389
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:43,430
anymore and there's again internet wide

1390
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:45,410
panic but since they had a/c surf shim

1391
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:48,290
already everything is still fine so it

1392
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:52,460
wasn't as bad as before in the cyber

1393
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:54,290
year 2023 Apple has lost their entirety

1394
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:57,020
of their phone business according to my

1395
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:58,880
visions they do an act of desperation

1396
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:01,540
and buy Google from their petty cash and

1397
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,920
forced them to delete all traces of link

1398
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:07,359
they announced the new iPhone that calls

1399
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,359
you from the inside after you swallow it

1400
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:13,430
these Phoenix is finally discontinued

1401
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:17,000
and all the efforts are no price on CSP

1402
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:18,890
5 gold Pro and meanwhile the HTTP

1403
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,420
response headers have more bytes than

1404
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:22,910
the body because why not and there's a

1405
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:25,430
set of 156 mostly overlapping and

1406
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:26,299
undocumented directives that make it

1407
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,009
quote unquote

1408
00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:31,000
easy for developers to finally do the

1409
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:33,140
right thing the EU forbids cookies

1410
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,750
websites fall back to using window name

1411
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,799
because why not

1412
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,940
majority of companies don't really care

1413
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:39,589
because they move the office to do

1414
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:42,770
Bahamas no buyer in the sand McAfee

1415
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:46,119
islands let's just the legislation is

1416
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:48,230
absolutely zero effect and only

1417
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:52,579
eliminates the small businesses which no

1418
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:54,559
one needs anyways and 2024 are things

1419
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:56,599
get much better because Mark Zuckerberg

1420
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:58,069
finally becomes the 46th President of

1421
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:00,740
the United States guess who made it in

1422
00:51:58,069 --> 00:52:02,930
2020 he says in an interview simply well

1423
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:05,959
with his burps face i have facebook that

1424
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:07,520
was easy for me and he runs facebook in

1425
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,170
parallel because now it's legal bites

1426
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,390
Apple and forces them to delete WebKit

1427
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:13,309
because too many privacy features do not

1428
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:14,509
track gets rebranded in to do now track

1429
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:17,089
and no one really notices just with

1430
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:19,010
cookies there is a group of rebellious

1431
00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:20,480
teenagers that want to kind of rebel

1432
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:22,400
against their privacy of teen parents

1433
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,289
and track ously new black and

1434
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,809
loans like this come up there's bands

1435
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:30,200
that call the tracks pistols and Edward

1436
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:31,880
with the scissor hands what the Facebook

1437
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:35,660
OS it's the market people call it PO

1438
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:37,339
tous Marc notices in suspense their

1439
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:38,690
accounts and takes the Libra so that was

1440
00:52:37,339 --> 00:52:41,390
a good idea to have this whole hero

1441
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:43,430
thing it targets all devices including

1442
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:43,788
smartwatches Amazon's Alexia's and smart

1443
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,319
socks

1444
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:46,640
smart socks you can imagine like socks

1445
00:52:45,319 --> 00:52:48,049
that kind of manage to find each other

1446
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,270
overnight so they keep like crawling

1447
00:52:48,049 --> 00:52:51,829
through the flat and use geolocation and

1448
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:53,660
then you have them together you put them

1449
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:57,349
in the washing machine and it's six

1450
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:58,299
types of Europeans so that was pretty

1451
00:52:57,349 --> 00:53:01,490
good

1452
00:52:58,299 --> 00:53:03,230
2025 it gets really exciting the movie

1453
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:04,700
Fight Club to finally hits box office

1454
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:06,500
with Tyler Durden and an aging Miley

1455
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,980
Cyrus joining forces and they delete

1456
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:11,059
Facebook's like database civilization

1457
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,829
accordingly crumbles a new civilization

1458
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:14,359
arises from the ruins builds a yikes

1459
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:16,670
database and paving the way for the

1460
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:18,230
sequel 5-cup 3 I watched the first one

1461
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:20,029
I'm not going to watch this one the

1462
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:21,230
visions were enough browsers as such

1463
00:53:20,029 --> 00:53:23,690
don't really exist anymore the whole

1464
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:24,920
system is now the browser and replaces

1465
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,089
the operating system as we know because

1466
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,279
the browser can do absolutely everything

1467
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:29,390
and runs directly on the hardware and

1468
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:30,440
there's not really the need for the

1469
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:31,759
operating system anymore because

1470
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,859
everything is done by the browser in the

1471
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,940
first place let me store vaults some of

1472
00:53:33,859 --> 00:53:36,410
you might not miss the maintainer of the

1473
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:38,000
Linux kernel he's like really happy

1474
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:39,589
about that change he really likes that

1475
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,809
and changes directions for the Linux

1476
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:43,788
kernel itself which is now a closed

1477
00:53:41,809 --> 00:53:45,650
source browser extension as the

1478
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:47,420
browser's and us with in-app purchases

1479
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:49,029
and really funny but annoying pay to win

1480
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:51,559
games

1481
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:53,599
CSP 6 comes out and it raises all

1482
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:55,400
browser security problems with just one

1483
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,690
header but the user turing-complete mini

1484
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,430
language called header is cryptic I

1485
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:59,690
literally can't wait for that that was

1486
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:04,629
one of the visions where I woke up and

1487
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:07,549
was like really sweating is like yes so

1488
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:10,670
we're moving in a fast pace it's 2028

1489
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:11,960
and Adobe Flash respect yes we just

1490
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:15,039
still have one of these by the way if

1491
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,039
somebody wants to say something about

1492
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:26,740
yes that was blunt Pavelec here we go

1493
00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:28,900
and the much-beloved software is now

1494
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:30,790
rent read directly running in the

1495
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:32,560
operating system aka browser kernel and

1496
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:33,820
has access to all hardware for just like

1497
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,099
much better video performance and user

1498
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,630
experience and since the dhobi was aware

1499
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:39,580
that there was security problems in the

1500
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:41,260
past just one maybe two the hare the

1501
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:44,619
WordPress team has invited experts to

1502
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,609
take care of that just my visions just

1503
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:47,410
add it's not my fault

1504
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:49,390
what WG recommends to just forget about

1505
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:51,970
the HTTP response body like just like

1506
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:55,270
and just like just use headers I mean

1507
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:58,390
come on geez like any was many legacies

1508
00:54:55,270 --> 00:55:00,070
profit jQuery releases their own header

1509
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:01,720
only version that is like a couple of

1510
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,980
folded HTTP headers that make up for

1511
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,529
three megabytes and it's like even

1512
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:07,540
faster than before and oh it's not

1513
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:10,119
running any conferences anymore which is

1514
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:12,880
a shame NIMH releases finally their new

1515
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:14,800
masterpiece which is the OS Internet

1516
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,930
suite with the integrated August IDE

1517
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,820
that allows you to build applications

1518
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:21,279
that are super secure with our script

1519
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,750
and they also release the oboz browser

1520
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,070
which is super secure which is running

1521
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:28,390
next to the whole thing on the operating

1522
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:29,980
systems called outer I was a success but

1523
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:43,868
people complain that the wiki is not

1524
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:45,400
that up-to-date twenty thirty most of if

1525
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:47,050
not all it's got to be really bad now

1526
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,430
like like my visuals were really blurry

1527
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:50,230
but I try to make the best other than

1528
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:52,868
most if not all personal computers are

1529
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:54,730
actually wearables or like clippable so

1530
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:56,380
you can attach them to your body and

1531
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:57,760
they talk to the body bus and then they

1532
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:59,800
actually kind of interfere with your

1533
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,240
brains directly and across that

1534
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,400
scripting war breaks out the target

1535
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,629
assaults features and it turns out that

1536
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,010
they still haven't unimplemented the

1537
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:07,540
alert function and the alert function

1538
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:09,160
actually gives you like a small electric

1539
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,869
shock and it does exactly that then it

1540
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,779
takes a picture of your confused face

1541
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:16,119
adds the image marker derp and puts it

1542
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:17,770
on some server and then threatens the

1543
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:20,410
victim to kind of release it unless they

1544
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:22,660
pay 500 selfie coin which is almost as

1545
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:24,670
much as 12 jewel coins seventeen theorem

1546
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:26,649
or five cyber chrono light Freddy there

1547
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:29,809
you go with your currencies

1548
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:32,989
every industry reacts with a new F and

1549
00:56:29,809 --> 00:56:34,400
called selfie secure they attempt to

1550
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:36,619
stop the outbreak and they have used

1551
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,910
success the warm author's get caught

1552
00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:39,349
when the rest didn't they get thrown

1553
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:41,239
into something that is known as cyber

1554
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:42,859
jail in the future where you have to

1555
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:44,719
work on a very large office document on

1556
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:47,150
a Windows 7 machine with 4 gigabytes of

1557
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:50,420
RAM and you have only 15 years to finish

1558
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:50,839
the document activists say this is

1559
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,479
torture

1560
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:56,749
and very uncool but they get ignored

1561
00:56:53,479 --> 00:57:00,019
over overloads and 2031 things get much

1562
00:56:56,749 --> 00:57:01,308
darker always corporation buys Netflix I

1563
00:57:00,019 --> 00:57:03,589
don't know why they change all the

1564
00:57:01,309 --> 00:57:05,660
programming do we have security related

1565
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:08,599
and web security education and

1566
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:10,189
re-education related but roughly 99.5%

1567
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:12,920
of the viewers don't really like that

1568
00:57:10,189 --> 00:57:14,569
and the stock just planets like what

1569
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:18,259
were you doing what are you going to be

1570
00:57:14,569 --> 00:57:19,788
doing prompt is a new alert is this a

1571
00:57:18,259 --> 00:57:22,160
show that they kind of tried to release

1572
00:57:19,789 --> 00:57:23,059
to get more people be interested in web

1573
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,449
security flops

1574
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:28,579
and it just didn't work out as expected

1575
00:57:26,449 --> 00:57:30,559
inspired by the organization Mothers

1576
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:32,539
Against kiss the organization fathers

1577
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,069
against SSL gets founded who basically

1578
00:57:32,539 --> 00:57:36,799
states our kids have nothing to hide so

1579
00:57:34,069 --> 00:57:39,288
use plain text communications port 80 is

1580
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:41,150
receiving a well deserved Renaissance

1581
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:43,039
but later it turns out that it was a

1582
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:44,959
false flag operation from intelligence

1583
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:47,719
agencies who just kind of try to tempt

1584
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:53,239
people to use less crypto and it worked

1585
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:56,509
in the year 2035 the new EU of the EU

1586
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:58,219
two of the new new bribery salaries in

1587
00:57:56,509 --> 00:58:00,439
general I think it's a great thing I

1588
00:57:58,219 --> 00:58:02,329
went to some conferences I got selfie

1589
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:03,769
poisoning so of course for security and

1590
00:58:02,329 --> 00:58:05,509
privacy reasons are to correct the

1591
00:58:03,769 --> 00:58:06,890
populace on this however leads some of

1592
00:58:05,509 --> 00:58:09,319
the member states including New India

1593
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:11,449
Italy and saxonia to immediately leave

1594
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:13,969
the Union and become countries on their

1595
00:58:11,449 --> 00:58:15,709
own again short after the selfie secure

1596
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:18,019
sorry every industry service get

1597
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:19,279
breached and a total number of 2.5

1598
00:58:18,019 --> 00:58:21,258
billion selfies with the short

1599
00:58:19,279 --> 00:58:22,489
expression get leaked over the breach

1600
00:58:21,259 --> 00:58:25,969
management platform that is called

1601
00:58:22,489 --> 00:58:27,589
pastebin and first the selfie secure

1602
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:29,239
server maintainer state there was just a

1603
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:31,099
few billion selfies and then a few more

1604
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:32,539
billion selfies and then absolutely all

1605
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:35,179
the selfies have been compromised

1606
00:58:32,539 --> 00:58:36,859
it's a shame new advertising technology

1607
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,849
comes others called ethical x' and the

1608
00:58:36,859 --> 00:58:39,469
louse

1609
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:40,969
with this I don't know whether they how

1610
00:58:39,469 --> 00:58:43,400
they but it comes out and it kind of

1611
00:58:40,969 --> 00:58:45,589
allows people to project a laser

1612
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,449
controlled imagery directly on the iris

1613
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:48,890
and you can't escape the ads anymore

1614
00:58:47,449 --> 00:58:50,539
which is a great thing for the industry

1615
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:53,949
and it's much appreciated by the

1616
00:58:50,539 --> 00:58:57,140
industry leaders and in 2039 were often

1617
00:58:53,949 --> 00:58:58,670
mark zuckerberg 36 actually sorry Mac

1618
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:00,799
zuckerberg finally gets challenged and

1619
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:04,160
loses his presidency because an AI

1620
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:06,949
actually takes over and the AIAS a eyes

1621
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,660
do or are known to do basically looks at

1622
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:11,119
the way of getting the most votes which

1623
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:13,009
is having claims and slogans like int

1624
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,839
now kittens let's play a game

1625
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:16,489
destroy all humans but using a chipmunk

1626
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:19,430
voice Oh everybody loves it and votes it

1627
00:59:16,489 --> 00:59:21,410
up and the eye becomes president he

1628
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:23,448
steps all down from all positions of

1629
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:26,180
Facebook a couple of technologists from

1630
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:27,799
the where wge seek to bring the glory of

1631
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:30,198
the old days back they find the cd-rom

1632
00:59:27,799 --> 00:59:31,969
in some dusty cellar and it contains a

1633
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:34,699
version of the long-lost WebKit engine

1634
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:38,539
and they finally after 38 years managed

1635
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:40,789
to release version 3.1 of mosaic people

1636
00:59:38,539 --> 00:59:42,799
call it ironic retro browsing and it's

1637
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:44,119
very very hip but over time it's turns

1638
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:45,619
out to be so awesome that they just

1639
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:48,019
leave away the ironic and the retro and

1640
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:50,719
just call it browsing in the year 2040

1641
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:51,738
the popular curve this place that you

1642
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:52,999
all have you on your desk right now

1643
00:59:51,739 --> 00:59:54,109
which kind of released like the pain

1644
00:59:52,999 --> 00:59:56,180
from your eyes when you work for ten

1645
00:59:54,109 --> 00:59:57,979
hours and more actually get a curve that

1646
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:59,448
is 360 degrees and people just don't

1647
00:59:57,979 --> 01:00:00,799
leave the tvs anymore because that

1648
00:59:59,449 --> 01:00:03,380
becomes the center of their life or they

1649
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:05,690
become the center of the TV ads are

1650
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,920
getting directed pretty much injected

1651
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:09,829
directly into the bloodstream which are

1652
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:12,369
scary and they just this desire to the

1653
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:15,199
need to buy whatever is being advertised

1654
01:00:12,369 --> 01:00:17,390
some less ethical advertisers actually

1655
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:20,299
choose to kind of also omit the alcohol

1656
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:24,920
molecule and they claim the slogan you

1657
01:00:20,299 --> 01:00:27,109
hi you buy that three wide and it turns

1658
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:29,479
out that they can't be avoided by face

1659
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:31,098
boss anymore and even modified selfies

1660
01:00:29,479 --> 01:00:32,689
secure binaries can't take it because

1661
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:34,279
they just like attack the brain directly

1662
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:36,319
the industry was seeking for new

1663
01:00:34,279 --> 01:00:37,390
solutions by his random startups on mass

1664
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:40,069
with great success

1665
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:42,259
however a group of students is supposed

1666
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:44,058
to develop a new ad blocker and it's

1667
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:46,009
called you block it gets directly into

1668
01:00:44,059 --> 01:00:47,599
the bloodstream as well and blocks the

1669
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:49,910
ads right at the synapse level which is

1670
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:51,310
great it also blocks bad tickles which

1671
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:53,080
are modified ethical

1672
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:54,820
triggered the desired percent Bitcoin

1673
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:59,290
here we are again to arbitrary as well

1674
01:00:54,820 --> 01:01:01,570
and so on you finally reach the the

1675
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:04,900
glory full year 2050 and I'm really over

1676
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:07,150
time and as promised and as my

1677
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:08,700
prophecies and visions told me on global

1678
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:10,930
OPSEC and all the conferences come back

1679
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:13,299
people are very confused what this all

1680
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:14,919
is they don't know the idea of a

1681
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,540
conference visit anymore but they really

1682
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:19,450
love the huge sickles we're at signals

1683
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:22,540
with alcohol and some still wonder where

1684
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:24,129
the cpe credits have gone an older very

1685
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:25,540
old version of me is being brought up to

1686
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:26,950
stage there's gonna be a cross-check

1687
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:28,150
which ones of the prophecies actually

1688
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:30,640
came true turns out all of them

1689
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:32,680
especially the weird ones and there's

1690
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:35,020
never-ending applause and I get handed

1691
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:37,419
over the global cookie jar keys and

1692
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:41,850
lordship and that's it all my material

1693
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:41,850
fiction British people have like this
