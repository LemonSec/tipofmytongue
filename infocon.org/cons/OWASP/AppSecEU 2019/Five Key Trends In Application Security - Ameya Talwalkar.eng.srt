1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:10,350
thank you everybody for coming for the

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,600
stock given the time this at the end of

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,940
this long conference I thought this will

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,849
turn into a one-on-one or one two maybe

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,849
two or three conversation but happy to

6
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:23,519
see so many of you show up and attend

7
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:27,990
the talk so thank you what I thought

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:31,049
I'll do today is keep it more of a

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,960
storytelling session I've been working

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,750
with many security practitioners in

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,360
small medium large enterprises over the

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,920
last five plus years and and helping

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,470
them secure their applications their

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,710
applications that face the web the

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:49,290
internet applications so this is all

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,810
about their struggles that I've observed

17
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,220
in the last five years some of the

18
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,250
trends that are going on in the industry

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:01:00,060
that are creating new challenges for

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,160
existing stable security environments so

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,589
hopefully some of this is it's going to

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,649
resonate with some of you I'm happy to

23
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:10,140
hear feedback if anything is you know

24
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:12,179
not what you see or what you experience

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,979
so keep it keep it an interactive

26
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:19,350
session and see how it goes a quick

27
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,670
introduction my name is Amaya Thoreau

28
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,669
Volker I'm the co-founder and chief

29
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,710
product officer at sequence security we

30
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,469
are providing application security

31
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,630
platform which does bought mitigation as

32
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,939
well as threat mitigation or you know

33
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,639
the Louis last type of threat mitigation

34
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,460
for applications for all the mobile and

35
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:41,548
API before sequence I have my battle

36
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,499
scars are from Symantec I owned the

37
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,109
entire aisle and the malware stack at

38
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:48,270
Symantec shipped software with a click

39
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:51,658
of a button to two hundred million the

40
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:57,600
end points and that was a lot of fun and

41
00:01:51,659 --> 00:02:00,569
some prior contributions at idea so this

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,779
picture represents all the trends that

43
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:05,340
are going on this is pretty much all the

44
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:08,639
first four trends that I'm going to talk

45
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,000
about and the fifth trend is all about

46
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,640
the threats that are evolving this is a

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,240
busy slide you know but it really

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,369
all the four friends that we have going

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,770
on on the enterprise side not on the

50
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,450
thread side and at the end of the

51
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,760
presentation we have some

52
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,220
recommendations on how to deal with

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,820
these strands and are these are these

54
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:37,410
best practices suitable for you so let's

55
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:41,730
jump right into it the first trend is a

56
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:45,329
journey to the cloud not something new

57
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:48,060
pretty much everybody here must have had

58
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,850
some experience going to the cloud what

59
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,760
we find is enterprises are in various

60
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,980
stages of their journey to the cloud if

61
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,160
you are an environment where you are

62
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,679
purely deployed in either a cloud

63
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,530
environment or purely deployed in a

64
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,060
physical data center congratulations you

65
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,840
are lucky you don't have to worry about

66
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:13,020
a lot of things here but what we find is

67
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,020
most most enterprises are moving from

68
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,530
physical data centers go into a public

69
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,989
cloud and also some of them have

70
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,500
experienced the public cloud and moving

71
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,330
back to a more private cloud environment

72
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,330
so this is not necessarily running on

73
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,980
you know older stacks so the new private

74
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,220
cloud environment is running you know

75
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,530
open shift and other modern stacks all

76
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,660
the same benefits of the flexibility of

77
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,310
a public cloud but running in your own

78
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:46,579
environment where you have complete

79
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:50,070
control over it so the challenge this

80
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:53,070
creates for security practitioners is

81
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:56,370
where do you put your security where is

82
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:58,769
your perimeter right so in the old ages

83
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,019
everything was secured in layers from

84
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:04,560
the you know the outer edge all the way

85
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:07,860
to the application now the the perimeter

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,420
has shifted it can be some of it in in

87
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,640
your prime some of it is in the cloud

88
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,290
some of it is back to your private cloud

89
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:19,440
so where do you put perimeter security

90
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:21,899
some enterprises think that the answer

91
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,390
to that challenge is I'll put all my

92
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:27,570
period security or perimeter security at

93
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,340
the CDN layer because most of these and

94
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:33,480
prices most of these applications are

95
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:36,659
running behind CDN and CDLs today offer

96
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:40,860
a variety of security solutions laughs

97
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:44,190
what mitigation and few others so the

98
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:48,030
answer could be that your security is

99
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:51,240
now living with the CDN vendor that

100
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,820
brings us to our second challenge which

101
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,120
is people are now using multiple

102
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,909
salience and how this happens is there

103
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,930
are many many different reasons for it

104
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:06,930
we have worked with a small social media

105
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,690
company that has three different CDN

106
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:12,630
vendors they choose it because one

107
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,969
vendor is particularly good at serving

108
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,040
static content images and things like

109
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:20,550
that and the other vendor is good at

110
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,490
dynamic content there is some push

111
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,650
around you know edge computing where the

112
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:29,490
Syrians are doing a lot of dynamic

113
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,919
content generation at the edge it could

114
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,650
be as simple as acquisitions people

115
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,600
acquire companies the acquiring

116
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,900
companies have established relationships

117
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,970
with CD ends sometimes the security is

118
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,859
already there so they don't want to rock

119
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:49,500
the boat therefore you end up with

120
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:52,470
multiple Syrians we have lived with at

121
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,800
least one of our customer who during our

122
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,860
deployment has moved from one CDN vendor

123
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,420
to another CDN matter and just imagine

124
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,910
the pain you have to go through when you

125
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:06,990
have all your vassals all your security

126
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:09,420
put in one one CDN and now have to

127
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,960
transfer all of that into a completely

128
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:16,260
new CDN it has it was very painful

129
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,870
based on our experience so yeah so the

130
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,690
parameter which you know could have been

131
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:28,990
the CDN has now again shifted to

132
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:32,590
becoming multiple Syrians if you manage

133
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:35,800
I think the third trend is around just

134
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:39,159
the proliferation of api's right so

135
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,610
previous older monolith applications are

136
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,139
now broken into multiple api's and what

137
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,210
really used to happen is you had the

138
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:49,060
monolith and then the front end of the

139
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:51,609
apt used to talk to multiple back-end

140
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,759
services those services are now breaking

141
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:57,190
into various micro services and some of

142
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,940
them are directly accessible from the

143
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:03,910
outside so all your vassals and and

144
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,430
other security tooling that you did for

145
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,680
just a few apps that were accessible

146
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,020
from outside now that needs to be

147
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,970
replicated for all the hundreds of micro

148
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,389
services that are directly communicating

149
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:19,509
with mobile apps with your partners with

150
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:23,770
your suppliers what what it whatever it

151
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:26,759
may be so your security surface or your

152
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:31,198
attack surface as a whole has certainly

153
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,199
increased tremendously because of this

154
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,990
the next trend is is compliance and this

155
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:45,969
is no big surprise here in Europe the

156
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:48,909
GDP are and in in over in the u.s. we

157
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:51,759
have CCPA which is California a consumer

158
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:54,610
protection act which is some say it's

159
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,620
even stricter than GDP are the challenge

160
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:00,250
with this is if you choose a security

161
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:03,550
vendor that depends on looking at

162
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:05,409
sensitive data it is taking traffic

163
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,289
either out of your environment for

164
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:11,740
security for inspection

165
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:14,919
you are now worried about is that vendor

166
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,810
causing my GDP our compliance at risk is

167
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:21,159
that when they're going to cause me CCPA

168
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:24,070
problems right so handing over security

169
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:27,219
to a third-party vendor that does magic

170
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,680
in their cloud is all great but it

171
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:31,810
brings another challenge about the

172
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,969
compliance the law of the land and and

173
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,490
where is my data residing right so you

174
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:38,650
have not only the consumer privacy

175
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,560
concerns but you have to make sure that

176
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,880
your your consumer data stays in the in

177
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:45,130
the geolocation

178
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,040
the consumer comes from and that can be

179
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,139
a huge challenge if you if you use

180
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,439
something that is you know taking your

181
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:59,589
data out into their private cloud and

182
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:03,069
securing it so these are the four trends

183
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:05,920
that are that are that are related to

184
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:09,819
the enterprises the fifth trend is about

185
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,979
the attack surface there is very little

186
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:15,219
talk at this conference about in general

187
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,350
the automated threats but but based on

188
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,769
our observation we think this is the the

189
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:23,620
fastest-growing attack surface for

190
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:25,420
applications and this is about bore

191
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,050
attacks this is about automated threats

192
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:31,959
they come in various different formats

193
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,719
or all types Oh ass actually has a

194
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:38,699
complete different category dedicated to

195
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:42,639
it under the automated threats category

196
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:47,979
but this can be this can lead to many

197
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:51,040
many losses you start with almost every

198
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:54,480
single industry suffers from credential

199
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:58,959
stuffing account takeover problem

200
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:02,139
similarly fake account creation I just

201
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,779
read that Facebook deleted about about

202
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:08,079
three billion fake accounts recently

203
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:10,509
LinkedIn recently deleted about half a

204
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,300
billion fake accounts and these fake

205
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:15,610
accounts are just a launching pad to a

206
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:20,639
lot of bad things that happen we have

207
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:23,339
behind that if you are a retail vendor

208
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,259
they then you're suffering from scraping

209
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:28,720
it could be simple things like price or

210
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:32,610
in rent escaping it could be as severe

211
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,259
as the case of uber versus lift where

212
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:38,410
the help program that was developed by

213
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:43,769
uber was impersonating drivers or

214
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:46,509
customers of lift and you know scraping

215
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:49,769
fair information it was also scraping

216
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:54,790
driver information so it can lead to

217
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:59,600
severe business impact including

218
00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:03,410
you know loss of IP and an IP theft if

219
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,380
you are retail customers enterprises

220
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:08,750
then then you you could be subject to

221
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,990
automated shopping you could be subject

222
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:14,980
to locking your inventory which is

223
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:18,410
inventoried in a love attack so

224
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:21,890
depending on who you are the airline

225
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:25,339
industry and hotel industry suffers from

226
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:28,280
seat sparing and and hotel reservation

227
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,970
scams things of that nature so this is

228
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:36,079
this is just escalating this very rarely

229
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:38,510
makes the newspapers if you if you if

230
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,700
you suffer from the top ten categories

231
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,280
and then it leads to some other breach

232
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,260
and it's going to make newspaper these

233
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,930
attacks actually hit your bottom line

234
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,240
this hits you with your profit this hits

235
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,910
you with the fraud losses that are there

236
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,650
that are enormous and most often they

237
00:11:52,910 --> 00:12:00,170
don't make the newspapers so a few

238
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:02,060
components that are that I covered here

239
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,579
on the left hand side I forgot to

240
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,979
mention them but really what what is

241
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,560
behind these attacks are different for

242
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,600
different components which is just the

243
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,930
ease of available credentials in the

244
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,820
market the different infrastructure that

245
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,819
is easily available for end to the

246
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:23,210
attackers the different tools that are

247
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,400
easily available and again the different

248
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:28,820
behavior patterns that they can choose

249
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,699
from these tools so the first is

250
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,880
credentials there there is an estimate

251
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:37,040
about 14 billion ton credentials are

252
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,270
leaked in the underground and they keep

253
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:45,020
going up every single day these are some

254
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:46,730
of the the recent breaches that have

255
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:51,410
contributed to these 14 billion

256
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:53,330
credentials I don't even see some of the

257
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:58,040
older ones that used to be very popular

258
00:12:53,330 --> 00:13:00,320
but last year alone it was close to 11

259
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,050
or 12 billion so every year it keeps

260
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,390
going higher and higher I am pretty sure

261
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,930
all of us have at some point received an

262
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:09,029
email from

263
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,368
company saying your your credentials

264
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:13,559
were detected as compromised we need to

265
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:15,329
reset your password and what that

266
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:19,399
happens is those credentials are now

267
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:19,399
being tried on many many different sites

268
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:25,199
the industry works very efficiently as

269
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:27,959
soon as certain credentials are

270
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:30,479
validated you immediately see them

271
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,790
posting on different forums they are

272
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,800
sold from anywhere from few cents per

273
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:39,480
credential to a few dollars in certain

274
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:43,469
cases yeah the industry is extremely

275
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:48,629
efficient in in in in networking and

276
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:52,230
sharing the these credentials the next

277
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:54,029
next is tools the tools are getting

278
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,420
better and better I just have one

279
00:13:54,029 --> 00:14:00,480
screenshot from the most popular tool in

280
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:04,709
this in this space this is Center MBA

281
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,889
you have plenty of videos of this tool

282
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:10,170
on YouTube you will find that people are

283
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:13,050
now skinning this so that there is a

284
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:15,719
version of sentry available just for

285
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:18,059
certain sites I don't want to take any

286
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:22,050
names but there are several YouTube

287
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:25,370
channels that are showing you this user

288
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:28,109
interface for attacking certain sites

289
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:30,209
they also sell configuration that goes

290
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:35,839
along with it so this is extremely

291
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:38,638
customizable per site or per application

292
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:42,779
these configurations sell for anywhere

293
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:46,379
from $5 to even $500 in some cases in

294
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:48,870
the black market there are others like

295
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:52,980
hitman and sniper and many others that

296
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:56,339
are coming up but the real good ones are

297
00:14:52,980 --> 00:15:00,290
you know custom developed attack tools

298
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,290
that are targeting certain applications

299
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:08,758
and now come to behavior which is how do

300
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:11,628
they behave or with the applications to

301
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:14,369
how much effort it takes for them to

302
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:17,579
behave like real human beings so that

303
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:19,540
you know the obvious at detection tools

304
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:23,680
or protection tools are not able

305
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:27,120
detect them but it also gives them

306
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,430
tremendous flexibility in in customizing

307
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,589
their behavior in the sense that this is

308
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,560
one of the sites that's allowing you to

309
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:41,199
select the bots that you want to run on

310
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:44,199
Nike just Google search for Nike bot you

311
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,319
will see at least a few hundred hits on

312
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:50,170
github of various different Nike boards

313
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:54,040
and all they're doing is when Nike comes

314
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,560
out with a special edition shoe they're

315
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,029
gonna use one of these BOTS and

316
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,369
completely take or you know suck the

317
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:03,699
inventory out and sell it in various

318
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:07,149
different secondary markets for 3x or 5x

319
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:09,758
the price that Nike is selling for why

320
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,470
Nike cares about this and I don't

321
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,290
pretend to be their spokesperson but

322
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,819
I've had some interactions is they care

323
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,769
about user experience they want to make

324
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:21,370
sure that real users are able to buy

325
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:23,860
their products at the right price and so

326
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:27,430
this is a big big big problem not just

327
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:30,519
for Nike but but similar companies but

328
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:34,089
you can see in this case there is a lot

329
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:36,430
of competition going on for selling

330
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:42,910
their bot to the attackers right there

331
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:45,099
are so many versions of them the next is

332
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:48,550
cyber criminal infrastructure and this

333
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:52,690
is a fascinating area of interest we

334
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:55,389
just published a research on on this

335
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:57,310
thing called bulletproof proxies you can

336
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,199
you can get the URL here and download it

337
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:03,699
or if you want to stop by in the in our

338
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:06,459
booth you can get get a copy of it this

339
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:09,188
is you know when we actually published a

340
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:12,040
report within a week or two I think even

341
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:14,470
Brian Kurt started talking about it we

342
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:17,438
are now collaborating with him on on the

343
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:22,120
the next stage of the research but what

344
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:25,750
this is is around using residential

345
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:28,389
networks or residential IP addresses or

346
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:31,690
in some cases some unused IP space in

347
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:33,430
the hosting providers to completely

348
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:37,120
defeat your geofencing

349
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:41,430
and the workflow that we have identified

350
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:44,379
and available for people to go through

351
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:46,600
acquiring these IP addresses is also

352
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,630
very fascinating you can see that you

353
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,449
can choose you know either a residential

354
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:57,520
proxy network or you can choose a you

355
00:17:52,450 --> 00:18:00,970
know unused IP space and in the ISP or

356
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,250
some hosting providers one of the key

357
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:10,930
things that it does not only defeats the

358
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:13,450
geofencing but it is also able to the

359
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:17,920
the the max minds of the world right the

360
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:19,240
geo geo IP database is completely missed

361
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,400
this they think that this is a

362
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,560
legitimate ib coming from a legitimate

363
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,980
country whereas the actual IP is owned

364
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:29,710
somewhere else so all of those details

365
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,570
are in the report happy to share some

366
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:36,520
details with you offline or give you a

367
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:39,010
copy I was just talking to a to an

368
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,410
enterprise on Wednesday in London and

369
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:44,230
they are purely Bob blocking the bots

370
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:47,230
leaving IP addresses and what they worry

371
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:50,290
about is if I block you know Bart attack

372
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,850
using IPS because of bulletproof proxies

373
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:55,960
I might be actually blocking a real

374
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:58,270
customer because these these IPS are you

375
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,800
know shared between real users and at

376
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,470
the same time their home routers are

377
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,720
compromised their cameras are

378
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,480
compromised or they they might have some

379
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:12,760
other IOT devices that are completely

380
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:16,540
compromised this is the Geo distribution

381
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:20,800
of these these these bulletproof proxies

382
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:24,430
it is very prevalent in pretty much all

383
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:28,629
the geographies so no particular region

384
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:30,670
is immune to this we thought initially

385
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,700
this was a problem mostly in the in the

386
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,180
Western world but it's not the case at

387
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:39,990
all

388
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:45,419
and they are using IPS from dominant

389
00:19:39,990 --> 00:20:03,690
local either telco or residential ISPs

390
00:19:45,419 --> 00:20:06,779
- - to make it look like yes the reason

391
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:10,349
for going after the the most the top

392
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:13,440
tier is bees is that enterprises are

393
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:16,499
that much risk aware risk covers to

394
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,570
block IP is coming from conquer so if

395
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:21,869
I'm a for now if I'm an American

396
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:25,739
Enterprise I know most of my you know

397
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:29,488
end users are Comcast or you know AT&T

398
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:32,309
customers so I'll be very scared to

399
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:38,179
block an IP from from Comcast and that's

400
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:41,099
the reason why they go after these and

401
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:43,049
there is a war going on in this industry

402
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:46,908
there are at least we are tracking two

403
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:49,918
different underground gangs if you will

404
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:52,769
that are competing for for their

405
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,089
services so if you go into an

406
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:57,209
underground we have some pictures and

407
00:20:54,089 --> 00:21:02,070
stuff in the report where they will be

408
00:20:57,209 --> 00:21:04,499
one one one one outfit has I think 10

409
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,450
million IP Stu to to rent and the other

410
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:08,849
one has 30 and they you know they keep

411
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:11,099
fighting each other with with different

412
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:21,918
pricing and whatnot it's it's a real

413
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:28,589
operation and some other sites around is

414
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:31,169
again fascinating that most of these IP

415
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:34,469
seem to be attacking mobile apps not a

416
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:37,019
whole lot of web app again I can't point

417
00:21:34,469 --> 00:21:38,940
out why but this is just the data that

418
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,999
that we are able to collect and some

419
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,009
some of the sources are you know places

420
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:51,839
like Akamai they they also say the same

421
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:54,539
thing so let's get into you know some of

422
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,658
the attack examples I have only a few of

423
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:58,980
them to share the first one is account

424
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:01,590
takeover I think there was

425
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,390
talk about credential stuffing in the

426
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:07,110
previous slot so I don't want to go too

427
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:10,049
deep into it but this is really the

428
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:12,479
first step you you get you know these 14

429
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:14,400
billion credentials you try you know a

430
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,280
few million at a time and if your

431
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,520
success rate is anywhere from 0.1% to

432
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,940
0.5% you have a wealth of credentials to

433
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,668
to use them for for various purposes the

434
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,700
next set of activities that happen once

435
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:31,309
these credentials are validated can can

436
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,000
cause a lot of harm right whether it's

437
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,270
transferring money from your account

438
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,280
whether if you're a financial Institute

439
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:44,549
whether it's creating if you are in the

440
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:46,860
social media space then they go after

441
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:49,139
this thing called romance scam which is

442
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:51,360
the current generation version of the

443
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,330
nigerian prince where they send you

444
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,299
messages to your you know social

445
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:59,399
contacts about somebody's sake i need to

446
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:02,309
you know some money can you wire it you

447
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,809
know things of that nature so this once

448
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:06,450
the accounts are compromised there is a

449
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:09,120
lot of damage that comes behind it the

450
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:10,710
point i want to make here is that you

451
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,889
were worried about web and mobile apps

452
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:16,980
before but in more and more cases the

453
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:19,590
api's are also equally you know

454
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,990
vulnerable because more and more

455
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,600
applications are or enterprises are

456
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:26,730
directly exposing their api's to the

457
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,770
internet so if you have protection on

458
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,320
the web if you have protection on the

459
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:33,210
mobile side watch out for those api is

460
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,610
because the attackers are not going to

461
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:37,140
go after the biggest or with the biggest

462
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:44,639
lock they're going to find a door that

463
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:46,740
has has no lock on it the second one is

464
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,700
fake account creation which is we

465
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:53,000
touched upon it a little bit many

466
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,429
different things can can come after

467
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,460
people creating fake accounts including

468
00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:01,919
the romance scam example i said but it

469
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,380
also includes things like automated

470
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,169
shopping things like you know denial of

471
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,830
inventory the denial inventory is

472
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:13,190
interesting we saw a case last year in

473
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:16,279
and in the US where a company made a

474
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:19,249
political statement or a took a

475
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:21,440
political position and somebody was

476
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:24,230
completely upset with that company for

477
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:28,129
taking that political stance and a kid

478
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:31,190
wrote a script and routed the the the

479
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:34,248
attack to all the residential proxies to

480
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:36,649
lock down that company's inventory at a

481
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:39,889
large retailer right so this retail it

482
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:42,709
is is a three billion per year retailer

483
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:44,988
is a large retail company could not sell

484
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,820
one of the top brands they sell for

485
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:48,769
three days because of the fake accounts

486
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,689
being created and the inventory being

487
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:59,450
locked in those fake accounts in the

488
00:24:50,690 --> 00:25:03,139
shopping carts for three days so next is

489
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:05,960
content scraping I think this is this is

490
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:09,408
interesting I talked a little bit about

491
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:13,639
the uber versus lift another example is

492
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:18,590
is in the social space we you know a

493
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:22,100
video sharing social network around the

494
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:24,439
video sharing you know experience and

495
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,330
all of their IP is embedded in the

496
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,820
videos that users create and upload on

497
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:33,289
their site and and one of their

498
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:37,220
competitor was actually creating fake

499
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:40,639
accounts going after the the most liked

500
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,350
users and pulling down their their their

501
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:44,899
videos because they were able to then

502
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:47,959
decode those songs and and steal the IP

503
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:50,840
from from those songs so this is where

504
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,879
you know this is not just about you know

505
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,350
simple economics this is a existential

506
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:58,519
threat to that company because the

507
00:25:54,350 --> 00:26:02,658
competition is creeping their IP using

508
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:07,659
BOTS other examples are retailers suffer

509
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:10,100
a lot because of very highly competitive

510
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:12,440
nature competitive nature of their

511
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,939
pricing strategy so if you have a sale

512
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,009
going on in one retailer the other

513
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,409
retailer wants to know what's your

514
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:21,970
pricing how much inventory you have to

515
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:24,070
go you know and go below your pricing or

516
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:28,840
and figure out the inventory strategies

517
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:35,320
around that so of all the things that we

518
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:40,209
we talked about scraping actually leads

519
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,990
to another problem which is cost of

520
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:45,520
doing business

521
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:49,090
I mean if 50 percent of your traffic in

522
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:52,480
the net price is scraping just imagine

523
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:54,879
the cost that you're paying to serve all

524
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,060
the bots all the way to the application

525
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,430
tier right so you're over provisioning

526
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:03,610
your your servers your hardware or your

527
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:05,650
easiest easy two instances you're paying

528
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:08,590
too much for the bandwidth to either

529
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:11,170
your service provider or or again to to

530
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:13,649
your to a cloud provider and those

531
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,580
network costs especially can be can be

532
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:19,000
huge

533
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:23,560
so not just scraping but other types of

534
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,710
bar attacks also lead to you guys our

535
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,750
enterprise is losing money because you

536
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:35,080
are completely over provisioning your

537
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:38,970
your your infrastructure I don't have

538
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:43,510
many other examples I wish I did but I

539
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:46,690
want to come to some of these

540
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:49,350
recommendations to address these

541
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:52,240
problems right so number one is

542
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:54,250
application security consider something

543
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,410
that you know can secure the application

544
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,360
wherever it goes whether it's in in a

545
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,830
physical data center whether it's in the

546
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,199
public cloud or whether it's in the

547
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:04,960
private cloud right and if you have all

548
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,510
three of them think think about how can

549
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,760
you best secure these applications where

550
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:13,420
the security solution is able to move

551
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:16,060
along with the application the second is

552
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:20,020
look for vendors or solutions that will

553
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:22,919
not you know breach the the compliance

554
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:25,750
requirements in various geographies

555
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,820
challenges around you know sending your

556
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:30,930
traffic completely to a private cloud

557
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:35,678
and and and and relying on them to

558
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:37,720
comply with with gdpr or CCPA

559
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,610
just double-check that that they are

560
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:44,049
able to provide you with the proof that

561
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:47,139
they are there following the laws the

562
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:48,879
third one is security needs to keep with

563
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:51,490
the development and this is a problem of

564
00:28:48,879 --> 00:28:52,360
you know deficit cops has to be as fast

565
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,509
as DevOps

566
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,399
a lot of times we find that DevOps is

567
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:59,200
way faster than deaf so cops and the

568
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:01,809
security people find out new

569
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,730
applications that are completely exposed

570
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:06,789
to the internet only after they are

571
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:10,090
being attacked and so solutions that

572
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:11,379
give you visibility of all the all the

573
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:15,220
applications are running in an

574
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:18,269
environment are positive the other is if

575
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,860
you if security solutions require

576
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:23,049
instrumentation or modifications to the

577
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:25,149
apps before they are published just to

578
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:27,399
secure them then your deaths a cop is

579
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:31,600
slowing down that EV ops cycle and in

580
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:33,459
this day and age that's hard to to

581
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,149
convince the business that security is

582
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:39,940
slowing down your business so look for

583
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:45,039
solutions that hopefully don't touch the

584
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:47,019
applications for security the fourth one

585
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,749
is open and extensible right

586
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:52,659
you don't want a complete black box

587
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:54,610
solution when you have an attack going

588
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:56,230
on or a campaign going on and and the

589
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,748
only thing you can do is you know call

590
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:02,100
somebody on the phone and hope that they

591
00:29:58,749 --> 00:30:05,860
solve the problem we believe in open

592
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:07,928
platforms for security you need to take

593
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,369
advantage of all the different tools

594
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:11,559
that you have in your infrastructure

595
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:14,830
whether it's a sim or an anti-fraud

596
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:19,090
solution or about mitigation solution or

597
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:20,678
a wife or a firewall why not combine all

598
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,869
the intelligence from all these

599
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:25,360
different tools to make the best

600
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:27,840
judgement because if you stop a real

601
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,549
user from from from accessing your

602
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,869
application it could be you know losing

603
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:38,100
money and on and revenue so solutions

604
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:42,189
that talk to each other can import data

605
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,600
export data work with each other you

606
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:46,210
know work with playbooks you know

607
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,129
whether through the social vendors and

608
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,260
whatnot

609
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:53,250
for those open solutions rather than

610
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:55,740
flow solutions and the last one is just

611
00:30:53,250 --> 00:31:00,000
look for solutions that are protecting

612
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:03,300
all the apps equally well the challenge

613
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,040
here is if you solve if you have a one

614
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,600
particular solution on the web a

615
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,270
different solution for mobile and

616
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:13,260
different for api's again it's gonna

617
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:15,360
slow down your dev off cycle or it's

618
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,940
going to leave applications completely

619
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,350
exposed because you don't have equal

620
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,050
protection on all of them

621
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:24,149
and no matter how much secure you make

622
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:27,629
your web or mobile applications your

623
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:29,880
api's are going to lose lose value so

624
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:32,880
these are the five recommendations for

625
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,000
the original problem statement which is

626
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,350
what's going on in your environment and

627
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:50,880
with that I will open it up for

628
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:52,050
questions you are Maya any questions if

629
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,910
so please raise your hand

630
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:58,440
oh I thought so did you really did such

631
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:01,440
a good job that no questions were but

632
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,830
there is a question I just have a

633
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,360
question about server holders service

634
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,699
fit into that space of application

635
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,070
security trends especially like

636
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,830
hardening service functions like an

637
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:15,720
azure functions or lambdas as well as

638
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,520
attacking them because I think that's a

639
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,520
big trend yes for attackers at the same

640
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,780
time yawning so what is that part of one

641
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,210
of those trends or an exit strategy

642
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:27,629
statistics is included in that you know

643
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:30,120
the this API the you know applications

644
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:32,070
being broken into micro services and the

645
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,320
micro sister services could be

646
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:37,590
completely serverless okay yeah right

647
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,270
and and again you have to find ways to

648
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:42,360
secure the surveillance applications you

649
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:43,800
need to find the right ingress wound and

650
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,479
things like that to find if you're

651
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,899
looking at perimeter security if you're

652
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,210
looking for something else you need to

653
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:53,700
think about that yeah okay are there any

654
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:57,330
specific rotations you can you can give

655
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:59,340
some about serverless functions I can I

656
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:02,510
mean let's take it offline or I can

657
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,510
write yeah thank you

658
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:09,169
so what about this digital

659
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,990
transformation many companies they want

660
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:14,390
to bring down their business settlements

661
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,340
so instead of having the manual process

662
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:19,640
they are integrating directly with their

663
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,590
api's and with the system to system now

664
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,970
the parameter totally defers correct so

665
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,370
previously I have a different parameter

666
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,350
now because of that interaction of a new

667
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,879
company which is doesn't I belong to and

668
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:31,610
I don't have any influence they

669
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,179
perimeter totally changes yeah so how do

670
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:38,030
I come up with a kind of a scope of

671
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:40,190
security program to ensure my platform

672
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,629
is safe and allow the business

673
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:44,630
functionality to spread between the

674
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:57,919
companies yeah so b2b is as I said I

675
00:33:44,630 --> 00:34:00,620
think I avoided here your you know those

676
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,929
api's are going to your partners site so

677
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:06,379
b2b is covered there you have to think

678
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:08,720
about even the partner specific

679
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:11,240
applications as you know exposed to the

680
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,699
Internet because you can't enforce just

681
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,649
Europe your partner is talking to them

682
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:18,529
you have to consider them as part of the

683
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:20,690
attack surface and look for they are

684
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:31,070
part of the parameter you can't exclude

685
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:33,139
them it doesn't it doesn't mean if you

686
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,419
provide the same functionality its

687
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:38,030
business value right to your consumers

688
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:40,250
and business partners and have all the

689
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,320
protection on the apps that are serving

690
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,780
the consumers the attackers are going to

691
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,389
find the the applications for the

692
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:54,440
partners and they'll use them so it

693
00:34:47,389 --> 00:35:00,800
can't escape that perimeter defense any

694
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:03,380
other questions yes yeah you will

695
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,740
certainly paint a very dark picture you

696
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,940
think it's a losing battle so he said is

697
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:13,009
it a losing battle

698
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:15,580
is it still I don't think it's a losing

699
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:18,619
battle it's just that

700
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:20,270
it's like every Enterprise is different

701
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:23,030
you need to think about who you are

702
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:25,520
where are your apps today where they are

703
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:28,100
going and and and look for the right

704
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,460
strategy to solve the problem I'm not

705
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,990
recommending one solution over the other

706
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:46,730
but yeah these are absolutely solvable

707
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:47,060
problems anybody else going once going

708
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:53,180
twice

709
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:55,369
okay oh well there is actually so I'm

710
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:58,970
well aware of anti automation industry

711
00:35:55,369 --> 00:36:01,220
with growing I was actually there ten

712
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:03,799
years ago in the painting try to pitch

713
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:08,118
the same things but no one would listen

714
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:12,230
is there any OS solution open-source

715
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:14,690
solutions for anti automation I mean you

716
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:18,530
talk a lot about the problems

717
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:21,530
yes the the I think the wasps if has a

718
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:24,290
twenty different list of categories

719
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:26,170
right I'm not aware of an open-source

720
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:29,900
project that that solved the problem

721
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:34,220
unfortunately not okay maybe this is the

722
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:36,140
ice to initiation all right sorry maybe

723
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,740
this is the place to initiate maybe call

724
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:46,700
for you know absolutely project yeah

725
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:48,919
okay okay if there

726
