1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,300
thanks for coming out

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,490
folks thanks for making time you could

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,709
be doing so many other things but you're

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,849
here thanks Edwin for trying you know

5
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:16,509
you did do it

6
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:18,220
my name is Daniela ryf a Grammy and I'm

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,550
here to talk to you we had to talk

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:24,310
together about secure design quite a

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,619
quality looking at the artists space and

10
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,229
looking at security usability the

11
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:31,089
challenges and the concerns I was in the

12
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,800
last session talking about culture and

13
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:35,860
all that research I know if you were in

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,239
that session talking about culture but I

15
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,149
think that some of that will play into

16
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:43,300
even what we talked about right now so

17
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:45,629
for starters a little bit above me some

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:51,339
security architect Intel Corporation and

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:54,160
the u.s. in Arizona I work on with teams

20
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:57,730
in terms of secure design for IOT mobile

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,480
applications we recently released this

22
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:03,849
book about IOT a guide to security and

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:08,830
privacy attending security and privacy

24
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:11,560
for IOT products I've being laid out OS

25
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,710
manager I'm originally from Nigeria in

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,450
West Africa and I blog there Easter on a

27
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,000
software company in the previously but

28
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,400
it's not even about me at all who cares

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,220
right blah blah blah it's not about me

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:29,140
so now let's go forward the the law is

31
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,600
really sad to say hey I'm not

32
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,130
representing Intel at first one I'm

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,640
talking for myself we're talking

34
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:38,740
together so what our learning objectives

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,570
what what are the outcomes we hope to

36
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,210
we're hoping for in terms of this

37
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,610
session we're talking about security

38
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:49,000
usability I want to get a better

39
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,979
understanding of the need for security

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,799
is a billion IOT wanna get a better

41
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:56,259
understanding as well of the challenges

42
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,750
of our tea security usability and then

43
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:00,130
we'll look at some principles regarding

44
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:05,560
how we design

45
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:09,789
usable IOT security so let's set the

46
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,940
stage the first minister research shows

47
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:18,070
that good use

48
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:20,790
is do bad things as anyone as does any

49
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:23,590
one hand no dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde

50
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,500
anyone so it seems that we've gots a bit

51
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,570
of it is this flea personality in terms

52
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,150
of good users doing bad things the

53
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:35,620
question for our span is why do good

54
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:41,500
users do bad things as far as using

55
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:45,310
security has anyone ever read in any

56
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:51,520
cool tool or developed any cool tool

57
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:53,620
that they're proud of anyone no one ok

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,520
yes if you put your hand up anyone

59
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,610
written any worked in any cool project

60
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,560
ok ok all right

61
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:07,120
I'm usually proud of it we welcome cool

62
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,370
tools we build cool things but I guess

63
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,180
the point I'm trying to make before I

64
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,920
show the next slide is sometimes we

65
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,470
we're excited about silence' the

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,170
sexiness of our code or the security

67
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,239
feature that were developing or trying

68
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:29,679
to understand ok how does that translate

69
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:32,680
into the actual usage as anyone try to

70
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,300
tell their kids about perhaps if you've

71
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,920
got kids or friends who don't walk in

72
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,550
tech or walk in security

73
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:43,510
I bought that really cool tool that you

74
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:48,010
just built and they're like yeah why is

75
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:51,280
that most times people think most people

76
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:55,120
who are not security professionals who

77
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,850
are using tools that we build that

78
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,100
thinking can't is to just walk already

79
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,630
found this product just walk already if

80
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,120
I'm thinking about a smart home as we'll

81
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,489
talk about later on I want to use the

82
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,019
product or ality product I'm thinking

83
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:09,640
primarily about what it does for me on

84
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:12,100
open the garage door I'm thinking pop

85
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,380
most importantly about just getting

86
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,350
gouged are open kinda to just walk

87
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,350
already and maybe your heart is just

88
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:23,140
falling a little bit when you hear that

89
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:25,919
but this is my what I'll say to you put

90
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:29,580
your head up when Special Forces

91
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,370
are not pop stars although I move out

92
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,568
with Special Forces yalla talented

93
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,219
security professionals in different

94
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:39,659
areas of security most likely it won't

95
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:43,139
look as Special Forces for instance the

96
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:47,969
Netherlands or the US one from where I

97
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:50,520
live right now on Nigeria when from you

98
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:54,060
go out and do some people go to work for

99
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,818
instance hopefully not because of praise

100
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,500
and glory or because you care about the

101
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,029
people that you're trying to protect so

102
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,939
my challenge is hopefully you also care

103
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:05,490
about those who use your product so it's

104
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:09,210
ok if not everyone is enamored about the

105
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,259
specific security feature that's not

106
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,448
what you're out there to do you're out

107
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:17,039
there to make the products more secure

108
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:20,689
to you so that people can be safe now

109
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:24,779
what if we cannot secure the usability

110
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:27,500
let's take a scenario with your going to

111
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:27,500
the office on Monday

112
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:35,339
you've got to be at the office 8 by 9

113
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:37,379
o'clock but you've got this particular

114
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:40,050
car that you get to use so you've come

115
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:42,979
out at even let's say 6 o'clock you've

116
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,379
got to be in the car at 6 o'clock in

117
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:50,818
this particular car that you use in from

118
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:53,419
the driver's seat you can see the engine

119
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:56,120
in full display it's just like on a car

120
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:58,560
so now the first thing you have to do is

121
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,719
you've got this really cool tool an

122
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,689
electrical tools we apply some electric

123
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:05,310
currents to the solenoid now the

124
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:07,289
solenoid or to the starter switch

125
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,120
actually the switch then send some

126
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:11,490
electrical currents to the solenoid the

127
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,039
solenoid I tracked some iron rod which

128
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,949
causes the circuit from the starter

129
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:19,259
switch to the battery and afterwards

130
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:21,689
now the starter motor comes on and

131
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,129
begins to turn your engine I knew that

132
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:25,500
the engine is turning you got to watch

133
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:26,069
real closely the initial in turn to

134
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,879
March

135
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:30,719
elsewise the engine could go bad so as

136
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,990
they start ups

137
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:36,719
motor starting your engine quickly flick

138
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:39,310
the iron rod to turn off the electric

139
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:43,060
going to the starter motor

140
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:45,070
and then what happens then your engine

141
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:50,230
is nos come to life and you're able you

142
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:52,330
not have to drive this thin you must be

143
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:55,889
asking yourself the question why would

144
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:57,460
anyone go through such generation to

145
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:02,169
drive a car

146
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:04,810
I dare say though that will my team beat

147
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:13,210
that what my team beat that might not be

148
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:17,350
the case if cars were built solely by

149
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,760
mechanical engineers in mechanical

150
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,140
engineers where the walls were solely

151
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,940
responsible for building our lives in

152
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,599
the car it'll be a great car it'll be a

153
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,150
cool car well thankfully we have all the

154
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,520
people looking at aesthetics as well

155
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:33,969
such that I who I'm not a mechanical

156
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:39,240
engineering savant can use the car and

157
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:41,680
he just works what about the IOT space

158
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:46,300
IOT is interesting that it drastically

159
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,800
increases the amount of devices that one

160
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,150
person has got to care about with the

161
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:56,680
gases security so before we pops I would

162
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:58,299
say one computer half the desktop this

163
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,300
days now we have multiple computers

164
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,520
maybe a few computers what we'll think

165
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,310
about is smart home we're thinking about

166
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,820
perhaps 40 computers we could just use

167
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:12,100
40 as a number that one individual who's

168
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,909
probably not a security professional has

169
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,979
gotta keep secure secure maintain and

170
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,360
secure configuration it becomes a

171
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:23,700
nightmare for people who just want the

172
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,780
product to work unless what about

173
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,700
factories nuclear factories nuclear

174
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:32,890
reactors smart cities we're talking

175
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:34,809
billions and millions of devices how

176
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:38,319
does secure usability come into play in

177
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:40,329
such scenarios whereby you've got too

178
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,240
many things first for people who are

179
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:46,390
maintaining those systems to struggle

180
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,220
through secure configuration for

181
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,220
individual systems or individual devices

182
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,800
we'll talk about challenges of security

183
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,300
usability and then we're going to some

184
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,109
principles the first one is what I call

185
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:02,290
the five C's in some tough challenges of

186
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,880
security usability and the first is

187
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,939
security doesn't make sense to the

188
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:10,060
regular user so let's consider for

189
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,820
instance sandy with a pacemaker Sony's

190
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,569
got a pacemaker that helps regulate a

191
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,380
heartbeat

192
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:20,200
the pacemaker connects to a hub at home

193
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:24,400
on our office which can be remotely used

194
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,960
to administer the pacemaker how many of

195
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,949
us have heard about this issue a by

196
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,600
there was a pacemaker does that was

197
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:34,780
already deployed in people's hearts

198
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,150
essentially but suddenly people have

199
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,640
this at least one or two people have

200
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:42,790
this weird experience with the hats were

201
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,110
bidding faster and at what's going on it

202
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,270
maybe it's just a night in the day

203
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,900
whatever and your heart is beating fast

204
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:55,930
and it turned out that the manufacturer

205
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:59,050
was running tests on their heart anyone

206
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:00,910
heard the balusters oh my the Lord can

207
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,949
you manufacturers running tests in your

208
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,140
heart now this is the interesting thing

209
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,290
if you put something in most of those

210
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,630
hearts they assuming you know what

211
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,400
you're doing I mean it's in my heart if

212
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,189
it's in my heart I was assuming that two

213
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,980
things that happened then when I say the

214
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,720
regular user security doesn't make sense

215
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,360
the first one is assuming that the

216
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,640
experts are the experts sandy has also

217
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,430
perhaps got a mobile phone that she can

218
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,689
use to communicate or at this monitor or

219
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:33,849
the pacemaker via the same harbor

220
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:37,390
there's an option as well for Sandy to

221
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:39,250
restrict the connectivity to the hob

222
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:42,460
such that no one can actually reach a

223
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,830
heart or to ensure that the mobile phone

224
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:50,200
only her mobile phone come used to

225
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:52,150
connect to a heart what odds are for

226
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,550
most people if you put in my heart and

227
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:57,550
put that device there you probably know

228
00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:00,130
what you're doing and it's good

229
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,649
the second reality or the second

230
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,860
likelihood I should say for for this

231
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:07,720
first see they start is what we call the

232
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,089
krueger done in paradox which is the

233
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,870
less people know the more they think

234
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:15,790
they know right so in this case someone

235
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,470
is said okay I've got this pacemaker

236
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:23,170
I've got this hob in the in my home well

237
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:26,050
I'm an engineer I wire the circuit in

238
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:30,069
this house I've checked this device it's

239
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:32,140
good I've got friends and colleagues who

240
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:35,790
up till today will not drive or use any

241
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:38,020
car that has got Internet connectivity

242
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,290
they just don't want to use any car like

243
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,329
that

244
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,399
I guess the paranoia of man what is

245
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,500
possible takes them to the other extreme

246
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,690
whereas in some cases we know Italy do

247
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,690
and we think we know more than we know

248
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:55,719
ii c ii c has to do with security not

249
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,370
being objective of the regular user a

250
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,360
repetition of what i said in the past

251
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:05,170
and the message here really is seatbelts

252
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,589
as you mean security with the objective

253
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:13,120
of the regular user or a priority why do

254
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:16,360
we need to seatbelt laws so exactly the

255
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,279
graphic that's just showing different

256
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,440
countries with seat belt laws on the

257
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:24,610
fact that in many of those casados

258
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:27,220
countries have as it said here only a

259
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,190
quarter of all the countries report full

260
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:33,040
enforcement of civil wars and i've got

261
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:36,130
an interesting little story my brother

262
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,779
is a very cool guy it makes music and

263
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,410
it's also a computer scientist at least

264
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:43,420
i think is a cool guy but in some parts

265
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,630
of Nigeria that parts of Niger where you

266
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,550
you don't he should use a seatbelt well

267
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,939
there's no one to enforce it in studying

268
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:56,109
sections so sometimes I'm driving in

269
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:58,720
Arizona and I'm just thinking my brother

270
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,190
sometimes they use seat belts and I'm

271
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,010
driving and I'm thinking I hope my

272
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,650
brother's just wearing a seat belt today

273
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:08,319
perhaps I don't know if my brother likes

274
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,730
to leave dangerously or do we like to

275
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,859
live dangerously

276
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,989
so really the message there being that

277
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:20,230
security is not the primary objective

278
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:24,790
most times for most users we don't

279
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:28,949
demand usable security from vendors the

280
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:34,209
problem being that those of us who use

281
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:36,608
security tools are not exactly sure

282
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:38,819
about how much it costs us to use the

283
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:42,999
security features for instance if I am

284
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:46,449
configuring the secure connection from a

285
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:47,859
high OT up to the cloud what is the cost

286
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:50,639
of using the security feature in that

287
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:53,739
tool or in that product

288
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,109
there is no measurement and likewise the

289
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:58,299
research arm of vendors who put our

290
00:13:56,109 --> 00:14:00,549
security tools on the market in

291
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:02,919
department shall I say that is literally

292
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:06,249
such about the cost of using security

293
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:10,269
and that falls then into the producers

294
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:14,379
there is no it's no one's problem so to

295
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:19,839
speak as to making sure the cost comes

296
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:23,859
down for using the right security the

297
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,289
fourth C is a barrier to necessary

298
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:29,350
workflow so how the diagram Hassan is

299
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:32,769
trying to configure a senseless

300
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:36,519
connection to a sensor hub and having to

301
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:40,509
go through a maze to do that research

302
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:43,350
shows that barriers to necessary work

303
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:47,259
are one of the topmost reasons why

304
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:48,819
security is bypassed now let's assume

305
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:51,669
for instance you're trying to connect a

306
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:54,219
sensor to sensor hub and the sensor hub

307
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:58,509
only allows authentication with TLS

308
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,789
certificates someone who doesn't usiness

309
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:03,910
some sensors look form-factor sensors do

310
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:05,350
not support TLS authentication and so on

311
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,589
who's trying to connect such a sensitive

312
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:10,359
sensor hub is most likely gonna do one

313
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:13,389
of two things or if parks even most

314
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:15,850
likely one thing which is turn off yes

315
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:17,589
just turn it off so the challenge then

316
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,539
becomes how do you design such a sensor

317
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:23,250
hub such that it supports there are the

318
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:26,699
use cases asides the use case where

319
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:29,370
is it workable or how do you automate

320
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,920
the detection of other mechanism of

321
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,720
detecting what is supported by the

322
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,000
endpoint or the client that is trying to

323
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,860
connect the sensor harbor if it's

324
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,860
difficult to use most people turn it off

325
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,949
from the executives that through to the

326
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:49,020
user their different views of security

327
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,270
we can talk about the executives being

328
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,600
the folks who have this vision about how

329
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:57,569
you take the talent pool and use that

330
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:02,400
with regards to what the customers needs

331
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:05,040
to produce the product that helps to

332
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,020
improve revenue and now the architect

333
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,030
being saddled with designing through

334
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,980
that vision to actually release the

335
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,839
product and the engineer partnering with

336
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,450
the architect to bring that design to

337
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,790
reality and the user who now has got to

338
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,770
use the product different views of

339
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,230
security challenge then being for

340
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:25,800
security professionals to harmonize

341
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:28,740
security across the different views so

342
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,260
from the vision through the design and

343
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:34,140
implementation the next step then is

344
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:38,360
what about the users view of your

345
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,360
security product or security - as well

346
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:45,800
it takes us into what I call the 10 P's

347
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:49,980
in terms of principles for secure design

348
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:55,140
and specifically speaking to usability

349
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:58,440
for security Zion IOT the first one is

350
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,150
put on user hat which essentially means

351
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,090
remembering just all the things that I

352
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:04,770
talked about for instance security

353
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,260
perhaps not being the most important

354
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:11,520
thing for the user who's using this

355
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:15,599
product and the next one is secure

356
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:20,430
defaults only now this is how shall I

357
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:21,929
say not noon in fact it's it's best

358
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,510
called as the irregular secure design

359
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,550
principle when we consider the osce use

360
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,040
case and consider the millions of

361
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:32,490
devices that have to be secured or the

362
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,740
40 devices in a smart home if the

363
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,240
product doesn't come out of box are

364
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,549
pretty in securely

365
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,299
it most likely wouldn't be used securely

366
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:45,539
so the example here speaks to device

367
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:47,610
that has a con an IOT edge device that

368
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:49,559
has got to connect to the cloud and we

369
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,899
give the example of secure boot web by

370
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,210
the device as it comes up is able to

371
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:58,709
verify that the software that is running

372
00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:01,440
is signed by trusted Authority and has

373
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,419
those the the parameters that are used

374
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,840
to verify that the cryptographic keys

375
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:09,179
start securely on that device the

376
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,689
question then becomes for IOT many IOT

377
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:16,110
devices are on for long periods on for

378
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,869
months on for years how do we ensure

379
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,689
that we are able to periodically check

380
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:26,309
that the IOT device is still running in

381
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:29,009
software that is trusted another example

382
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:32,399
of security faults here just be we we

383
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:35,970
have we in terms of a smart home you can

384
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:39,268
think of the ring devices or the

385
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:43,320
commerce that let you see who's come to

386
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:45,629
the door it should just be HTTPS so this

387
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,360
is not new mostly a regular secure

388
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:52,498
design principle something else that we

389
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:55,740
often come across is people referring to

390
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:58,110
networks as okay we've got a factory

391
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,990
network or we've got a corporate network

392
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,668
and I'm trying deployed his device into

393
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,169
those networks and I'm saying okay we

394
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:06,570
don't need for instance to make sure

395
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:10,110
this traffic is encrypted because it's

396
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:11,700
shall we say a trusted network so the

397
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,459
message really is that there are no

398
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,129
trusted Network NSE research which is in

399
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,590
the comments on the slide tells us that

400
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:22,289
you should perhaps assume that any

401
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:25,009
network that you run in is already

402
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:26,999
compromised so you're running your

403
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:29,100
products within network with the

404
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,799
assumption that sophisticated attackers

405
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,139
most likely want to be undetected in

406
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:36,629
that network so shall it be a factory

407
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:39,869
network industrial network an

408
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:42,689
agriculture farm network a corporate

409
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:46,408
land network a home network they are no

410
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:48,539
trusted networks so we don't get to mock

411
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:50,010
off some items in terms of security or

412
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:52,919
traffic

413
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:59,100
secur design has no necessary in some

414
00:19:52,919 --> 00:20:01,440
networks if we understand that most

415
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,990
users are not as savvy as we are how do

416
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,510
we help the user to set up a system and

417
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:08,039
this startup principles at NPS

418
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,629
are to help us just start that journey

419
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:12,330
that's why I call them startup

420
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,760
principles this principle speaks to

421
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,408
target at risk information so how do I

422
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,750
eat the user who's setting up a system

423
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:21,000
so they understand the risk of the

424
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,950
choices that they make so here you're

425
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,130
trying to set up once again an IH device

426
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:29,010
to an IOT cloud and you're trying to

427
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:31,679
select on occasion options so we're

428
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,990
saying okay are we using which

429
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:39,120
authentication TLS and the first option

430
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:41,669
are using pre-shared symmetric keys if

431
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,529
these are for whatever reason decides to

432
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:45,539
choose one option how do you provide

433
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:47,220
information that helps then make a

434
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:49,140
better decision in this case saying hey

435
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,360
if you're using shit symmetric keys

436
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,549
you're having the same key in multiple

437
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,320
locations and that increases the risk of

438
00:20:53,549 --> 00:21:00,539
compromise that's related to this next

439
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,010
principle where we're trying to aid the

440
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:07,140
user with pre-configured pre-selected

441
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:09,149
configuration buckets so once again

442
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,899
picking back off that example connecting

443
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:15,120
an ith device to an IOT cloud and now

444
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:17,189
the option is for the user to select the

445
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,600
security level of their environment like

446
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,580
we said before they are no trusted

447
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,279
networks so anyway even if it be a

448
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,850
corporate land or a homeland we still

449
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,950
say in this example that it's perhaps

450
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:34,860
medium security for corporate lands and

451
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:38,190
for homeland or high high security risk

452
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:41,459
for communication from the IOT hub to

453
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:44,730
the cloud in an internet type scenario

454
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,799
and if one option is selected we're then

455
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,230
able to automatically select another

456
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:57,680
option religious pre-configured buckets

457
00:21:49,230 --> 00:22:00,470
of security controls for users IP

458
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,620
talking about designing to scale the

459
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:06,440
scale are with Iran in the IOT space and

460
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:09,500
sure leads to a difficulty with with

461
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,380
people making having to configure

462
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,540
individual devices so this example here

463
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,490
talks about zero touch device provision

464
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,610
in whereby you trying to ensure that

465
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:23,090
when a product comes out the box its

466
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:25,990
able to through secure means contact the

467
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:28,370
right iot-cloud backhand

468
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:31,490
variety device key that I've been

469
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,989
registered in the back end now that the

470
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,430
device key is also born in by the

471
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,530
manufacturer in this case into the

472
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:39,650
device so you bring out our two device

473
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:42,320
and it has the ability now to phone home

474
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,780
so the IOT cloud back-end and through

475
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,270
establish a TLS much authentication TLS

476
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:50,149
channel so I can download the right

477
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:51,680
configuration and the device comes up so

478
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:56,720
in this case it could be that one is

479
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:59,270
deploying 5 10 50 10 800 have a number

480
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,560
of devices but the device coming out of

481
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:04,940
the box is able to get the right

482
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:07,159
configuration by default the second

483
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,600
example has talked into the cloud really

484
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,600
talking about design to scale as well

485
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,659
whereby in this example we've got an IOT

486
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,340
smart CD back-end but outside of the

487
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,290
smart city specifics you're just trying

488
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:21,439
to ensure that as the device comes up

489
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,570
and sends traffic for the first time to

490
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,120
the cloud back-end the cloud is able to

491
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:28,850
identify this certificate and Tom

492
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,379
activate the device such that users are

493
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,149
not active after manually activate

494
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,520
devices as the device comes up it sends

495
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:37,880
traffic the first time they started as

496
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,889
associated is not if is recognizable by

497
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,070
the cloud and it's able to activate the

498
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:47,960
device and brings it up the SiC

499
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:49,639
principle here deals with what I refer

500
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,470
to as not allow intransitive

501
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,170
authorization it's more of a general

502
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,240
principle which means that an IOT system

503
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:59,120
administrator has to actively grant

504
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,120
authority and in such a system they use

505
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:07,790
anyone who needs authority must be able

506
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:09,959
to request Authority the seven principal

507
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:13,019
asked speaks to

508
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,840
one time anomaly detection and device

509
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:18,119
health checks and the message being that

510
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,330
in an outer scenario using machine

511
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:25,080
learning we should be able to detect

512
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:27,720
with what Aoife RT devices are behaving

513
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:31,199
wrongly so examples that we use here

514
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:34,440
will be CPU usage for instance we often

515
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,080
have IOT devices being attractive for

516
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,509
crypt digital currency mining because

517
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,220
they're always on so if for instance I

518
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:43,080
am able to attack an IOT device I don't

519
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,960
necessarily even care sometimes about

520
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,480
the data I might just care about the

521
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,220
compute power that it provides but now

522
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,749
if depending on the workload you're

523
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,029
running on allottee devices you should

524
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:57,179
be able to just get a sense of how much

525
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:58,830
CPU usage you expect and the example

526
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,710
will be given the traffic over the

527
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,269
network interface and in this case I'm

528
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,749
saying okay for instance if we're only

529
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:09,389
expecting to get a few kilobytes of data

530
00:25:06,749 --> 00:25:12,210
from the IOT device and we realize that

531
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:14,340
each RT device is processing 10 times

532
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,279
that amount of data of our network

533
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,959
interface card then there's a problem so

534
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,759
really just talking about runtime and my

535
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:26,759
detection especially even in this cloud

536
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:28,590
to age device type scenarios then we

537
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,529
also want to ensure that the IT admins

538
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:34,110
are able to seamlessly revoke Authority

539
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:36,690
so peeking back off that scenario that I

540
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:38,820
just described whereby amrok I am

541
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,830
running this edge device I've got this

542
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,230
outer cloud and this applies in any

543
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,990
scenario would I be agriculture smart

544
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,970
homes or smart cities if I'm able to

545
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:50,549
with principle 7 ensure that I'm

546
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:53,039
monitoring some particular metrics of

547
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:55,320
the i/o device regarding CPU usage for

548
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,720
instance or the traffic that is going on

549
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,490
the network interface card and then I

550
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,340
discard that I'm processing the network

551
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:04,259
interface card 10 times more in the

552
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,840
times of amount of traffic than I expect

553
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:08,460
the device to be sending then if the

554
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,740
system is probably set up we should be

555
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,049
easy for an for the IOT system

556
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,629
administrator to deactivate the

557
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:17,190
certificate ensuring that as the device

558
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:20,990
is not able to communicate with the rest

559
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,990
of the network or the cloud

560
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,870
9 principal super simple here is just

561
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,950
about keeping secret secret

562
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:34,459
and why do I say that in terms it's

563
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:37,040
usually most users will be slice a

564
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,560
garden by not having to worry about how

565
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,030
they manage secrets so a security

566
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,639
professionals you know if these secrets

567
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:46,160
are better kept in hardware or if they

568
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,570
are better kept in software and if

569
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,760
they're even if the company's software

570
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,530
which software is appropriate so put in

571
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,200
it super simply I'm not dragging it out

572
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:56,810
longer let's keep the secret secret by

573
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,460
default tied to the first principle most

574
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:00,050
users don't want to if most users don't

575
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,710
have to worry about it though we

576
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:06,919
thankful for it the last one speaks to

577
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:10,430
circumvention of security controls some

578
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:12,650
research also in the deck from couple on

579
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:14,770
Smith and one other person whose name I

580
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:17,600
forget right now speaks to the systemic

581
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:21,590
circumvention of security controls by

582
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:25,159
users we often measure with regards to

583
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:28,280
metrics our products are the features

584
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,320
that we develop are used the question

585
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:34,639
then becomes what about how they are

586
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:37,370
misused in an antitype scenario if we're

587
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,380
sending updates to analogy device I

588
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:42,860
realized that the updates are not being

589
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:45,380
applied the question then is why so if

590
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,600
users will systematically circumvent

591
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,730
security controls how do we not waste

592
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,010
the crisis always the problem unused are

593
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,990
to improve security controls so in for

594
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:57,320
instance with an updates on our to

595
00:27:53,990 --> 00:28:00,140
device if it so happens that the updates

596
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:04,250
are taking too long most likely what's

597
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:06,920
going to happen what do you think only

598
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:09,230
we turned off it will be turned off

599
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,900
that's this really short story about an

600
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:15,890
IOT device that was that was compromised

601
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:21,650
and they had to deploy I think perhaps

602
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:23,810
the deploy the operating system in real

603
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,550
time to that IOT device really trying to

604
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:29,300
deploy the software that brings the

605
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:31,790
device back up but they were using a

606
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:35,300
channel that could only process a few

607
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:36,899
kilobytes a minute so that's an unique

608
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,730
scenario with RT devices

609
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,030
but okay if people are turning off

610
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:50,250
updates just as an example why are they

611
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:52,710
turning off updates in closing the

612
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:54,770
challenge or more or better food shall I

613
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:59,100
say the the ask will be aiming for

614
00:28:54,770 --> 00:29:02,639
simplicity and clarity now in art speak

615
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:05,070
as I put it learner da Vinci this quote

616
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,720
of often this quote often attributed to

617
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:09,659
him states that simplicity is the

618
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,610
ultimate sophistication but ideas say an

619
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:14,850
engineer speak we're more likely to say

620
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:17,280
keep it simple stupid or keep it stupid

621
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,740
simple and I think both are saying the

622
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,840
same thing if we if we look at our

623
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,390
security these security features that

624
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,379
are developing were aiming for shall I

625
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:30,510
say simplicity leads us down the path of

626
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,210
less bugs as was in the previous talk on

627
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:36,120
a few guys were here and the long story

628
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:40,110
shot on this deck is that both the

629
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,489
artist who is saying that simplicity is

630
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,459
the ultimate sophistication and the

631
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:46,860
engineer who says keep it simple stupid

632
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:52,020
in both cases what they're both doing is

633
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:55,139
art secure design is art and we want to

634
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:56,700
aim for simplicity or clarity for

635
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,680
ourselves as we build and then for the

636
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,290
users who are making use of such

637
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,820
features of products we've got a few

638
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:05,690
more things and secured usability in

639
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:08,280
this book on artsy arts architecture

640
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:09,960
security and privacy there's some

641
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,760
resources here that I've gotten the link

642
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,470
with regards to circumvention of

643
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,290
security controls and the systematic

644
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,420
approach the users will often take if it

645
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:22,159
becomes a hindrance I'm talking about

646
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:25,290
how we get usable security as well as

647
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:28,890
the shall we say these other design

648
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:30,120
principles for usable security some

649
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:35,550
networks social networking information

650
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:36,840
and that's all any questions before we

651
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:40,070
go to questions first

652
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,070
applause first email

653
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:53,140
[Applause]

654
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:54,520
any questions so you might want to

655
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,800
correct me if I'm wrong but for what I

656
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:00,100
understood of IOT devices are battery

657
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:03,030
powers or are not connected to a power

658
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:05,320
network let's say and some of your

659
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,760
suggestions to improve the security for

660
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,310
example continuous monitoring

661
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:12,040
I'd imagine takes quite some battery

662
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:14,169
power is do you envision that your

663
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:17,139
principle should be put on all devices

664
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:19,360
or is it more a nuanced vision we're

665
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,700
sure if you have a lot of power you can

666
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,459
always monitor this device but maybe

667
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:27,580
sometimes we have to trade off usability

668
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:29,830
of the device itself not even like

669
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,730
usability of the for the for a client or

670
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:35,530
for the user but just for example a

671
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,120
sensor at a farmers place if you have to

672
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:40,480
recharge the batteries every that's a

673
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,979
week that might be difficult right yeah

674
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,200
that's a great point with regards to the

675
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,420
fact that some of the devices just don't

676
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,850
have the shall we say the power to

677
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,640
always be on as we process in to allow

678
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,409
you to process to run monitoring and

679
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:57,400
take that or cloud but the short answer

680
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:59,770
there would be the Gateway layer so for

681
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:02,500
instance if one has that's why rather

682
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:04,510
than have multiple even though even if

683
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,700
your sensors are able to process things

684
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,890
if you you don't want to have multiple

685
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,570
devices always on and always running on

686
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,520
consuming power but if you have the

687
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,960
gateways then where you're uploading

688
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,520
traffic to the cloud where you're

689
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,930
sending stuff to the sensors and then

690
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,720
there you're doing there's an

691
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:22,090
opportunity to do monitoring I with

692
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:36,190
fewer devices that are more likely to

693
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:38,560
have power high one question I don't

694
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:42,190
know this is a little more Hardware

695
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:45,040
specific but a lot of secure designs to

696
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:47,920
some extent rely on having a good heart

697
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,230
would trust Ankur I know that there are

698
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,180
currently alternatives to normal TPMS on

699
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:55,900
a discussion for example the usage of

700
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:57,250
SRAM puffs do you have any experiences

701
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,220
with such alternative

702
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:04,510
like what you like in practice see of

703
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:08,920
advantages and disadvantages Oh Marshall

704
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:11,470
and severe will be will be no I'm so -

705
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:14,410
and to keep it simple as rock I just

706
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,940
said in terms of TPMS yes but the

707
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,160
alternatives and are you asking

708
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:21,120
specifically to security stability for

709
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:24,730
those alternatives yes and no this is

710
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,459
like for IOT devices you normally you

711
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:31,900
don't have the budget for really

712
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:35,170
deploying TPMS so like for example s1

713
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:38,530
path is an alternative which as far as I

714
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:41,680
know is an idea of having something

715
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:44,350
that's easier to manufacture then a full

716
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:47,830
TPM but the question is not so much

717
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:50,409
related to - usability but on the actual

718
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:53,320
security that they provide or that would

719
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:55,840
depend on the use case I want you to try

720
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:58,870
it what what you're trying to store in

721
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,730
this case about a device is it better is

722
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:03,250
it is it even workable out all of its

723
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:05,800
starting software I want to see TPM

724
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:08,379
hardware based TPM right yeah only hard

725
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,449
we would like what you use for storing

726
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:13,330
the according public keys for secure

727
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:16,689
boot and also for the key material that

728
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:19,449
you use for TLS so the private key that

729
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:22,418
the client or the device uses to

730
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:24,129
authenticate okay in that case my answer

731
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:27,540
will be that there shall we say

732
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:27,540
different standards that try to reduce

733
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:34,510
if we were to answer properly different

734
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:36,159
standards I try to reduce the but a ton

735
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,020
some I realized I don't fully understand

736
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,510
the question is the easy challenge the

737
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:42,070
the IOT device not supporting the TPM

738
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:45,399
they're not having the processor part to

739
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:46,899
support the TPM chore yeah so talking

740
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:49,870
about alternate like cheaper

741
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:54,029
alternatives to TPMS okay let me answer

742
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:57,519
simply I'm not aware okay no problem

743
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,519
[Music]

744
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:11,910
can you repeat so so I'm not I'm not the

745
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:13,249
hardware expert I'm rather the software

746
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:17,490
expert but if we're talking about

747
00:35:13,249 --> 00:35:20,368
storing keys and so on this can be done

748
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:22,919
in in software by using something that's

749
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:26,849
called white box technology so you

750
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:29,730
basically build a safe storage or a

751
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:34,130
secured storage in software and it is

752
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:34,130
portable across wherever you deploy

753
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:45,950
sorry yes yes yeah yeah yeah so in HC

754
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:48,900
it's is there's a lot of white box

755
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,609
different white boxes used you know so I

756
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,160
think that's I don't know if it's

757
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:54,900
cheaper or not and some hardware

758
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,368
solutions but it's it's very usable

759
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:06,079
anyway thank you for this edition

760
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:09,450
anybody else one question about the

761
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,410
kilts which slash free vocation of trust

762
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,999
in the device what's the expected

763
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:18,808
behavior there because if it's no longer

764
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:21,419
owned by me and it's attacking others in

765
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:24,960
a botnet or something like that is the

766
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:27,539
standard recommendation to do something

767
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,249
about that or is it tough out of luck

768
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:33,029
now we have millions of more computers

769
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:36,209
out there spamming and being remotely

770
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:38,460
controlled by others so the the first

771
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,230
thing will be trying to ensure the

772
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,420
device not able to compromise

773
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:45,569
whatever our objective of the system is

774
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:47,400
trying to make so if one is able to talk

775
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:48,660
to deactivate the device certificate

776
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,700
it's not able to communicate with the

777
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,989
cloud so that addresses that problem but

778
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,669
I think you're talking about a logic

779
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:57,509
problem which is then what is the device

780
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:58,410
also able to do since an attackers got

781
00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:00,690
hold of it am i right

782
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:04,019
I as a vendor no longer trust that

783
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:05,579
normally assigned which I hopefully

784
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:09,089
didn't do in the first place yeah and

785
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:13,049
then but now the device is out there

786
00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:15,779
still and doing that stuff okay

787
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:16,559
yeah they sure answer everyone who still

788
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:19,259
have to

789
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:22,400
take the device off the network manually

790
00:37:19,259 --> 00:37:25,410
right I just make sure it's unable to

791
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,489
use the network at all so the first step

792
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,959
with the device that advocate is

793
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:31,400
ensuring that it kind of compromised the

794
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:34,348
system but also that takes us to another

795
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:37,079
angle which is how do you die activate

796
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:39,749
assist the device completely and turn it

797
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,549
off oh is that right the the broad kill

798
00:37:39,749 --> 00:37:43,669
switch is basically what I was looking

799
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:48,839
for I mean that would be nice but then

800
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:52,170
users will actually notice because if if

801
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:53,910
I'm a user that isn't comfortable with

802
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:56,119
security and all of that stuff and I

803
00:37:53,910 --> 00:38:00,089
just want to want that stuff to work

804
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:02,759
then how do I know that I have to take

805
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:04,170
it online offline it's still probably

806
00:38:02,759 --> 00:38:07,380
doing some of the work that I was

807
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:09,420
expecting okay okay there are multiple

808
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:12,630
questions in that question which is how

809
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:14,189
do I turn the device off perhaps more

810
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,019
hard wise you leverage some of the

811
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:17,609
competition within the device that is

812
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:21,258
still useful to me or do I extract that

813
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:24,509
out is the right yeah so how do we

814
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:27,689
disable it effectively just don't revoke

815
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:31,170
it the trust in it but can I say belit

816
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:33,029
if i know that i if you have if you have

817
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:35,069
a secure means of controlling that

818
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:37,949
device i'm so for instance there's some

819
00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:40,349
devices that have manageability at the

820
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:42,089
chip level for instance so if you have

821
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:44,699
manageably added chip level you might be

822
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:47,219
able to turn it off but also depends on

823
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:49,499
the scenario on the device if you has

824
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:50,910
that feature so to answer your questions

825
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:52,499
are simply depending on the features

826
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:54,058
donors got on the device can you

827
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:57,058
actually turn it off if you still have

828
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:59,099
We Trust eternal to the device outside

829
00:38:57,059 --> 00:39:00,959
of just the operating system whereby you

830
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:03,109
are using that for instance to do

831
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:09,808
regular updates and command and control

832
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:15,719
okay so thank you thanks it's time for

833
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:18,299
the last question almost is it yes the

834
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:21,929
opposite question I guess what if you're

835
00:39:18,299 --> 00:39:25,939
a user and you're not comfortable with a

836
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:29,970
device that you've bought and owned

837
00:39:25,939 --> 00:39:33,839
having a kill switch that you know some

838
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:36,089
the company could remotely switch off

839
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:40,290
and you know your device stops working

840
00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:42,060
and you're inside and to echo the

841
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,079
questions so that we make sure I

842
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,029
understand it

843
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:47,310
so what if you're a user and you're not

844
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:51,839
comfortable people having access to turn

845
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:53,130
off your device right that is an

846
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,990
interesting question it's an ethical

847
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:57,630
question with regards to already in

848
00:39:54,990 --> 00:40:00,149
general the controls are in the hands of

849
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:02,910
the manufacturers and to answer a

850
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:04,470
question so is your question let me make

851
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:10,740
sure I get the kernel is a question what

852
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:13,500
do you do then or is that right or the

853
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:15,839
the manufacturers should have that

854
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:20,369
ability or should we have some sort of

855
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:22,710
control or controls to prevent abuse of

856
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:25,170
that ability to turn off devices

857
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:28,170
remotely for example I think it becomes

858
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,700
a combination like if I were to lean

859
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,430
into what you're saying of technical

860
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,200
uneven regulatory controls because you

861
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,848
want an extent for instance the

862
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,189
manufacturer has to have some ability to

863
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:40,500
monitor and update the device especially

864
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:42,720
in a scenario whereby the users are most

865
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,819
likely not going to be doing that or

866
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,709
half the time or the expertise to do

867
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:48,270
that so that's can service its master

868
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,460
this scenario whereby you've got devices

869
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,950
at intersections you've got cars you've

870
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:55,890
got trains and IOT devices everywhere

871
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:57,750
I'm how do you update those devices in

872
00:40:55,890 --> 00:41:00,420
fact ideas so that they'll most likely

873
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:02,460
like you have it with with a mobile

874
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,710
platform no there's a likelihood that

875
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,380
you're gonna have a business that if a

876
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:09,720
business mob that develops for just

877
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,030
updating devices I'm making sure that

878
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,500
updated correctly so I think there is no

879
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:16,079
runnin away from that because the

880
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:19,260
devices still needs to be updated the

881
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,300
question then becomes how do we address

882
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,000
the ethical question or concerns of

883
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:26,099
users combination of technical controls

884
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,750
regulatory standards things like that

885
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:29,750
which are still being worked on

886
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:40,569
thank you very much then for to say this

887
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,760
last thing just um so it's not just

888
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:44,470
about me thanks for from making time I

889
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,150
hope it was useful thanks for coming to

890
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:49,600
conference thanks for hanging out here

891
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:53,550
so the last hands or applause I say for

892
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,549
yourselves please give yourselves a hand
