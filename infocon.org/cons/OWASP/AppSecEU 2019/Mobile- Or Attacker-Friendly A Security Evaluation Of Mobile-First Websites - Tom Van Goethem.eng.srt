1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:09,040
so I'm Tom and I will be presenting our

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,730
work well the work that me and my

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,940
colleague Victor over there we're doing

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:20,080
so it's on security analysis of mobile

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:21,910
first sites so mobile first sites are

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,778
sites that are specifically developed

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:28,210
for mobile users so for instance if you

8
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:30,609
go to twitter.com you might and well

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,640
with your mobile device you will end up

10
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:36,850
on mobile to twitter.com which is well

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,070
actually a different side than well

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,440
regular of twitter.com that you would

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:45,460
see when you would visit the site with

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,059
your desktop browser so usually they're

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:52,210
hosted on a different subdomain so

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:59,790
usually MDOT example.com like I'm not

17
00:00:52,210 --> 00:01:04,210
facebook.com/ I'm dot whatever and so

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:06,520
well it's like already a fun anecdote

19
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:09,969
that we discovered during our research

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:13,509
is when we were looking into things we

21
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:16,678
found that this mobile version of these

22
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:20,049
sites were already being used as kind of

23
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:22,810
phishing attempts so instead of the dots

24
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:25,600
today which put a hyphen and then it

25
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:29,740
would look to users that it would be on

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:33,788
twitter.com amazon.com and so on so for

27
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:37,679
instance yeah M - amazon.com is hosting

28
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:41,079
some kind of a scam and malware stuff so

29
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:43,299
if by accident you would type it

30
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:48,579
incorrectly or something then you would

31
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:52,659
end up on the site like this so yeah it

32
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:55,149
which well try to get you to accept the

33
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:58,090
notifications and when you reject it

34
00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:01,240
your poor word to another side and so

35
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:05,709
here the the redirects happen very fast

36
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:09,160
because I blocked them already but yeah

37
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:11,680
usually the well and you can see that

38
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,750
eventually you end up on some malicious

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,330
sites and most likely the previous sites

40
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,030
where also much we're also malicious but

41
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,310
they weren't caught by the firewall over

42
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:26,380
here so I did this recording today

43
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:30,280
that's why you see the right there but

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,410
anyway these mobile first sites they're

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,470
typically developed several years after

46
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,810
the desktop version so we try to get

47
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,430
like an estimate of how much time is in

48
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,870
between the development of the both

49
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,970
sides and we found that in a median the

50
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,070
mobile version of the site is developed

51
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,380
around 6.8 years

52
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,769
so almost seven years after the desktop

53
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,780
site and we used these mementos to find

54
00:02:53,770 --> 00:03:02,050
the first occurrence of the desktop or

55
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:04,120
the mobile site and this allows us to

56
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,670
well this kind of creates a unique

57
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,390
viewpoint on how security is applied

58
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:13,600
because we have two assets of a the same

59
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:16,600
company or same organization that or

60
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,720
like web assets that are developed one

61
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:23,140
like typically seven years before the

62
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:26,080
other so that's kind of creates a unique

63
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:29,799
viewpoint so if we make the assumption

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:34,060
that if a website is developed several

65
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:36,700
years later and security is applied at

66
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,910
design time then these web sites that

67
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:43,149
are created later so the mobile version

68
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:48,300
of the site they should contain newer

69
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,300
security features and these other sites

70
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,130
so when we talk about web security we

71
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:02,500
can kind of summarize it as two things

72
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:05,280
so yeah you have either the good about

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:09,070
the vulnerabilities and also the

74
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,200
security features that try to medicate

75
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,780
them so either they will completely

76
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,418
mitigate it so for instance if you set

77
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:19,630
or if you correctly set the extreme

78
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:23,219
options header then well you will be

79
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:28,240
safeguarded from click checking attacks

80
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,830
or it will try to counter the or limit

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,020
the consequences

82
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,120
so if you set the HTTP only attribute on

83
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,740
a cookie then this cookie cannot be

84
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:41,260
stolen to cross-site scripting attacks

85
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,050
so what we wanted to figure out in our

86
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:47,730
study is whether these these security

87
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:52,570
mechanisms whether they're applied well

88
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:56,560
at hoc so after an application has been

89
00:04:52,570 --> 00:05:02,969
developed or at during the design time

90
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:08,680
and yeah how are they applied so is it

91
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:10,630
like only will a website only configure

92
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,340
as a security feature for certain

93
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:20,350
aspects or will it do it across all its

94
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:24,789
endpoints so in order to figure this out

95
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:26,970
we did 4-legged well our research

96
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,980
consists of four different parts so

97
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:33,130
first we wanted to find these mobile

98
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,350
first sites in the second step we then

99
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:39,760
try to obtain the different kind of

100
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:42,160
features I'll go into more into detail

101
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,890
later what these features are and how

102
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,390
they try to capture the security hygiene

103
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:52,659
of a website the third part of our study

104
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,789
was a more statistical analysis where we

105
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,920
compared the security of mobile sites

106
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:00,190
versus their desktop counterpart and

107
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,590
vice versa and then in a later stage we

108
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:05,410
also looked into more detail into

109
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:10,510
certain security features on how they

110
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:14,470
are adopted so the first part of our

111
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:19,150
study was to find mobile first sites and

112
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:23,050
in order to do so we well visited

113
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:26,440
websites with two browsers so we have

114
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,020
our own crawling infrastructure which is

115
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,670
based on headless Chrome or a headless

116
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:37,859
chromium and in the one part it was the

117
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:40,900
basic one and in the other one we made

118
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,540
well the browser appear as if it was a

119
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,900
mobile browser so we changed the user

120
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:52,390
string we emulated different screen

121
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:58,780
dimensions and so on and so we visited

122
00:06:52,390 --> 00:07:01,210
one million websites and we captured the

123
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:04,859
redirects that were occurring for these

124
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:08,950
both browsers so if the redirect

125
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,540
happened if the user was redirected to a

126
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,270
different domain or a different

127
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,910
subdomain on the mobile client then on

128
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:23,289
the desktop client we considered this as

129
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:25,540
a potential mobile site so we use the

130
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,970
wall top 1 million

131
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,310
trango sites which is a research

132
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:36,190
oriented list for most popular websites

133
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:38,550
and we found that well a bit over 15,000

134
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:42,790
websites of these 1 million sites

135
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,940
redirected users to a different domain

136
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:49,570
or subdomain when they were visiting

137
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:54,190
over mobile versus whenever visiting

138
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:57,190
over desktop but for well to kind of

139
00:07:54,190 --> 00:08:00,430
clean up our data we had to filter the

140
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:03,550
websites that were kind of irrelevant so

141
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:07,000
some of them redirected uses directly to

142
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,830
the Google Play Store to kind of trigger

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,470
them to install the application rather

144
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:19,030
than just serving the mobile version of

145
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:21,400
their website some of them the where the

146
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:24,280
website was not accessible some of them

147
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,950
were empty then there were also some

148
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,760
duplicates so like google.com and Google

149
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:35,140
dot NL we only considered one google

150
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:37,689
there and yeah we try to find these by

151
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,370
using it like a perceptual hash and then

152
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,040
we clustered all the different groups

153
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:47,560
and that's how we managed to figure out

154
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:51,699
the duplicate sites and yeah in the end

155
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:56,079
they were also 512 sites that we found

156
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,370
that were compromised and I'll go into

157
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,260
more detail in the next slide

158
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:06,310
but so in total we found 10,000 222

159
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:08,530
sites that had a desktop version and a

160
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,300
mobile version that was served on a

161
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,880
different domain or a different

162
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:18,490
subdomain than the desktop version and

163
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:21,310
these are all like unique sites but so

164
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:25,060
well another anecdote is that we found

165
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:29,380
during this filtering process 512

166
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:32,890
compromised sites and I manually looked

167
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,600
into it and I actually managed to obtain

168
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:38,199
the source code of one of these

169
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,920
compromised sites so what happened was

170
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,260
if I as a mobile with my mobile browser

171
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,729
would visit one of these sites I would

172
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:53,020
get redirected to this www type dot r

173
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:56,100
u-- which is like a kind of suspicious

174
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:59,890
site and this site would redirect me to

175
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,620
some porn sites which with some

176
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:06,180
affiliate affiliates number such that

177
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:09,910
they might get some revenue out of this

178
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:12,329
but by observing the source codes that i

179
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,640
obtained from one of these sites i

180
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:18,480
figured that it was most likely that

181
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,890
this compromise was related to

182
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,900
vulnerability in some wordpress

183
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:26,770
wordpress plugin and while after

184
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:31,810
exploiting this vulnerability the

185
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:35,400
attacker uploaded htaccess file to the

186
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:38,800
root of this domain and then when this

187
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,959
each the exes would check for the mobile

188
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,329
string in the user agent string and if

189
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:48,990
this was present it which redirects the

190
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:54,280
user so this type of malware i think the

191
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:56,410
well it tries to like hide or hide from

192
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,750
the administrators because an admin

193
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,760
administrator might be more likely to

194
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,830
figure out that something is or

195
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,890
something bad is happening on their site

196
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:08,080
when they are visit well when they visit

197
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:11,080
it's over their desktop site but it

198
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:15,750
might be well less likely that

199
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,890
mobile users which well the

200
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,959
administrator would figure that when

201
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:26,709
it's only mobile users who are being

202
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:29,140
redirected okay so that brings us to the

203
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:31,899
second part of our study obtaining the

204
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:35,860
different features that capture the

205
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:38,230
security hygiene so security of a

206
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,750
website can be considered as like the

207
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,050
the vulnerabilities that it contains and

208
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:47,620
the defense mechanisms that are used to

209
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:52,240
prevent them or to harden the website

210
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:54,250
against them so what we could do is we

211
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,529
could try to find from abilities at a

212
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,050
very large scale to figure out all the

213
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:01,930
different vulnerabilities but this is

214
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:05,589
very difficult especially from an

215
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:08,199
academic perspective because well

216
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:10,170
already by just crawling sites we get

217
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,120
certain complaints of companies that

218
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:17,020
think that we are somehow abusing them

219
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,149
and then if we would run actual attacks

220
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:26,339
against sites well that also wouldn't be

221
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:29,050
very ethical and also if there was this

222
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,880
Universal technique to detect

223
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,760
vulnerabilities everyone would be doing

224
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,970
this and we always probably wouldn't

225
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,980
need to exist because there while all

226
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,279
permeabilities could be detected and

227
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:45,190
fixed so it's often very site-specific

228
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:47,860
so it's very difficult to find all these

229
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,500
different vulnerabilities so that's why

230
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:53,350
we went a different way so we try to

231
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,980
focus more on the defense mechanisms

232
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:59,829
that were used so the usage of these

233
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,800
mechanisms is typically recommended by

234
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:07,479
browser vendors and other organizations

235
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:10,240
such as wasp and its makes it all so

236
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,120
much easier for us as researchers to

237
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,910
observe the usage and adoption of them

238
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,820
because these mechanisms need to be

239
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:21,800
communicated to the browser and that

240
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:24,640
allows us to just capture these

241
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:29,540
typically through like a response header

242
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:33,010
and yeah it allows us to capture all the

243
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,010
different features that are being used

244
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,589
so I won't go into detail on all the

245
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,160
features but I just want to show that we

246
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:46,220
covered like different classes of

247
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,230
security mechanisms that counter both

248
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,050
different types of vulnerabilities so

249
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:54,529
the it should be only attribute and the

250
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:57,849
content security policy which are like

251
00:13:54,529 --> 00:14:01,550
either an attribute on the cookie or or

252
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:06,560
the case of content security policy new

253
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:10,370
response header we also did look in well

254
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,880
through the Dom to find forms that

255
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:17,779
contained a Caesar F token to prevent C

256
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:21,019
surf type of attacks of course in our

257
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:22,370
study we didn't log into or register and

258
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,640
log into sites

259
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:29,170
so these Caesar F tokens would only

260
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:33,819
defend against slogan C's Caesar physics

261
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:37,219
and and I clicked checking defenses

262
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:40,070
quite well some other things like mime

263
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,740
sniffing attacks that can be defended

264
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:48,110
against by the X content type option

265
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:50,240
header quite some features that well

266
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:53,149
we're trying to tackle the

267
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:58,010
man-in-the-middle attacks so we already

268
00:14:53,149 --> 00:15:03,050
considered using HTTPS as good security

269
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:05,810
practice and while that's important to

270
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:09,709
remember if we look at the numbers later

271
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:12,469
on and then we have some others like to

272
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:15,050
secure attribute on cookie the strict

273
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:18,260
URLs for security headers and so on and

274
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:22,729
then also some things that can possibly

275
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:25,610
go wrong like mixed content inclusion so

276
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:28,310
when we are on an HTTPS page and we

277
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:31,550
include a resource that's loaded over

278
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:35,030
HTTP and that's fixed content then as a

279
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:38,359
cell stripping where well that's like

280
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:41,930
vulnerability where the page is loaded

281
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:45,410
over HTTP but then there's a forum that

282
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:49,069
links to HBS but as an attacker we can

283
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:51,439
modify this resource over HTTP and three

284
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:57,680
parts the s such that the forum will

285
00:15:51,440 --> 00:16:01,700
still be submitted over HTTP and then

286
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:06,890
finally also some other things like the

287
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:09,200
sandbox attribute on iframes which all

288
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:13,130
can be used to determine what an iframe

289
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,740
is allowed to do and and as well as app

290
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:19,189
resource integrity which is the

291
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:24,070
integrity attribute and here we mainly

292
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:28,640
looked for this attribute on scripts and

293
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:31,460
then finally the refer policy which kind

294
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,160
of gives control to the web developer on

295
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:40,550
which refer headers will be sent to

296
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:43,910
third parties so an important note that

297
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:46,550
I should make is that well if you're

298
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:49,250
developing an application you don't

299
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,859
necessarily need to implement all of

300
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:55,460
these different features it often

301
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:58,240
depends on the type of character all the

302
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:01,640
characteristics of your application and

303
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,880
this specific functionality that you

304
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:10,819
offer so for instance if you don't have

305
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:14,360
any forms or any actions that can do

306
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:18,770
harm then while defending a and C super

307
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:22,399
tech well there ya wouldn't be something

308
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:25,910
that you would have to do or you could

309
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,680
allow web pages to frame you if that's

310
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,930
part of the functionality that you

311
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:35,390
provide so then you wouldn't have this

312
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:38,600
extreme options header but in general we

313
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:40,850
wanted to capture the security

314
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,780
consciousness of the web developers and

315
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:46,580
mainly the difference between the

316
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,860
adoption of security features between

317
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:55,520
the mobile and the desktop version

318
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:57,439
so we want to see if web developers

319
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,270
actually considered using one of these

320
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:05,690
features so in total we checked for 11

321
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,970
defense mechanisms and four potential

322
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:10,670
weaknesses so these are not actual

323
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:14,780
vulnerabilities but in some cases they

324
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:19,460
might be so we consider them potential

325
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:23,030
for weaknesses and then we well actually

326
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:26,419
obtain to the the data by visiting up to

327
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:29,990
20 pages per site and that's both on a

328
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:35,510
desktop browser and a mobile browser so

329
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:39,190
the emulated mobile browser and yeah we

330
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:41,690
used our customized crawler

331
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:48,410
infrastructure that we built at our

332
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:50,360
research group and then after we

333
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:53,419
obtained all the data we could actually

334
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,928
start performing some statistical

335
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:59,450
analysis I get the first thing that we

336
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:05,900
looked at was the number of features

337
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:07,910
that websites which deploy so well the

338
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:12,200
the most interesting thing to look at on

339
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:14,570
this graph is the well the bars at the

340
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,330
point zero and so it there you can

341
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,689
already see that there are fewer desktop

342
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,790
sites that do not have any of these

343
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:26,809
security features compared to the mobile

344
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:30,740
sites and then when we move more towards

345
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:33,980
the right so more swell websites with

346
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:37,490
more security features implemented we

347
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:40,580
can see that well the desktop typically

348
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:44,900
has a lot more or not a lot more but

349
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:50,350
well consistently more security features

350
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:50,350
implemented than the mobile counterpart

351
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:58,179
but well this is like a very rudimentary

352
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:01,060
thing so we wanted to figure out whether

353
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:03,460
mobile sites are actually more or less

354
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:07,690
secure than their desktop counterpart

355
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:10,570
and also which while security features

356
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:14,130
are more or less prevalent on mobile

357
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:21,370
sites also compared to their desktop

358
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:24,340
version and finally we want to know

359
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:28,330
whether these the efforts that are being

360
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:30,870
made to adopt these features are because

361
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:38,500
of the web developer that made them or

362
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:43,389
because of some other influences so we

363
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:46,240
used the wilcoxon signed-rank test which

364
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:48,850
is a statistical ml well a statistical

365
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,160
test for paired samples and that's good

366
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:53,649
for us because we have these paired

367
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,740
samples so we have the mobile version

368
00:20:53,650 --> 00:21:00,070
and the desktop version and it also does

369
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:03,070
not rely on a priori assumption of the

370
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:09,689
data distribution which is also good

371
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:12,810
because we well don't have this and yeah

372
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:18,840
so we use this test and then we also

373
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:18,840
performed mediation analysis because

374
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:25,889
more complex websites might have more

375
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:31,990
features just because it's more complex

376
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:33,970
and so we wanted to consider what effect

377
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:38,680
of this complexity is although

378
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:43,240
complexity is a rather vague term so in

379
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:45,250
our analysis we considered complexity as

380
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,680
something feature specific so for

381
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,470
instance for HTTP only attribute on

382
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,630
cookies we considered complexity as

383
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,370
something in terms of the number of

384
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:58,950
cookies that are being set on the site

385
00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:02,169
and well then we did all this

386
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:04,419
statistical analysis and we got this

387
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:08,739
very nice big table

388
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:13,059
so I won't even try to tell you where to

389
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:17,919
look at but what we can summarize this

390
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:20,440
table s is that we found that security

391
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,980
features are more prevalent on desktop

392
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:29,529
sites which we already saw in our bar

393
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:33,639
chart before and especially for features

394
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:35,739
related to men and mental defenses the

395
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:40,570
effect of the device so the fact that

396
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:46,869
you're that it's a desktop site has a

397
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:52,210
the biggest effect so for most features

398
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:53,529
however the effect of whether it's the

399
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:57,309
mobile version of the deck or the

400
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:59,440
desktop version is well very limited and

401
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:03,668
often statistically it Civic

402
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:07,840
insignificant so this kind of shows that

403
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:11,889
there is somewhat consistent application

404
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,720
of these security features across the

405
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:22,199
mobile and desktop version of the site

406
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:22,200
and our mediation analysis showed that

407
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:31,629
well there is an impact of the

408
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:35,350
complexity on on the adoption of these

409
00:23:31,629 --> 00:23:39,309
features so for instance sites with mark

410
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:41,939
piece or like for instance we saw that

411
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:44,820
desktop sites had more cookies and

412
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:48,460
therefore they were also more likely to

413
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:53,529
have this HP only or secure attribute on

414
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:55,539
one of these cookies and then when we

415
00:23:53,529 --> 00:24:00,639
look at the different features

416
00:23:55,539 --> 00:24:04,559
separately we can see that well overall

417
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:08,109
the adoption of these is very low so

418
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:12,609
against well the the exception is the

419
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:15,220
usage of HTTP which now around 60 or 70

420
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:18,399
percent of the sites are that we

421
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:21,880
considered we're deploying

422
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:25,750
but then for the other features we see

423
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:29,590
that well adoption is fairly low so yeah

424
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:32,590
almost all of them except the HP only

425
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:37,679
attribute like all of them were less

426
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:41,020
than 20% of the sites that use it and

427
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:45,280
what you can also see on this figure is

428
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:49,270
that the the number of features where

429
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:51,428
there is a an overlap of where both the

430
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:55,150
mobile as desktop version are using it

431
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:58,179
is well relatively high with a few

432
00:24:55,150 --> 00:25:02,500
exceptions such as the HP only attribute

433
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:04,390
where we see a lot more desktop sites

434
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:08,190
are using it compared to the mobile

435
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:11,080
version but this can likely be

436
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:15,010
attributed to the type of framework that

437
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,419
is being used but that's I will be

438
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,660
talking about a bit later in this

439
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,660
presentation

440
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:27,160
that brings me to the fourth part of our

441
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:31,240
study so the in-depth analysis and we

442
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:33,910
looked into more depth in to specific

443
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,910
security features namely content

444
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:41,470
security policy because it's a very

445
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:44,080
diverse and complex mechanism and it has

446
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:46,840
an impact on many different site

447
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,750
features and there was also a prior

448
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:53,070
study in 2016 that focused specifically

449
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:55,870
on content security policy so that

450
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:59,740
allows us to compare with this previous

451
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:02,409
study and we also looked at the adoption

452
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:06,370
of HTTPS because for most sites have

453
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:09,309
HTTPS adopted and it's also the feature

454
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:14,559
very firm to most effect of which

455
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:18,850
version of the site was being shown so

456
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:21,129
for content security policy we found 502

457
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:26,428
sides or desktop sites that were using

458
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:31,840
it and 482 sites so that's not that much

459
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:35,970
in total so I think around 5%

460
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:39,449
a bit less but what we saw is that when

461
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:43,120
content security policy is defined most

462
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:48,250
sites enable it on all the different

463
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:53,500
pages of their of their size so both for

464
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:56,430
the desktop where we found around 80% of

465
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:59,710
the pages that were covered when CSP was

466
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:03,790
enabled and we have something similar

467
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:07,300
for mobile and we also what was also

468
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:10,659
interesting is that we found that on

469
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:12,610
more than 90% of the pages so when CSP

470
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,940
was deployed we found that the same

471
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:22,899
policy was employed throughout the

472
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:26,770
entire site but then we looked into like

473
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:29,830
the usefulness of these of these

474
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:33,400
policies in particular to defend them

475
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:38,580
against crew side scripting attacks and

476
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:41,760
so we ran all of these policies through

477
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:45,820
the Google's content security policy

478
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:48,970
evaluator you know you can just google

479
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:54,250
for this and you will find it so you

480
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:57,010
basically tell it you give it a content

481
00:27:54,250 --> 00:28:01,090
security policy and it will tell you

482
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:04,330
whether there are any issues with it and

483
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:06,490
what we found is that almost all so

484
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:10,540
there's only two exceptions for desktop

485
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:15,340
and three for mobile they all had high

486
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:19,120
severity issues with their as policy and

487
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:26,409
most of them was related to the unsafe

488
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:30,489
inline property so then when we want to

489
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:34,510
compare with a study from 2016 to kind

490
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:38,650
of see how CSP is evolving we can see

491
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:42,160
that in our studied the default source

492
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:45,460
or the second line there was only used

493
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,409
by around 34% of their sites

494
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:51,520
whereas in a previous study they found

495
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:57,179
that 85% of the sites who are using it I

496
00:28:51,520 --> 00:29:01,270
should note that this study from 2016

497
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:03,909
was also by people from Google it's

498
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:07,299
based on a different data set so that

499
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:10,480
might explain to some extent why we see

500
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:14,350
different things but I think that the

501
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,270
evolution can still be seen there and

502
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:20,250
what's also quite interesting is that

503
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:23,379
these newer features like the newer

504
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:26,919
directive such as block all mixed

505
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:31,029
content and refer and frame ancestors

506
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:33,960
are being used a lot more than so three

507
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:37,779
years ago or three and a half years ago

508
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:43,870
so I think that's well quite interesting

509
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:47,649
finding then moving on to the analysis

510
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:52,750
of the adoption of HTTPS so we found

511
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:54,760
around 62% of the sites were using HTTPS

512
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,909
from both the mobile as well as the

513
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:03,549
desktop version and most of them so

514
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:06,330
around 70% of these 62% had a security

515
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:11,649
limitation on both sides

516
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:14,559
however there were 665 desktop sites

517
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:17,729
that were secure where the mobile

518
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:21,120
version was insecure or had some issues

519
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:24,100
and that was mainly related to the

520
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:29,678
mobile version automatically redirected

521
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:30,158
to http and around for around half of

522
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,980
that

523
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:36,760
we saw the inverse so where the mobile

524
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:39,490
version was secure whereas the desktop

525
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,860
version was not and that was mainly

526
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:45,179
related because there was some mixed

527
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,918
content inclusion on the desktop part

528
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:51,970
and yeah here you can see this in graph

529
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:55,149
form so you can see the well the light

530
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:58,340
blue line going from secure on the left

531
00:30:55,149 --> 00:31:03,359
side so the desktop version 2

532
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:07,408
to redirect to HP on the right side and

533
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:11,039
also the HP resources the darker blue

534
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:16,559
one from the desktop flowing to the

535
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:19,590
secure one on the mobile so we did all

536
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:23,129
of these analyses so what can we like

537
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:25,408
conclude from this so we found that the

538
00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:27,928
adoption of security mechanisms is quite

539
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:31,799
similar on the mobile as well as the

540
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:34,739
desktop version so both in terms of

541
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:38,158
which security mechanisms are being used

542
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:40,919
as well as Howard how they are being

543
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:45,539
used or how they are being implemented

544
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:48,210
and from this weekend well if our

545
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:52,109
previous assumption holds that a

546
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:55,679
numerous sites will have lower security

547
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:59,099
mechanisms if security is considered at

548
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,919
design time we can like say that this

549
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:05,999
hypothesis is not valid because we saw

550
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,460
that there is a similar adoption of

551
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:12,629
these security mechanisms so it's most

552
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:16,789
likely that security is a ploy is well

553
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:19,349
it's used as something reactively so

554
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:23,340
when we when you already have a website

555
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:29,158
and afterwards you decide now I want to

556
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:32,279
employ some security mechanisms and then

557
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:36,679
we also found that overall mobile sites

558
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:40,259
have well fewer security mechanisms

559
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:43,440
which might be because they don't really

560
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:46,919
need needed or there might be less

561
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,349
interest in securing them and also

562
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:53,059
what's kind of sad is that the adoption

563
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:57,029
of security features is quite low and

564
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:59,460
then when we actually look at the

565
00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:02,429
attribution of the security features so

566
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:07,019
we try to figure out where it was

567
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:09,539
because of the the efforts made by the

568
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:11,970
web developer that this mechanism was

569
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:16,170
deployed or by something else

570
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:18,990
we actually found that many features

571
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:22,950
such as the HP only attributes on

572
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:28,170
cookies were related or were there

573
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:30,630
because the because the website was

574
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:33,930
using a framework such as wordpress and

575
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:38,930
wordpress by default sets the HT only

576
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:38,930
attribute on cookies so this means that

577
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:48,810
that actually and the adoption is even

578
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:50,879
lower so there's still some work to be

579
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:54,990
done in this attribution because it's

580
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,030
not straight forward because the

581
00:33:54,990 --> 00:34:00,570
presence of a security feature can

582
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:04,040
depend on many different things it might

583
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:07,169
be the web stack that adds it there or

584
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:12,300
certain third-party libraries or other

585
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:15,659
type of scripts that make the feature to

586
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:21,510
be there and this can be either direct

587
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:27,540
so in case of WordPress or indirect to

588
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:29,790
some other third parties that added but

589
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,800
it is important if we want to capture

590
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:42,150
the security efforts that are being made

591
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:45,300
by the different websites and so that

592
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:48,050
means that the the conscience security

593
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:51,450
decisions that are made by the security

594
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:53,910
by the web developers is even lower than

595
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:57,720
this five to twenty percent that we

596
00:34:53,909 --> 00:35:03,029
reported in our study and well that's

597
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:08,939
that quiet set but how do we move on

598
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:13,410
from here so what are the good things

599
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:17,040
about what we found so we found that's

600
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:20,230
actually sites that are using

601
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,450
WordPress for instance they will almost

602
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:26,980
all of them will have this HP only

603
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:30,490
attribute so that got me thinking like

604
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:35,290
when I when someone would create a new

605
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:39,540
website well if they don't consider any

606
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:42,490
of these three so when someone is

607
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:45,190
creating a new website wouldn't it be

608
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:48,939
nice if you would start from already a

609
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:52,630
more secure version and then if you

610
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:55,330
would need to so for instance a more

611
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,340
secure version which already adopt all

612
00:35:55,330 --> 00:36:00,730
of these different security mechanisms

613
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:05,470
or at least a selection of them and if

614
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:08,170
you would somehow somewhat somehow have

615
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:10,509
to make an exception because these

616
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:13,450
security features are blocking what you

617
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:16,720
want to do or want to achieve then you

618
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:20,770
already make the web developer think

619
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:23,319
about the change that they are doing and

620
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:29,470
then the potential consequences of

621
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:32,530
making this change so well I think this

622
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:35,520
would be nice to have but it's a bit

623
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:39,460
tricky because security features are

624
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,920
constantly being added well new security

625
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:45,460
features are being added and existing

626
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:49,090
features like for instance CSP are also

627
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:53,230
being being changed so it's difficult to

628
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:56,140
figure out how to start from a secure

629
00:36:53,230 --> 00:37:02,230
version of what our website would have

630
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:04,830
to look like but still even if you don't

631
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:08,370
consider everything it's still

632
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:12,130
significant not having anything at all

633
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:14,980
so what else can we do so we know that

634
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:16,960
websites will likely have some

635
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,870
vulnerabilities I don't think anyone

636
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:24,700
will claim that their website is 100%

637
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:28,120
secure so what we can do is we should

638
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:30,040
try to make exploitation more difficult

639
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:35,430
or impossible

640
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:37,720
or for the attacker by for instance

641
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:40,870
employing one of these security

642
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:43,959
mechanisms another thing that we can do

643
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:47,049
and I think that's an important takeaway

644
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,930
of this presentation is that we should

645
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:52,750
try to reduce the threat surface that

646
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:55,180
users are facing so for instance if you

647
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:58,540
have a mobile website then it wouldn't

648
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:02,140
make any sense to expose desktop users

649
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:04,509
to this mobile site because any

650
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,970
vulnerability in one of the mobile

651
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:10,900
version of decides which effects or

652
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:13,509
shoot only effects mobile users and the

653
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:16,150
same for well desktop

654
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:20,590
well vulnerabilities in the desktop side

655
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:26,830
should only be affecting desktop users

656
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:28,990
so it's very simple - based on the user

657
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:31,060
agent string detects whether the current

658
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:34,870
user is a on a mobile device or a

659
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:38,820
desktop device so we should already make

660
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:42,190
sure that desktop users cannot just be

661
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:46,140
well cannot simply browse to the mobile

662
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:49,750
version so if we just have some redirect

663
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:54,670
beforehand that would already prevent

664
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:56,710
these users from being exploited so that

665
00:38:54,670 --> 00:39:00,190
brings me to the conclusion of this

666
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:04,420
presentation so we performed this

667
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:07,840
large-scale comparative study on mobile

668
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:10,090
first sites and this kind of provided us

669
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,090
with a unique four viewpoint because

670
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:17,170
mobile sites are typically developed

671
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:21,160
years after or several years after the

672
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:23,350
desktop site we found that desktop sites

673
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,930
have a slightly higher adoption of

674
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:29,640
security features but in general the

675
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:34,960
adoption of security mechanisms is still

676
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:37,089
quite low although we did find that when

677
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,180
a security feature is being adopted it's

678
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:42,090
typically universally adopted across all

679
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:46,169
assets of

680
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:48,870
a website and we also have some

681
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:52,080
indications that the usage of these

682
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:54,810
mechanisms is not considered during

683
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,500
design time but only apply it to read

684
00:39:54,810 --> 00:40:00,720
directively

685
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:04,290
and yeah so the we also found that by

686
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,970
having more complexity websites are also

687
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:11,460
more likely to have one of these

688
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:15,480
features and also it's sometimes quite

689
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:19,320
difficult to attribute who made this

690
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:21,170
feature to be there so there's still

691
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,330
some work to be done in order to

692
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:27,330
correctly attribute the presence of a

693
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:31,130
certain security feature to the efforts

694
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:35,130
that are made by the web developers

695
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:39,180
overall yeah does the adoption of these

696
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:42,020
mechanisms is quite low but moving

697
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:46,109
onwards it would be nice if we can have

698
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:48,930
some mechanisms where we have secured

699
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:52,350
well where we start from a secure point

700
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:54,600
and then develop applications starting

701
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,080
from there rather than the other way

702
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,480
around

703
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:02,250
by first making an application and then

704
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:04,950
trying to secure it and then well the

705
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:09,090
last thing would be that you shouldn't

706
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:12,359
or should try to not expose users to

707
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:14,940
announcer's unnecessary threats by for

708
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:19,980
instance redirecting desktop users to

709
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:24,330
the desktop site automatically so we did

710
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:27,900
a bit more of well there's more details

711
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:30,390
to be found and I would like to invite

712
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:34,110
you to take a look at our paper which

713
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:36,690
you can find on this link and with that

714
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:38,870
I would happily answer any of your

715
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,870
questions

716
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:54,380
Oh what kind of simulated et use for

717
00:41:50,599 --> 00:42:03,140
mobile sites how do you mean simulator

718
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:10,039
but for what forward so we used headless

719
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:13,279
chromium and so we used the simulator

720
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:16,549
that's built into chromium so you can

721
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:20,180
also just use Chrome and then open the

722
00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:22,910
developer tools and land uses and now we

723
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:25,339
made some custom modifications to make

724
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:34,240
sure that websites would detect it as a

725
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:38,450
mobile site nice research did you try to

726
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:42,799
reach those owners with the biggest

727
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:47,020
issues well we didn't really look for

728
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:50,980
issues so the lack of usage of these

729
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:55,609
mechanisms is not necessarily an issue

730
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:57,859
so you can have if your website would be

731
00:42:55,609 --> 00:43:00,380
perfectly safe and secure and there

732
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:04,578
would be no vulnerabilities then it's

733
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:08,270
not well strictly necessarily necessary

734
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:12,589
to use one of these features so we

735
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:16,390
mainly looked at like the positive sides

736
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:23,328
which don't know to not be that positive

737
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:24,589
but yeah yeah really nice research I was

738
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:27,289
wondering since you did a lot of

739
00:43:24,589 --> 00:43:30,680
crawling did you mainly look at public

740
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:32,869
sites without where you are not logged

741
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,149
in because I'm wondering if that could

742
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:37,160
make a difference regarding if there is

743
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,650
no session cookie then maybe the cookies

744
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,078
there are less protection measures for

745
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,240
the cookies yeah I think it would

746
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,569
definitely be interesting to also look

747
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:50,629
into well the logged in version of the

748
00:43:47,569 --> 00:43:52,970
sites however creating accounts for

749
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,620
10,000 sites and automatically logging

750
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:56,870
into the

751
00:43:53,620 --> 00:44:00,500
well it might be feasible but it's not

752
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:03,799
that trivial so we firstly couldn't look

753
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:06,950
into that but I do think that by doing

754
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:10,900
so we would probably find some different

755
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:10,899
things we've time for one more

756
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:18,440
I'm sure you'll take questions

757
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,700
afterwards I'll be fast you got my

758
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,490
attention when you were talking about

759
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:25,129
the lyrics what I notice quite a lot

760
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:27,049
other redirects to malicious size due to

761
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:28,490
modernizing did you get the name

762
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:34,130
interesting in science during your

763
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:37,189
research into the sink or which did you

764
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:40,670
mean like the amazon.com type of thing

765
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:43,220
or for instance if even if I visit

766
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:45,650
alleged in a website like new site or

767
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:48,109
something similar are I sometimes get

768
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:51,470
redirected to malicious cyan't do too

769
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:53,870
and at Utah militia set so um my

770
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:57,200
question would be did you also notice

771
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:57,859
such a behavior during your research was

772
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,339
it a bit

773
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:05,270
was it a lot not at all or in this

774
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:07,690
research we didn't encounter as far as I

775
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:10,430
know any malicious advertisement

776
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:14,960
although we also didn't actively look

777
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:18,350
for it but we have ongoing research that

778
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:21,650
looks specifically into malvert izing

779
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:27,500
and type kind of tried to figure out the

780
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:29,840
entire ecosystem I think that's all the

781
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,000
time we have um the key notice the end

782
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,590
of the day keynote is downstairs in ten

783
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,860
minutes

784
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:37,780
Thanks

785
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,780
