1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,439
right alright thank you very much for

2
00:00:04,729 --> 00:00:08,990
the introduction so I'm gonna Williamson

3
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:09,889
you'll hear me for 45 minutes talking so

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,780
I just want to know a little bit about

5
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:18,250
you guys who a few here is a developer

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:23,360
quite some of you is your pen tester

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,360
awesome ooh a few ears a manager see

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,040
zeroes all right we got a lot of

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,460
different people I hope I'll bring

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:34,030
something for each a lot of you so my

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,050
name is Aaron Williams sir this is me

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,670
ears Twitter account if you want to

13
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,748
follow stuff about a mobile security

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,539
testing guide I think that's most

15
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:43,280
important let's get started so today I

16
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:44,300
want to talk about the mobile

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,989
application security verification

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,669
standard it's called mas PS for now the

19
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:51,529
mobile security testing guide I want to

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,989
do some examples but before we continue

21
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,289
I want to have a toast of you guys

22
00:00:53,989 --> 00:01:02,748
because we recently got flagship status

23
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:04,519
so I just want to toast to all the

24
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:06,619
volunteers that helped us especially

25
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,899
people like Harold Blankenship at the

26
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:10,640
board level but also the leaders that

27
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:12,740
have done all this stuff everybody who

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,469
filed issues pool requests are in over

29
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,689
there contribute in any other way

30
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:19,880
because this project is not just me this

31
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:21,880
project is a bunch of people and that

32
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,810
will be repeated throughout to talk us

33
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,960
frantically I'm just happy that I can

34
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,789
hear share all this stuff with you guys

35
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,798
because of the force of OWASP basically

36
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:33,310
and I think that's brilliant so let's

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,310
get started

38
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:45,859
sorry sorry yeah cheers guys sorry so um

39
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,229
in order to keep it a little bit

40
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:51,859
interactive I have a bunch of questions

41
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:56,210
so who a few knows a little bit about

42
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:57,009
mobile security all right so many of you

43
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,969
should be able to answer these questions

44
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,850
let's start with the first one shall we

45
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:05,619
so can you do a cross-site scripting

46
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:11,780
attack on a native mobile application

47
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:13,340
sorry it's a unlikely yeah does anybody

48
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,000
thinks anything else do you think this

49
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,350
is easy to do

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,330
or possible and how would it be possible

51
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:24,910
if it would be possible so everybody

52
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,050
thinks it's impossible

53
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:30,410
sorry just rephrase okay so who thinks

54
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:34,610
it's possible raise hands who could

55
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,870
think of a method to do this it's

56
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,760
getting tougher isn't it

57
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,910
shall we try another one just food for

58
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,459
thought guess we'll get to them later go

59
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:48,980
stright request forgery

60
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:54,650
would this be possible a native app who

61
00:02:48,980 --> 00:03:03,530
thinks it's possible all right who could

62
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:05,630
think of a method to do so well it could

63
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,490
be a version of it of course because

64
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,470
you're talking intense as opposed yeah

65
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:17,780
so there's also URL schemes so yeah

66
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:19,400
there's possibilities in there yeah if

67
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,780
if that will be loaded definitely

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,340
definitely but as you can see you have

69
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,570
to think a little harder about this one

70
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,830
if I would present something about

71
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,989
JavaScript it would be fairly easy

72
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,930
wouldn't it but now all of a sudden ooh

73
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:33,110
we got we got turn on didn't we at least

74
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,269
our hats that is so mobile security is a

75
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,519
little bit different in the sense that

76
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,440
stuff is different CSRF is different

77
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,500
cross-site scripting is different but

78
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,019
both traversal is just ordinary easy and

79
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,540
often forgotten like they forgot with

80
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:49,519
the office application so you could just

81
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,820
go through all directories within the

82
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,340
same books including the documents that

83
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,260
should have been there privately but

84
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,330
what about other stuff let's talk about

85
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,010
data leaking so through locking so

86
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,380
you're look at or you're looking output

87
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,730
from from your iOS application you're in

88
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,070
secure storage because you thought using

89
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,738
the SD card was a good idea or what

90
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,720
about IPC so app extensions sharing data

91
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:13,100
in the wrong way intense packing a lot

92
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,350
of extra stuff that shouldn't be there

93
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,709
and we can continue on and on and on

94
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:21,890
about this and what about weak

95
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:24,169
authentication mechanisms I think there

96
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,860
has been a long period where you could

97
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:28,780
actually just get a ticket for

98
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,610
SEC as a speaker by just breaking

99
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,219
something open is show how broken it was

100
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,530
in terms of a mobile app because people

101
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,419
forgot about it or I'll maybe just

102
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,888
didn't know

103
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,270
and what about reverse engineering

104
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:41,860
because all of a sudden all that logic

105
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,960
is on the client-side so we start

106
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,259
promising stuff about how you could make

107
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,080
it hard for an attacker to get through

108
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,550
yeah so it's different so we tried to

109
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,340
come with a solution a few years ago

110
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,500
already and that's this so we got a

111
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,840
bunch of things basically going on first

112
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,550
of all there's the mobile application

113
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,349
security verification standard which

114
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,629
basically sets up a bunch of

115
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:07,750
requirements on what you should do in

116
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:09,009
order to have security hygiene and for

117
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,750
those by the way making pictures and

118
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,340
stuff slides will be online

119
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,599
YouTube's record it if you have

120
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,549
questions or rather if you raise your

121
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:18,190
hand so we can talk about it would make

122
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,990
a little bit interactive cuz hearing my

123
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,710
voice for 45 minutes might not be the

124
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:25,419
best idea okay good other than that is

125
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,919
the MSD G basically which basically

126
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:28,599
explains how you implement those

127
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:29,740
requirements and we'll see how that

128
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:31,509
works a little bit later

129
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,009
next to that especially for the Caesar

130
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,319
did have a little bit of a classical

131
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:38,469
environment we got compliancy checklists

132
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:41,020
and that might sound odd but it actually

133
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:43,089
works very well even for non Caesar

134
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,378
environments if you offer basically a

135
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:46,270
list of these are requirements you

136
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:47,919
should abide by and they are combining

137
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,919
with the links towards the right

138
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,900
chapters in the MCG to implement them

139
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,400
stuff becomes very easy because now

140
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,258
there's no more excuse for Stack

141
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,049
Overflow you can just direct them to the

142
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:01,479
parts you have to be so obviously this

143
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,650
is something Prius keV and we're talking

144
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,849
to the tin can through butters or

145
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,388
talking with it to cater butter to

146
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:10,539
actually implement that to have mas PS

147
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:12,849
and mcg also in SKF but for now this can

148
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:15,009
do at least some basic job in helping

149
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:16,509
people out and if you want to play

150
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,979
around we got a bunch of mobile apps so

151
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,440
we got crack meats to do reverse

152
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,870
engineering find the passcode find the

153
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,580
password do funny stuff and we got a

154
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,339
bunch of hacking apps in various

155
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,310
languages where you can just try to

156
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,900
break SSL pinning where you can try to

157
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,409
download the storage get all the

158
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:38,649
confirmation confidential data and stuff

159
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:40,719
and alongside that track there's a lot

160
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,759
more because our focus

161
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:44,619
it's actually native apps but we got an

162
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,330
increasing demand for hey but how do I

163
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:50,110
do this exam or in or how do I do this

164
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:52,448
in something else so we got psy project

165
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,699
set up to basically cover the similar

166
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:57,399
requirements for react native exam or in

167
00:06:54,699 --> 00:07:00,129
a flutter and which means going into

168
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,589
dart the latter one but for all cases we

169
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:05,529
still need volunteers so we set up these

170
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:09,519
checklists online check them out through

171
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:12,729
the MC gene if you are very well

172
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,589
equipped in the hybrid space please come

173
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:16,839
and help us to fix that for the people

174
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:18,939
that have asked about it

175
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:21,129
we also are setting open or fostering a

176
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,479
daughter project the mobile threat model

177
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:24,309
project because it's nice to have

178
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,169
controls and direct somebody directly to

179
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:28,899
just implement this come on just do it

180
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:30,789
that's easier but these modern

181
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:31,329
developers in many societies don't work

182
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:34,209
that way

183
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:35,860
they often start asking why so we have

184
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:37,300
to why in our heads when we created this

185
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,149
in an issue she can see why the

186
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,829
requirement is relevant but that's not

187
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:43,089
an easy way to work so right now we're

188
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:45,579
setting up a mobile threat model around

189
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:47,800
it to make it easier to let them

190
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:49,479
understand what to do in the end if you

191
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,360
just want to put requirements down

192
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:55,719
somebody's face let's go other than that

193
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,099
we try to unify all those mobile

194
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:59,739
projects because there's been a lot of

195
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:03,699
dying stuff out there so we try to

196
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:06,068
combine that and together with that we

197
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:08,469
try to motivate people to open-source

198
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:10,919
the stuff they brought based on the MCG

199
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:14,829
so that we can promote the ecosystem and

200
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:17,109
we really mean we as a team with behind

201
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:19,239
the MCG project so we try to really make

202
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,699
a change not just some mobile part but

203
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:23,498
go beyond that if we're successful I

204
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:26,349
don't know I'll leave that up to you

205
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:29,619
guys to judge so these are the people

206
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:31,300
that did a lot of the hard work both

207
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:33,219
during open security summits that's

208
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,719
where the larger beef happens but enough

209
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:37,120
about the background let's go into the

210
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,459
details of the stuff that's happening so

211
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,769
the mas PS basically is a set of in

212
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:44,670
master right now 81 requirements the law

213
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:47,649
stable version 104 has 64 I believe and

214
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,790
it's divided over certain areas where

215
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:50,350
you can have the requirements so

216
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,329
architecture and design all the other

217
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,529
J's which is just can read and we're

218
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:56,109
trying to do

219
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:58,480
is trying to guide people on what you

220
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,790
should implement and win so for your

221
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,439
basic marketing app you should at least

222
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,899
have some standard security it's good

223
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:07,719
hygiene you know making sure you got a

224
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:09,730
proper base stuff we ask there is not

225
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,220
hard it's something you can do by

226
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,990
default even sometimes by stick overflow

227
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,600
programming that's still possible not a

228
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,160
problem

229
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,990
the l2 defense adapt are a bit harder

230
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,350
those are for apps that actually have

231
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:25,180
risk when it will be broken so think

232
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,740
about banking apps think about your

233
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,239
commercial app that actually has paid

234
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,220
content where people have paid for in

235
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,300
those kind of things and that's up of

236
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,800
that if you want to do some IP

237
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,378
protection we got reverse engineering

238
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,359
category so as you can see it makes

239
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:38,980
sense to start doing this and then

240
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,680
depending on what you think it's worth

241
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,170
it starts at selecting the right key

242
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,479
requirements from the other ones and

243
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,529
lately we've seen that some of the

244
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,449
companies that have embraced this also

245
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,579
started to handpick this in terms of

246
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:53,050
prioritization and then make sure at

247
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:55,209
least have some basic hygiene and walk

248
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:58,120
on but as long as you have some leveling

249
00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:01,800
it's easier to prioritize so let's have

250
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,910
a look at those require Michelle Wie so

251
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:09,399
these are for instance requirements

252
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:12,149
regarding storage and privacy and it's

253
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:17,290
highlight one of them because these

254
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:19,059
requirements are also well first of all

255
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,949
they will be opinionated because we

256
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:23,529
thought of them basically we thought of

257
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:25,120
them together with many other people and

258
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:27,189
the requirements will change over time

259
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,899
because the world around us changes over

260
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:31,870
time so let's have an example about that

261
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:33,370
one the clipboard is deactivated text

262
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,740
fields that may contain sensitive data

263
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,800
because you know if you would copy page

264
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,529
that so why would we do this why would

265
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,929
you think it's important to disable the

266
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:48,339
clipboard exactly because it's shared so

267
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:50,139
what if we would disable that in the

268
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:54,490
password field what would happen with

269
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:56,860
modern password managers they'll broke

270
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,350
yeah they don't be broken so we're back

271
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,839
so that didn't work so we evicted it

272
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,189
again so as you can see even though we

273
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,329
tried to be stable we just tagged a

274
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:05,889
version with a stable set of

275
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,709
requirements which we then try to let

276
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:09,080
live at least for

277
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,490
half a year and never abandon in that

278
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,860
sense so people can select the

279
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,690
requirements they believe in and in

280
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,750
meantime we go on but we do try to keep

281
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,970
it as stable as possible because you'll

282
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:23,660
hear later on you'll you'll be able to

283
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:26,090
figure out why in a moment so the

284
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,130
current status version 104 we added some

285
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,200
MSD IDs which are basically IPS has

286
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,390
correlate to IDs and chapter heads which

287
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,160
you'll see in the next slide we got a

288
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,870
bunch of translations some of them are

289
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,510
really beautiful just staring at them

290
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,820
makes me you know very impressed because

291
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,730
I don't read traditional Chinese but it

292
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,740
looks really beautiful it is vetted the

293
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,090
translation so basically we have a group

294
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,980
of translator there's a group of fair

295
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:51,230
fires so you know at the moment

296
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,180
something is translated that different

297
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,680
people have checked it out and therefore

298
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,989
you can rely on that because we think

299
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,550
it's important to have something only

300
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,480
when we can really ensure that it will

301
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,890
have value otherwise you end up you know

302
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,830
hoping something is okay I don't think

303
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:09,110
that's a good solid basis we have a

304
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:11,450
growing adoption so we're a court weird

305
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,610
way to do it according to NIST there's a

306
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:19,850
bunch of governments that are enabled in

307
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:21,290
their governmental programs for it even

308
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,240
on the uu level it's right now being

309
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,490
promoted within a mobile payments area

310
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,290
so that's pretty cool we got a lot of

311
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,210
companies embracing it and if your

312
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,430
company is embracing it you want to show

313
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:33,260
that let us know so we'll add you to the

314
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,089
users of them D files so they know that

315
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,640
if you're a pen tester you know how to

316
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,140
work with this or if you're just a

317
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,300
developer working with this then other

318
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,900
people might know okay so it actually

319
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:47,270
makes sense to move on with this right

320
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,040
now we're basically creating new and

321
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,900
updated requirements to align with the

322
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,439
other projects that were either dying or

323
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,730
very active so that it won't be that we

324
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,960
are missing certain requirements that

325
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,450
the other end it won't be that we're

326
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,740
trying to conflict with them sometimes

327
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,630
it also means working together for the

328
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,850
guys from the ASVs to make sure you also

329
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,400
have alignment with them because we

330
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:10,760
started off aligned in version 0.1 and

331
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,260
then everybody diverted so now we're

332
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,240
trying to make sure that what we say

333
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,520
makes sense too in what you read over

334
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,450
there and vice versa so that we as OS

335
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,449
best have a single voice in that sense

336
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,400
we hope to make this all released at

337
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:28,170
December because we still have to go to

338
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,610
the translation process yada yada cetera

339
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:33,099
about those embassy IDs here is an

340
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,230
example so this is basically a modern

341
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,060
layout of the network requirements not

342
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,339
all of them it's just a few as you can

343
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,770
see that ID correlates with over there

344
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:43,540
so you can just wrap within the embassy

345
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,400
or just certain getup and it will be

346
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,920
fairly easy to see how we want to

347
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,069
explain that requirement to you more

348
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,510
importantly how you can contribute so we

349
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,240
got contributor guidance I over there

350
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,710
just check it out it's fairly easy if

351
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,240
you look at contributing to LMD

352
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:02,830
at the MCG repo it's also fine or just

353
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,670
like us through our slack and we'll be

354
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:08,980
okay I would say take it really use it

355
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,420
tweet about it contribute or just give

356
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,920
feedback in person if there are some

357
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,650
things you think is really wrong we

358
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,810
would love to learn from you because no

359
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,370
matter what the masses say by adopting

360
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,779
it just and moving forward it might

361
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,790
still be that we're doing something

362
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:23,589
awfully wrong and we just blind by the

363
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,540
fact that we're doing it that way for a

364
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:27,430
few years so if you see something that

365
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,040
could be improved let us know final

366
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,989
issue create a pull request and let's go

367
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,390
together all right

368
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,339
mobile security testing guide so the

369
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,050
testing guy is divided in three parts we

370
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:40,240
got the general testing guide because a

371
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:42,219
lot of the stuff is the same in the end

372
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,810
if you do some authorization stuff in

373
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,690
iOS I hope you do the same in Android

374
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,189
otherwise you're in a fun place to be

375
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,850
and then we get specifics for the

376
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,529
platforms

377
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,120
next to that is a bunch of crack meats

378
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:54,160
which were created by one of the first

379
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,910
leaders Burnham Weller I would say try

380
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,890
them out

381
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,719
show me your reverse engineering skills

382
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,089
come with new right up to show how cool

383
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,470
you are we're breaking it it's a nice

384
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:06,279
challenge by the way we already have a

385
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,930
lot of write-ups

386
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,790
so if you're completely stuck you can

387
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,529
peek and spoil your own fun a little bit

388
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,959
and at least get through them next is

389
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:16,209
the MCG playground so with a bunch of

390
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:19,890
different apps a cocktail app a Java app

391
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:22,839
for Android and an objective-c app for

392
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,069
iOS so it's easier to Swizzle and I

393
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,670
believe we're also doing some stuff in

394
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:30,100
in Swift but really this whole project

395
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,300
has a lot of contributors it's really

396
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,470
about standing on the shoulders of

397
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,240
giants

398
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,190
because before we did the stuff and get

399
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,770
up there have been two initiatives with

400
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:41,440
just Google Docs people like me dongsik

401
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:43,510
Singh takua edit started doing stuff

402
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,840
over there and we just revived the

403
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:49,330
project on get up and try to grow it and

404
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,220
foster it so in that sense this has been

405
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:54,370
one of the most I think it was one of

406
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,800
the coolest projects I've ever got

407
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,990
sucked into and I never wanted to get

408
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,000
out any more so if you want to have a

409
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:04,120
similar friendly experience in a very

410
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,700
cool well is some governed structure in

411
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,590
terms of the team in terms of how we try

412
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:14,590
to help each other

413
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:16,420
please join all right so current status

414
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,070
we were restricting its over the last

415
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,900
summit which meant a lot of stuff get

416
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,150
shifted so if you're familiar if the mcg

417
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,730
sorry for having to relook up your stuff

418
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:26,290
differently but now becomes easier we

419
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,250
have a lot of focus on the Iowa security

420
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,099
and reverse engineering

421
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,020
we actually got a book and it got

422
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:37,300
discovered so I guess we should now

423
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:39,640
promote it funny story about Luke it was

424
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,849
only supposed to be there for the

425
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,010
sponsorship package and then this guy

426
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,720
found it on Hulu and the order did tweet

427
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,540
about it and we figured let's make sure

428
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:55,180
it gets to a good level so let's go use

429
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:57,130
it luckily we also have just ebooks in

430
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,530
just PDFs or you just go through get

431
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,140
through book etc so we're currently

432
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:04,480
working on sorry we have been various

433
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:07,750
updates and iOS 12 and 13 and and rapine

434
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,510
q we had a few missing test cases in the

435
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,790
reverse engineering area and we're

436
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,829
working on automating the built of the

437
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,480
crack niece and the playground to make

438
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:19,329
it easier to make it compatible with

439
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,430
newer versions of Android and iOS if

440
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,710
you're an iOS expert or not even expert

441
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:26,980
with just a beginner level or an Android

442
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:29,680
and who likes this stuff a lot just join

443
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,090
us big issues work on them some of the

444
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,610
people that have grown all the way to

445
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:37,149
Top Contributor started as I don't know

446
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:39,219
anything Android oh this device is

447
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,320
running Android okay so even at that

448
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,330
level you can start contributing because

449
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,780
it will end up with being a beautiful

450
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,760
research class for you

451
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,830
so one of special things at the end

452
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,450
because normally we toast over here but

453
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:55,139
then the wine would go die we would go

454
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:57,120
dead so let's go the leaders come to

455
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,770
British co-author sponsors and donators

456
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,080
we got quite a few donations which we're

457
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,420
gonna use eventually to pay technical

458
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,399
editors a lot of our users and of course

459
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,990
the people that helped us out again

460
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,760
now you can contribute to the MS DG

461
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,590
stated over here just follow those

462
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,810
guidelines to start picking stuff and

463
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:18,840
make it work you can find it over here

464
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:21,750
and do stuff with it and we doe have one

465
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,340
final notes unfortunately ever since we

466
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,260
got flagship we got more attention from

467
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,980
a commercial perspective and we also got

468
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:31,440
more opinionated attention from people

469
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,000
that wanted to be very clear and what

470
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,800
they thought was right or wrong given

471
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,690
questions asked from slack or Twitter by

472
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,430
others so please free the code of

473
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:42,090
conduct before proceeding or just be

474
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:47,300
nice all right thanks let's do some

475
00:18:42,090 --> 00:19:00,600
hacking shall we so questions so far

476
00:18:47,300 --> 00:19:03,060
yeah hey again yeah just the question

477
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,379
about the integration to SKF he said

478
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,169
there's like kind of discussion going on

479
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,420
there so what's what's the next step

480
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:12,150
what's decided what's holding her back

481
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:14,760
yeah good question about the SPF so the

482
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:17,190
SPF has been evolving of course and so

483
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,410
did the mas 15 mcg so where they were

484
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,730
evolving in terms of how to create cases

485
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,940
and how to create content we were

486
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,650
involving in the content itself we just

487
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,600
said during the conference

488
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,850
sit down together to see for a path how

489
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,040
this could be eased out and we figured a

490
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,889
solution that would make it easier for

491
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,840
the SKF to actually start adopting this

492
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:40,050
we're importing it easier and have

493
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,669
references to some parts of the MCG so

494
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,350
they don't have to copy paste everything

495
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,690
but it will be easier to have traffic to

496
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,310
one to the other obviously that requires

497
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,900
an internet connection at first but

498
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,300
we'll figure out something later for

499
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,970
having stuff in databases but we're

500
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,740
actively working on it and I think we'll

501
00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:01,830
get somewhere this year

502
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:03,630
thank you you're welcome any other all

503
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,699
right so as I promised this talk would

504
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,590
actually be in the description about how

505
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,529
to use this stuff right so let's let's

506
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,149
dig in so the easiest thing to start off

507
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:13,950
with his network because I think most of

508
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:15,719
you will know some bits and pieces about

509
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,970
how to do networking properly how to

510
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,380
secure that etc so if you look at the

511
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,450
network communication requirements this

512
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,149
is the larger part of the list let's

513
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:28,230
look at a few of them so the hygiene

514
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:32,010
requirements the l1 l2 basically means

515
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:33,510
using TLS correctly make sure that the

516
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,330
settings are aligned of best practices

517
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,950
make sure that you verify a certificate

518
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,350
properly and don't accept everything in

519
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,720
the world for that the MCG would then

520
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:45,779
guide you to how to do that so what does

521
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,149
it mean to use TLS which settings should

522
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:50,299
you use and also refer to the RFC's for

523
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:54,629
further explanation on what that means

524
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:55,918
and of course certificate validation it

525
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,480
becomes more interesting when you're

526
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,289
talking about pinning so for insiders

527
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,610
and l2 reckfarmer or we say that you can

528
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:05,610
start to pin to a certificate or it's

529
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:07,320
public key and that's of course more

530
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,908
interesting to start having a look at in

531
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,178
terms of how we can then break that

532
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:15,029
again right so who view is not familiar

533
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:19,620
with certificate pinning or public key

534
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:21,539
pinning I guess you're all familiar so

535
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:24,449
all of you probably recognize what this

536
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:26,039
is right the representation all these

537
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,320
fields together what is it just shout it

538
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:32,399
out sorry

539
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,779
shout it out louder no I see so I heard

540
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:35,580
some doubt that's alright that's alright

541
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:38,399
it's a certificate with its fields

542
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:42,029
gentlemen obviously I can craft stupid

543
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:44,219
stuff but I didn't work so given that

544
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:45,870
little bit of a twitch that they just

545
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,850
had with you guys let's just still

546
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,039
explain what happens right so when you

547
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,870
create a connection with your back-end

548
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:54,990
and you're using TLS what basically

549
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,340
happens is that the client basically

550
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,169
starts connecting the server says we

551
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,809
will talk to you about blah surfer says

552
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:02,309
back yeah sure you can talk with me

553
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:04,049
these are the type of particles or

554
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:06,178
ciphers that has support these are the

555
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:08,250
extensions has a bird go ahead you as a

556
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,600
client say all right I want to support

557
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,780
these let's talk that

558
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,780
then something is selected based on the

559
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:18,690
service configuration and then he sends

560
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:21,030
back and confirmation of what's going to

561
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:23,040
be used and he's gonna send his

562
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,660
certificate or rather said the

563
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,700
certificate belong to the domain on

564
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,490
where the trail is terminating the

565
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,770
endpoint is basically running that

566
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,090
certificate might also be augmented with

567
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:35,190
a bunch of other certificates that

568
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,800
basically show that this certificate is

569
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:41,310
okay or not what you end up is getting

570
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,960
descent and then of course the point

571
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,879
create bumps that's where a lot of

572
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,830
arguments has been in the past is that

573
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,020
certificate pinning has been implemented

574
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,580
a lot in Stack Overflow as in look at

575
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,320
all those beautiful bytes let's make

576
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,939
sure all of them are the same so then we

577
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,350
talk about certificate pinning which

578
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,520
basically means at the moment your

579
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,980
certificate has expired

580
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,080
and you rotate it all those bytes at

581
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,790
least these bytes will differ so you can

582
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,370
compare it if you want to doesn't work

583
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:07,440
so clever people set it use the hash

584
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,489
from that the hash flow of course

585
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,190
therefore the moment you have a new

586
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:13,020
dates therefore breaks again doesn't

587
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,940
work so you have the alternative public

588
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,320
key pinning where you basically pin to

589
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,730
this little fellow

590
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,320
so the sips of public key information

591
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,150
which basically has the algorithm

592
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,919
identifying the public key value and

593
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:27,600
sometimes you even just pin to the

594
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:30,650
public key value itself little funny

595
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,929
thing behind this it's wonderful to have

596
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:36,350
public key pinning or anything alike but

597
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:38,610
that does require that's your

598
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:40,050
organization is mature enough to protect

599
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:44,189
the private key where the public key

600
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:49,020
belongs to just saying so given that we

601
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:50,970
implement it how do we verify that so

602
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,580
the MCG shows how you can implement that

603
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,110
in various ways for Androids in iOS

604
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,570
because you have various methods to work

605
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,639
with and even we do this on hybrids

606
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:01,919
because we got this question so many

607
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,920
times you figured okay okay we just put

608
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:09,090
it in and walk away fine but what about

609
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:12,720
verifying it or bypassing it so if you

610
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:16,050
bypassed and SSL pinning on mobile

611
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,060
already okay for those who raise their

612
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,440
hands about four I'm sure it's going to

613
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:22,590
be incredibly boring the next ten

614
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,580
minutes but for those who didn't please

615
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,649
pay attention

616
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:28,470
there's a bunch of things you can do so

617
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:31,199
below if you just want to first check

618
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,570
whether actually you got anything on in

619
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,360
there below Android seven just install

620
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:38,009
your certificate CA on the device on

621
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,840
Android seven and above you have to

622
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:43,110
actually rewrite a network certificate

623
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,988
for security configuration to accept the

624
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:48,119
CA that you're adding and then try two

625
00:24:45,989 --> 00:24:49,799
men in the middle application similarly

626
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,689
an iOS you installed just the

627
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:54,269
certificates and then you tried two

628
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,590
million a milot and then if the

629
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:58,200
community should come in on the middle

630
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:02,129
it you get a client-side certification

631
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,749
error or a client handshake client-side

632
00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:06,029
handshake field or clients handshake

633
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:07,730
field you know at least something is

634
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:11,549
happening over there that apparently

635
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,989
seems like pinning so how do you want to

636
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:14,789
bypass it then so there's a bunch of

637
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:16,830
ways to do this and if we had all the

638
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:18,149
time we could go through everything so

639
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,129
if you have time left we can still do

640
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:23,518
the demos of Android but wanna focus on

641
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:27,389
iOS for now so the first one is using

642
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:30,059
SSL kills it's free - this is basically

643
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:32,248
the most easy way because that means

644
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:34,769
you're going to do a jailbreak of the

645
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:37,409
device you install Cydia and if CD I are

646
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:39,509
just gonna install SSL kills switch v2

647
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:41,669
the alternative is to do a dynamic

648
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:43,289
instrumentation on jailbroken or non

649
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:46,379
broken devices but we'll talk about that

650
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:48,149
later let's have a look at an

651
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,738
application for instance so here we have

652
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:53,729
an application and here we have our

653
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:56,759
beautiful burp suite running and it's

654
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:59,419
just a demo app it's not a real snapchat

655
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:03,419
app even though it might look like that

656
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:08,789
so we open it up we enter our

657
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:10,710
credentials and it couldn't connect

658
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:12,690
because it spins so we can't move

659
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,700
forward so inter settings we have the

660
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:22,840
SSL kill switch v2 standing by we turn

661
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:24,760
it on and

662
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:30,580
have to do this as all explained in mcg

663
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:31,810
basically and as you can see even though

664
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,520
the rest of the connection didn't work

665
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,379
because that back-end has been disabled

666
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,790
we did get the first handshake parts

667
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:44,110
about logging in the credentials and

668
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:46,750
stuff that has been intercepted so again

669
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:50,800
with SSL Killswitch v2 sorry it's a bit

670
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:53,290
of a bug so what happened basically what

671
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,940
happens SSL kills HP - uses the MS hook

672
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:58,420
function from the mobile substrate which

673
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:00,370
is packaged within Syria and it starts

674
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:04,210
fetching certain operating system-level

675
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:06,520
methods so um iOS 9 these methods are

676
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,710
being patched in on is 10 and 11 this

677
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,050
one is fetched and the idea is basically

678
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:15,010
when you do your NSL when you do your

679
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:16,389
TLS handshake you're using either NSL

680
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,280
your connection or something else

681
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:22,390
there's three different methods and so I

682
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:24,070
believe I'm sorry and by having the

683
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,650
method best even though these methods

684
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:29,020
will give back our failure this is not

685
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,820
okay you basically patch the methods on

686
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,879
an operating system level and situated

687
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,409
they always say ok so in that sense

688
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,990
there might have been an instruction to

689
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:39,340
pin and the pinning field or the

690
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,320
validation of the certificate or a

691
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,990
public key field but because we patched

692
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:47,379
the methods they will always say ok so

693
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:49,030
we can bypass them this is what you do

694
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,010
an operating system the moment you

695
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:54,160
enable this and this appeals which is

696
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:56,590
free to you enabled it for everything so

697
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:03,160
if you would use your own device for

698
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:04,840
testing be a bit careful might help but

699
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,390
what if you don't want to jailbreak

700
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:11,290
so jailbreaking requires maintenance who

701
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:13,330
view every jailbroken device whoever

702
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:19,960
view lost it accidentally due to an

703
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:21,429
update because you're working on

704
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,230
something there's a pop up you thought

705
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:27,370
you recognized the pop up you click OK

706
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:29,170
and then ok there we go it used to get

707
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:32,649
harder to find a jailbreak

708
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:34,630
thank Apple for iOS 12.4 it's good thing

709
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,400
good thing because that makes it easier

710
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,600
again because although the rest of

711
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,490
the free to talk would be about how

712
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,340
important it is to have a nonzero broken

713
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:45,820
device to use it this version will allow

714
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:47,560
you to do an easy job with that but the

715
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,179
problem of course if you jailbreak and

716
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,550
you have an epic geo break protection

717
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,930
then you also have to bet that for some

718
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,970
reason which is going to be harder

719
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:57,640
because you've bets the operating system

720
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:01,150
and not necessarily the app itself so

721
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,040
with freedom and this wrapper around it

722
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,180
objection you can actually just start

723
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,450
pitching the real-time of the

724
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:09,010
application itself let's have a look so

725
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,690
over here we have a similar set up if

726
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:16,030
you use to have the last time now we're

727
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:17,950
going to intercept stuff again so we're

728
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:20,290
using iOS deploy to deploy the

729
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:23,890
application it's just been bet to the

730
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:32,710
device we skip the betting process for a

731
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:34,480
sake of time they always unfortunately

732
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:36,370
one thing I have to note the moment you

733
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,140
start doing this the time we have to

734
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,629
weigh right now is not the demo effect

735
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,370
that's unfortunately natural then latest

736
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,470
forgets its we freed I have been quite

737
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,479
faster and there's numerous wires deploy

738
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:48,100
that's more effective but you end up

739
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,140
with some waiting basically for because

740
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,969
of all the deployment stuff so now we're

741
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,080
you're running objection and we're

742
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,220
running objection Explorer which

743
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,800
basically means we're starting the

744
00:29:54,220 --> 00:30:00,130
interactive repple and now we actually

745
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,580
have a rebel inside the runtime of your

746
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:04,780
app well that's fun you can do a bus re

747
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,990
you can do a bunch of things with that

748
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:11,139
but more importantly let's now just try

749
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,880
to pitch the rent I'm so objection comes

750
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,800
with a bunch of pre effects freida

751
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,630
scripts and one of them is just breaking

752
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:24,879
the pin so first without you know

753
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:28,320
fetching it let's just rent it so we get

754
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,520
the notification but no data going back

755
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,700
as you can see there's out of complete

756
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,170
so it's really nice actually now it's

757
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,960
being bets as you can see a bunch of

758
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:40,780
methods are being patched given the run

759
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,310
time so now we're in it again we

760
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,920
actually start other stuff getting

761
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:47,139
poured in and here is the data we've

762
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,600
been waiting for so that's actually

763
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,400
quite easy to do we're not

764
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,049
creating those tools but we do guide you

765
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:56,160
basically on how to use them which makes

766
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:59,230
it all fairly easy so what happened

767
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:03,100
basically underlying SSL stuff has been

768
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:04,929
patched so the room time the method

769
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,740
being used to call the system level run

770
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:10,270
time system level methods or the

771
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,970
prepackaged methods have just been

772
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:14,980
patched for this particular app with the

773
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,360
feeder gadgets inside that's a lot

774
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,910
easier because now for sitting you can

775
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,740
use your own device relatively secure as

776
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,510
long as you don't use the the app that

777
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:25,330
you just tested to be free dad to start

778
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:30,400
doing normal stuff but you have a lot

779
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:32,379
more freedom now obviously you have

780
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,360
something similar in Android so you can

781
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,309
use objection of freedom in androids and

782
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,320
otherwise if you have a rooted device

783
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:39,908
you can use expose for system level

784
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,139
patching but we're going to skip that

785
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:45,669
right now and for the sake of time so

786
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,350
let's take another one authentication

787
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:50,380
requirement so that's a pretty long list

788
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:53,260
but one that's been around quite a few

789
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:56,860
long time is biometric authentication if

790
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,809
any is not event bound using an API that

791
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,010
simply returns true or false instead it

792
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:02,350
is based on the unlocking the keychain

793
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:04,570
or key store just to make sure whoo if

794
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:07,240
you went to apps like Europe two years

795
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:11,110
ago and what was at the don't touch me

796
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:15,730
that way talk and it's good who have you

797
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:20,649
ever bypassed a biometric authentication

798
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:24,520
till now okay sorry sir but for the rest

799
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:27,120
I guess you'll will have a nicer time so

800
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:30,549
there's two ways to implement touch ID

801
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,049
there's one where you basically say

802
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:34,389
you're gonna have a bunch of protection

803
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:36,490
classes towards the keychain which could

804
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,200
only be unlocked via touch ID or face ID

805
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,760
so that means that you have to

806
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,370
authenticate through biometrics to

807
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,990
unlock the entry or actually unlock the

808
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,590
keying material that protects the entry

809
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,480
in the keychain

810
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,730
that's very nice because that means that

811
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,010
you have something to work with the

812
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,929
other way is using la context the

813
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,490
context kind of works like this so you

814
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,620
implement a method that does the

815
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:58,450
following local education context

816
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:00,549
evaluate the policy makes sure that your

817
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:03,160
device is the device owner if the

818
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:04,930
biometrics give a localized

819
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,240
um so this is where you put something in

820
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:09,340
that's being there in a pop-up and after

821
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,380
that you get a success or even of a

822
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,149
terror you get success and they you call

823
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:18,670
your success method so you get a false

824
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:24,130
orell so failure wait wait

825
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:28,090
what's up of this what if we can call it

826
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:31,920
directly so hmm why bother with having

827
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:34,149
you know any biometrics so we try it

828
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,830
so there's a bunch of way I can do that

829
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,930
you can either use needle which is

830
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:39,730
another mobile penetration testing

831
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,620
suites which you can use Dempsey to

832
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,650
explain how that works or you can again

833
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,000
use objection in both cases what we're

834
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,860
going to do is we're going to take that

835
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,950
evaluate policy localize reason apply

836
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,600
method and make sure that no matter when

837
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,700
it's cold will always go into the

838
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,389
success callback and just go for a

839
00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:06,670
success method so for the sake of seeing

840
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:07,840
something different here's needle so

841
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,100
when you start needle you have to do

842
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,830
some pre installation stuff which we'll

843
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:14,409
skip right now but sole apply later so

844
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,668
here you can see it's actually it's

845
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:17,109
coming for bunch of modules and one of

846
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:21,279
them is for instance the co crip touch

847
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:23,560
ID and here you see the need of the

848
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:32,330
clients running or neil server interface

849
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:34,909
running so now

850
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,460
trying to lock in you have to put you

851
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:39,170
touch it in and you just authenticated

852
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,659
of that shitty there was no dialogue in

853
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:45,409
there it was just plain skipped because

854
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:47,690
it wasn't there just to make sure we

855
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:49,219
also have a little video over here what

856
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:51,920
would normally happen if that wasn't the

857
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:55,779
case so here we have the same app sorry

858
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,780
for going a bit up and down in there so

859
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:10,040
here you get to touch any pop-up but

860
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:12,410
with the other version you don't so in

861
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,720
that sense this book makes it all fairly

862
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,330
easy to break it

863
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,129
luckily we got more of these so we got

864
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,600
the data storage and privacy

865
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,620
requirements where we can do similar

866
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:27,650
stuff with one that is particularly

867
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,779
interesting of course is doing an IPC

868
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:32,180
mechanism check with intense or effect

869
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,650
extensions but I figured it we better if

870
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:36,799
you test it yourself because otherwise

871
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:39,500
we might run out of time do you have any

872
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:43,120
questions about what you just saw in

873
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:50,540
terms of touch ID yeah go ahead please

874
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:53,569
I'm sorry for Mike so the snapchat

875
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:57,440
sample app you should was it written in

876
00:35:53,570 --> 00:36:01,100
objective-c or Swift this was a demo

877
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,360
operating in Objective C I believe what

878
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,730
we can do the same thing with a Swiss

879
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,640
tap okay you with Freda you can replace

880
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:10,700
implementation of either objective-c or

881
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,319
Swift that's the nice part right now

882
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:15,950
even though you have on a higher level

883
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,710
you use Swift so then it's not doable to

884
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:21,710
do methods fizzling where the finger

885
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,890
relies on but it's still using lower

886
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:27,860
level API switch still use Objective C

887
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:30,170
yeah okay so it's really hard still to

888
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:34,900
do swing or impossible in Swift right

889
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:34,900
yeah that's not very doable thank you

890
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,989
[Music]

891
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:53,400
so the question is do we have a good

892
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:56,830
implementation of the proper one let me

893
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,690
okay we got if we have examples in mcg

894
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:00,880
if we have time left please hold on to

895
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,350
this question I can show it and we can

896
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,040
run through it

897
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:07,900
so this is it's good to show how not to

898
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,000
do this you just show this developers

899
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,760
don't do it like this but you also need

900
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,980
to tell developers this is the right way

901
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,160
of doing it and this is why yeah so

902
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,930
that's luckily in the MCG so we show how

903
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,640
to do it in that sense we show - which

904
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:24,540
flex you should look for and where it's

905
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,740
explained well enough to follow

906
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:29,230
obviously we just had to update it's

907
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:31,930
this week because we were behind ones

908
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:35,110
fifth version in terms of so the whole

909
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:37,390
flag naming got different but yeah

910
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:39,700
that's we try to make sure that it's

911
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:41,410
also clear what you have to do in

912
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,569
otherwise we give enough hints for a

913
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:44,890
developer so he knows what to look for

914
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:48,400
when he looks for an example where we

915
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:54,220
direct them to any other questions about

916
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:58,030
what we just saw - now all right cool so

917
00:37:54,220 --> 00:38:00,009
let's continue so there is a lot more

918
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:02,590
that we won't cover right now we got

919
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,480
reverse engineering in terms of routes

920
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:06,880
and geo brake detection anti debugging

921
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,000
anti reverse engineering tools emulator

922
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,970
detection memory integrate integrity

923
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,630
checks device binding obfuscation even

924
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:17,980
way more storage cryptography local

925
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,440
authentication Network communication

926
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,460
platform interaction code building built

927
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,050
settings because there's a lot of

928
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:26,560
freebies you get from the platform

929
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:28,990
vendors to do stuff right and with this

930
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,930
we believe you can make mobile security

931
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:34,779
actually simple it doesn't have to be

932
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:37,270
hard as long as you persist and read

933
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,680
basically I know this is a lot to read

934
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,720
through and I don't think you should

935
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:44,529
ever go through it just like that unless

936
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,049
you really like it but going after the

937
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:49,330
controls you think is valuable and

938
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:52,570
reading up on those carefully can really

939
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,519
help you to do stuff right luckily there

940
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,469
is a lot of part

941
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,658
if that have gone through the MCG and

942
00:38:55,469 --> 00:39:00,449
actually set up training programs and if

943
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:02,640
you want to just use those we don't fit

944
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:05,729
any of those programs we don't look at

945
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,249
them but you can ask and check with the

946
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:10,140
MCG in your hand if it's done well and

947
00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:12,058
at least you get 10 examples by a

948
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,348
training cuz we understand that going

949
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:16,109
through all the material might be hard

950
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:19,769
and this might be an alternative in the

951
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:22,319
end I still need you guys all of you to

952
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:24,658
help us to the next level at some point

953
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:29,399
just a week ago we went we had a total

954
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:31,649
open issues of 105 that's a lot because

955
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:33,449
we want to do this right so we keep on

956
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:36,598
evolving luckily we're now somewhere

957
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:38,339
around 90 but there's still plenty of

958
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:43,829
space to pick up so if you're interested

959
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:50,519
come join us and work with the stuff any

960
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:55,799
other questions ok I believe we have

961
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:58,198
some time left right so if you want to

962
00:39:55,799 --> 00:40:00,239
actually know we have about five minutes

963
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:05,609
here about five myths who wants to see

964
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:10,169
some Android demos because I yeah all

965
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:11,578
right let me see so remember we talked

966
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:16,769
about the SSL pinning and we were met

967
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:19,439
and we talked about the hacking

968
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:20,788
playground so this is an example of the

969
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:26,339
hacking playground that we implemented

970
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:29,399
this is opening so when you try to

971
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:30,839
connect basically we give the hint you

972
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:32,519
should see something over there

973
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:42,599
if you don't see something something's

974
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:45,419
awfully off so there's nothing right so

975
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,979
now we're using objection and given that

976
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:49,469
it's a emulator you have to basically

977
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:51,888
give the gadgets of the running app

978
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:53,969
that's running you can see this

979
00:40:51,889 --> 00:40:57,989
otherwise you might have to do it live

980
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:59,759
so you're basically saying Android this

981
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:03,049
is out pinning in it disabled so now it

982
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:03,049
should be disabled so if you click again

983
00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:08,350
you get data

984
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:11,680
so most of the pinning strategies used

985
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:14,830
in Android still use known implement the

986
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,990
known implementation methods and now

987
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,930
it's very easy to bypass or just patch

988
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:22,660
which by the way is not a motivation

989
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:24,970
from me to you guys to implement your

990
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,680
own Pinner that's not the idea of this

991
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,870
because implementing your own pin areas

992
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,669
can be hard and you can often make

993
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:33,069
mistakes so it's easier to use a library

994
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,690
which indeed can be bypassed but is

995
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,370
having some because the moment you start

996
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,870
implementing it herself while the field

997
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,430
is kneeled to you it's easy to make

998
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:47,140
mistakes in terms of what you should be

999
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:50,529
into how to do it etc so similarly we

1000
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:58,690
can do this if expose so again the same

1001
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:59,950
device or emulator so as you can see we

1002
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,800
don't see anything over there so nothing

1003
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:06,490
is happening

1004
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:08,110
so we switch to exposed and there

1005
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,549
there's a bunch of modules you can use

1006
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:13,960
and expose the one that we've been using

1007
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:16,510
this time is oh it's a bit blurry sorry

1008
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,370
it's just trust me that's what we saw is

1009
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:21,040
a pretty reliable module it also works

1010
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:25,930
for ok HSB 3 which is also used for

1011
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:27,580
handling HTTP connections yeah

1012
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:30,120
it's because we're using an emulator

1013
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:32,080
this is a big Frenchy from time to time

1014
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,700
by the way that's something you have to

1015
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,040
prepare for if you do this stuff with an

1016
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:38,200
emulator bring a big device to run it on

1017
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,900
and be prepared for crashing from time

1018
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:45,250
to time but still for the ease of

1019
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:47,080
recording that's what we did it so now

1020
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:49,090
you can see because we enabled it

1021
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,650
everything is being intercepted but she

1022
00:42:49,090 --> 00:43:02,620
sent by the application or operating

1023
00:42:50,650 --> 00:43:03,940
system so now if we so now the request

1024
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:06,040
comes through and this is the funny part

1025
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:08,980
as you see it took a while before the

1026
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:11,380
data popped in when you use exposed on

1027
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:13,210
modern Android versions you often get

1028
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,610
out delays which I can totally explain

1029
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,880
because we didn't dive into it so be a

1030
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,880
bit

1031
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,560
patient when you when you use this but

1032
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:24,870
as you can see an objection it was a bit

1033
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,160
faster in that sense so those are the

1034
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:30,180
demos for Android any other questions

1035
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,850
yes sir in the back

1036
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,850
oh yeah can I repeat the questions well

1037
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:40,589
if pinning really widely used in the

1038
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:43,710
mobile world because in the browser

1039
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:46,860
would Chrome deprecated it Firefox in

1040
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:48,780
the oppressor supported yes so it is

1041
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,310
widely used but there's a difference in

1042
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,260
the pinning maybe we should go there

1043
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:55,230
once more because the pinning you

1044
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:57,390
referring to actually there's so the

1045
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,250
pinning you're referring to is HP KP

1046
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:00,870
which stands for HTTP public key pinning

1047
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,030
which basically means sending a header

1048
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:04,529
with the thumb of the certificate saying

1049
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,050
this is what thou shalt pin to and

1050
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:10,500
people are easily able to break down and

1051
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:12,630
to flood the cache etc but here the pin

1052
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,240
is actually hard-coded within the app so

1053
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,860
we don't modify it get all the pins

1054
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,600
programmatically like HP KP but you pre

1055
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,910
program them basically so the

1056
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:23,250
certificate or hopefully the public key

1057
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:25,259
is hard-coded in the app yeah but the

1058
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:28,110
reason why it was deprecated is because

1059
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:34,800
web server maintained us didn't manage

1060
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:36,990
to to deal with the the keys properly so

1061
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,690
a lot of people shoot themselves in the

1062
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:42,060
foot so yeah the reason could be the

1063
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:44,130
same on the mobile world yeah we see the

1064
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,810
same thing going on unfortunately so

1065
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:48,120
there's a bunch of other requirements

1066
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,710
about having a proper update mechanism

1067
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,720
and a proper version whitelisting in

1068
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:53,280
your app so if you're sure it's event

1069
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,020
you end up with the right public keys if

1070
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,630
you put it all together and mcg guides

1071
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:59,430
you on doing so but in the end that

1072
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:02,010
remains a hard job so that's why it's an

1073
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:04,560
l2 requirement so many apps that don't

1074
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:06,360
necessarily need to pin don't shouldn't

1075
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,270
pin because then you have the hard time

1076
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,710
of managing your certificates or

1077
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,970
actually the private keys that belong to

1078
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,830
them

1079
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:17,339
but if there's really risk involved and

1080
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:19,200
this can really help all right so I just

1081
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:22,310
got the time up signal thank you very

1082
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,310
much for attending my talk
