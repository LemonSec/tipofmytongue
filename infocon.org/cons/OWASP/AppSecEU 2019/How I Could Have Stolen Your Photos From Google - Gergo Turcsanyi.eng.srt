1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,879
so hi everybody

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:12,579
let me start with two important things

3
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:14,469
first I'm I'm not a native speaker so if

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:16,840
you think my promising is bad or if you

5
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:21,580
don't understand anything just feel free

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:24,490
to stop me really and and ii do not

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:27,970
expect some DEFCON finalist level deep

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,729
exploitation stuff i just want to tell

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:34,680
how I started my back wanted carrier and

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:38,440
I think the motivation the logic and

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:42,430
emotions are nearly as important as the

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:45,510
technical details of the bug so I will

13
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,510
tell you about that

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:56,190
Who am I I'm a I go to China I'm from

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:01:00,459
Hungary four years ago I was just a

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:03,750
student at the University I always loved

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,369
hacking and wanted to be a hacker but

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,350
ever just the script killing to be

19
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:12,850
honest I I couldn't even use scripts or

20
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,530
Linux just use some tools in Windows

21
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:19,298
with graphical user graphical user

22
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:22,000
interface but then I started to learn

23
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:25,990
bhagwanti write-ups and started to work

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,439
for a company called avato I'm not here

25
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:32,169
for advertising but my job was there is

26
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,990
to to create IT security challenges so

27
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:38,649
that's what I'm doing for almost four

28
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:40,960
four five years now and I have created

29
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:43,299
more than hundred IT security challenges

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,389
since which really helped me a lot to

31
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:50,890
learn and I think I'm starting to

32
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:55,719
develop a hacker mindset which helped me

33
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:58,180
finding these bugs yeah table of

34
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,309
contents so I will talk about three

35
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,100
totally different and and hopefully

36
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:07,210
interesting bugs in this talk let's

37
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:10,389
start with the first one okay it all

38
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,739
started in on a regular workday I was

39
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:14,329
sitting in front of my computer

40
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,750
and a professor from the University

41
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:21,670
asked me to to send him a share

42
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:24,170
spreadsheet with him and I used his

43
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,179
email address with which belong to the

44
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,760
university so it wasn't the Gmail one

45
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,610
and send him the link of the spreadsheet

46
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,679
and he couldn't open it of course

47
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,500
because it's it was charged the wrong

48
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,110
email address but Google is really - in

49
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:42,050
this case and when he tried to open up

50
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,210
the spreadsheet Google shoved him this

51
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,340
error message and there was a request

52
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:52,640
access button when he clicked the button

53
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:55,460
Google sent me an email with a link that

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,089
this person wants to access my document

55
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:02,960
click here - to share it with him and

56
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:06,620
when I clicked it the document loaded

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,780
and this this sharing model appeared in

58
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,360
front of the document

59
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:14,210
I'm sure you're familiar with it if you

60
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,820
have ever used Google Docs and that was

61
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:22,730
the URL and yeah so there's basically

62
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:27,920
user input is reflected on the page from

63
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:31,399
the URL who thinks it to have an XSS no

64
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,380
one really that's what my does that was

65
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,370
my first tag that it it's clearly an

66
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:40,570
exercise but my second thought was no

67
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:44,030
way it's it's too good to be true if if

68
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:47,329
I have really brought lots of write-ups

69
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:50,330
from accessing Google and they are much

70
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,640
harder to find so to be honest I haven't

71
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:57,290
even tried to insert access payloads in

72
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,790
this parameter but maybe you've noticed

73
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:03,640
that the name of the parameter is not

74
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:07,850
user to invite but it users to invite so

75
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:12,679
maybe you can use this parameter to

76
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:14,000
invite multiple users at once right yeah

77
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,959
and and it looks like less known

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,630
parameter so I started to play with it

79
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,539
and it wasn't hard to figure it out that

80
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:25,909
if I insert multiple email addresses

81
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:28,759
separated with commas then they will

82
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,770
appear in the form next to each other so

83
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:36,139
it worked like addressing emails you

84
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:39,258
know and so if it works like addressing

85
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:43,280
emails then maybe I can specify a

86
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:49,940
display name using this format so that's

87
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:53,869
what I did and it was a success so it

88
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,880
looked like this and then I started to

89
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:59,810
think that maybe I can do some evil

90
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,969
things with this this hidden feature so

91
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,340
I specified the display name which which

92
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,750
looked lighter looked like an email

93
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:10,489
address so I could have crafted a

94
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:14,449
malicious link and if I sent sent it to

95
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:17,360
a document owner he only sees he only

96
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:19,220
sees the innocent gmail.com and the

97
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,259
attacker at gmail.com means is displayed

98
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,050
only when he moves his mouth over the

99
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:27,080
the email address I thought it was fun

100
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,180
and and maybe Google appreciated but I

101
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:35,330
wasn't sure it it will be concerned the

102
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:40,180
security issue but it was I got five

103
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:44,270
hundred dollars for that in 2017 so I

104
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:47,750
was really happy I found the security

105
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:49,280
bug in Google by accident so yeah that

106
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:59,599
that was one of the best days of my life

107
00:05:49,280 --> 00:06:02,359
and yep it's okay I found a security

108
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:04,190
issue but I can't can't brag about it

109
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,530
because it's when I when I throw the

110
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:13,070
details the tactical details they were

111
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:15,049
not not so deep so I felt that I could

112
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,449
do much better what happens if I try to

113
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:22,520
find vulnerabilities maybe maybe I can

114
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:24,339
find maybe I can find a better ones so

115
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,210
that's what I did

116
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:30,219
but I always imagined that bug bounty

117
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,878
hunters and just clicking their tools

118
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:35,889
running out attic scans so if there were

119
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,619
any bugs in Google that could be found

120
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:42,639
with security scanners and tools then

121
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:44,649
maybe then then they are already found

122
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,389
so I wanted to try something different

123
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:54,430
I and first I wanted to understand how

124
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:58,779
Google works under the hood so that's

125
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:01,050
what I did I I made a list all of the

126
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:04,990
Google products I have found online and

127
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,909
opened the developer tools because I

128
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,330
really like that chrome developer tools

129
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:12,580
especially the network tab and since I'm

130
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,159
usually creating web security challenges

131
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,818
I am familiar with the basic concepts of

132
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:20,949
web like same origin policy cross-origin

133
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:23,860
resource sharing cross-site script

134
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:26,080
inclusion and stuff like that so I just

135
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,580
started to look for anything like

136
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,990
anything valuable I have checked all the

137
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,669
all the Google products I have found I

138
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:39,219
spent nights afternoons lots of time

139
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:41,889
looking for vulnerabilities but it

140
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:45,099
turned out that finding bugs in Google

141
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:48,370
in heart is hard so I haven't found

142
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:52,319
anything but my initial research results

143
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:56,080
showed that Google Drive and Google Docs

144
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,050
are really complex applications with

145
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,959
lots of features buttons API requests

146
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,909
and I know that they're really popular

147
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:07,870
so lots of companies using them for

148
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:10,629
storing company secrets sensitive

149
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:14,580
documents so finding a bug in Google

150
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:18,669
Drive or Google Docs would be cool and

151
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:21,128
yeah the results show that Google slides

152
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:23,740
is part of the Google Docs family but

153
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:26,409
it's it has slightly different API

154
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:30,490
endpoints and and features so I fight it

155
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:33,140
it contains some legacy code so answer I

156
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,709
started to focus on on slides

157
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:42,189
and eventually I have found the direct

158
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:43,669
object reference in Google slides and I

159
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,810
created them

160
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:57,649
CTF challenge based on this this bug let

161
00:08:47,810 --> 00:09:04,939
me show you okay so here someone posted

162
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:07,970
on a screenshot of his private key

163
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:11,120
uploaded to to his drive you can see the

164
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,920
the ID of the picture but you can see

165
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,560
them in the middle of the the private

166
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:22,610
key and your task is to to get the the

167
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:25,339
uncensored picture from his Drive this

168
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:30,140
this application is not on Google size

169
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:34,790
replica just guestbook where you can

170
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:38,360
like pictures and posts but it is a

171
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:46,819
drive functionality so let's upload the

172
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:48,829
picture it's my favorite microwave so

173
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,190
let's see a classical direct object

174
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:54,649
reference where we just copy down the

175
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:58,760
idea of this this image and try to

176
00:09:54,649 --> 00:10:00,500
replace with ours of course it's not

177
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,329
working it's it's Google they now have

178
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:08,029
to write secure code but in Google

179
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:10,910
slides you could insert pictures into

180
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:14,600
the presentation from your computer from

181
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:19,370
your drive from URL and the issue was in

182
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:23,170
the insert from Drive feature because

183
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:26,350
when you select the picture you send

184
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:33,229
requests to two different API endpoints

185
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:33,660
copy images and run their data in the

186
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:39,240
first

187
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:41,910
request you send the idea of your image

188
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,970
in the as a get parameter and so for

189
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:48,839
post parameter as well the the get

190
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:51,480
parameter doesn't matter here but it was

191
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,030
there in the Google slides so I have

192
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:58,500
included it in my challenge so let's

193
00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:03,720
just focus on the the post data and in

194
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:05,970
the response there is also the the idea

195
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,040
of the image and some random string I

196
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:11,010
had no idea what this random string

197
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,670
means so I just moved to the next

198
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:20,310
request which contained in the rest

199
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:24,959
response a direct URL of an image let's

200
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:27,390
see the the request maybe maybe you have

201
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,910
noticed that this random string we sent

202
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,370
to the second API endpoint is the same

203
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:36,990
random string we got from the disk copy

204
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:40,350
images response as you can see it's the

205
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:44,660
same and this this picture in the

206
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:48,710
response is the precious microwave

207
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:54,060
so let's replay this rec requests but

208
00:11:48,710 --> 00:12:00,620
replace these this image ID with the one

209
00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:02,609
we want to access so as I said I'm I

210
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,350
don't really prefer tools

211
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:08,700
so I'm using notepad and and and curl

212
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:20,720
but hey that that's what worked for me

213
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:20,720
and so here is the ID we replace that

214
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:28,500
and if you replay the requested curl

215
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:34,040
then we get down this a new random

216
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,040
string let's move to the second request

217
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,470
[Music]

218
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:42,640
copy the random string here from here

219
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:47,500
and

220
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:55,689
inserted them and replayed in the second

221
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:59,709
one we got a aur of an image and if you

222
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:03,420
visit it that will be the the uncensored

223
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:08,619
picture and and it was in Google slides

224
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:11,140
so if you had an image of Google then if

225
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:14,709
you had the idea of an image from a

226
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:18,910
Google Drive then I could access it from

227
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:24,359
any image and I think it would be it's

228
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:28,329
cool so I have reported to Google and

229
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,970
they classified it as a priority one but

230
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:35,620
it's it's the highest priority and they

231
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:38,279
gave us another $500 bounty I thought

232
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:41,980
it's a little bit low but to be honest

233
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:45,970
yeah it's a direct object reference but

234
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:48,430
I explained for myself that these image

235
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:50,949
IDs in Google driver really long

236
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:54,670
case-sensitive random strings so

237
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:57,099
theoretically I could have still any

238
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,800
photo but I had to brute force the these

239
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:03,190
IDs first so I'm not sure if it was

240
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:07,359
really exploitable but they gave money

241
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:12,399
for that I was and it could be end of

242
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,829
the story because I have found a more

243
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,620
complex security issue in Google its

244
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:21,099
technical and tricky one so I was really

245
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,750
proud proud of myself satisfied I can

246
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,720
find an brag about that I have found

247
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:29,310
I have hagu Google twice so yeah I

248
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,690
realized it and at the same time I I

249
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:35,859
lost all my motivation to find another

250
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:39,130
bugs because I realized it this one and

251
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:42,850
I felt that I have used all my luck for

252
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:44,949
for the lifetime so I haven't even tried

253
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:50,529
to to hunt anymore

254
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:52,870
I just just set for a few months and it

255
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:54,660
all changed when one of my friends

256
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,030
mentioned that

257
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,900
Google started decided abdomens I'm not

258
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:04,220
sure if you remember that or but he told

259
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:07,350
me that they're doing it and that he's

260
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,110
buying some cool ones to decide them

261
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:13,830
later I wasn't really interested because

262
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:18,630
I I have never bought any domains but

263
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:20,790
finally I gave to try and try to look

264
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:23,550
for interesting domains of course all

265
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:26,099
the short ones were taken so I started

266
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:28,890
to look for names of big companies like

267
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,980
Microsoft that app Facebook tab and and

268
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,210
so on and eventually I find the one

269
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,680
which was available

270
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:39,960
Cohen based tap it Cohen basis own huge

271
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,640
cube the currency exchange so they have

272
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,890
money so it looked like a good

273
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,800
investment to to buy coin based on other

274
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:50,130
coin based that AB domain so that's what

275
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,079
I try to do I have registered entered my

276
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:55,020
credit card details type really really

277
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:58,110
fast but and they have even charge my

278
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,870
card but at the end of the process it

279
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:04,140
failed and the website said that it was

280
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:06,810
already taken so someone was few seconds

281
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:11,939
faster than me I'm sure they have

282
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:13,439
monitored the DNS requests but I'm not

283
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:17,310
sure if I can describe that feeling but

284
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,740
I was really angry disappointed and sad

285
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:25,859
at the same time just try to imagine

286
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:28,190
that but yeah at the same time it made

287
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,870
me realize that I had way more success

288
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:36,780
hacking Google than buying and selling

289
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:42,060
domains so I went home sat down to my

290
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:44,610
computer and try to find a new bug on my

291
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:47,609
first run I have somehow skip go Google

292
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:52,260
photos I don't know why but I haven't

293
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:54,750
found it so this time I focused on on

294
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,030
Google photos with the same old method

295
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:00,300
analyzing requests on Google developer

296
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:01,709
developer tools and I have fun nothing

297
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,188
interesting

298
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:07,740
for a while until I came across to this

299
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:10,290
shared libraries feature which sounds

300
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,730
cool but it's just it means just you can

301
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:16,770
share your google photos with someone

302
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:19,260
else with a partner account and it works

303
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:23,819
like that you you enter the email

304
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:27,179
address of your partner click the share

305
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:30,110
button and there will be a pop-up window

306
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:33,000
with a legit Google login screen and

307
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:36,389
when you log in your photos are inst

308
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
instantly shared and all you can see is

309
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,610
a success message and their close window

310
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,890
button it looks it looked really weird

311
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:50,520
to me so and URL I couldn't see the holy

312
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:55,050
water because then the window was really

313
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:59,070
small so I have copied it and it looked

314
00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:02,129
like this the the first two parameters

315
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:04,230
are just random numbers not really

316
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:09,390
interesting but the third one the

317
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:14,450
continue is is clearly a URL so let's

318
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,450
take let's decode it and and take a look

319
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:22,470
yeah so if we you already coded it looks

320
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:34,909
like this do you notice anything strange

321
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:37,490
oh it's just random string right this

322
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:42,240
yeah it would be valid basics before

323
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:45,660
thing but there is no equal sign just a

324
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,150
dot so this dot was made me thinking

325
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,610
that it looks like padding and if it was

326
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:54,770
a an equal sign then it will be valid

327
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:57,270
based sixty-four string so I try to

328
00:18:54,770 --> 00:19:05,309
decode it after changing the dot to

329
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:10,650
equal sign and yeah it's a success I saw

330
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:13,350
so many random staff in this base64

331
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,840
thing and the most important is the

332
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:18,980
email address of the

333
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:21,980
selected partner account and other other

334
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,290
parameters I'm still not sure what are

335
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,290
they doing here I thought they are

336
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:30,020
identifying your photo album but turned

337
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:32,659
out they're not the only important

338
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:36,620
string here is the email address of your

339
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:42,020
partner account so I changed it to

340
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:45,020
attacker at gmail.com encoded this this

341
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:51,080
whole text change them equal sign to a

342
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:53,629
dot and crafted on a link and if I visit

343
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,199
I sent it to my other account visited it

344
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:59,570
logged in I saw a success message and my

345
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,970
photos were shot with the attacker it's

346
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:13,970
cool right that's what I did let me show

347
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:16,430
you in action it will be the same

348
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:22,250
application with a new photo sharing

349
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:33,350
feature let's register an attacker

350
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:37,310
account first ok here is my tribe I can

351
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:39,199
share pictures with a friend icons their

352
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:42,560
admin my friends so I'm showing my

353
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:50,690
pictures with her with him let's copy

354
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:54,290
the URL yeah as you can see there is

355
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:57,050
this this long base64 encoded string at

356
00:20:54,290 --> 00:21:07,790
the end of the URL it's not exactly the

357
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:10,970
same but yeah let's decode it

358
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:14,100
[Music]

359
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,780
as I'm using user names instead of email

360
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,300
addresses in this challenge to to make

361
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:26,250
it simple let's change them they

362
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:35,760
username to ours copy this text and code

363
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:39,570
it again change the equal signs and and

364
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:45,270
we have crafted a malicious URL now we

365
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:52,439
have to send it to someone let's create

366
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:55,260
a victim account okay we have our nice

367
00:21:52,440 --> 00:22:00,180
Drive we're uploading pictures

368
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:02,820
microwaves and once of our friend sends

369
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:07,010
us a link we are opening it

370
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:10,830
oh it's so it's legit like login screen

371
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:13,290
so let's login we see a success message

372
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:16,500
in the close window button and we don't

373
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:18,960
understand what happened because Google

374
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,900
hasn't said what happened yeah I haven't

375
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:29,430
even got an email from it four days that

376
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:41,220
my photos were shared with someone but

377
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:43,650
they were so it was a a more expensive

378
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,170
honorabie tea I got more than three

379
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:51,120
thousand dollars for that and it was

380
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:55,890
also that I a spirit Priority One so

381
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:59,870
yeah that's the end of the story now to

382
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,870
be honest last week I found a new one

383
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:06,360
but I can't really talk about the

384
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:10,289
technical details yet lessons learned

385
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:13,498
for me you you don't have to be a rocket

386
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:15,360
scientist I see really interesting

387
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:18,299
presentations there are already smart

388
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,539
people here but I bet there are a lot of

389
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:23,220
beginners who want to start finding bugs

390
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:27,450
and want to start participating in

391
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:32,159
bhagwanti programs so just do it guys

392
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:34,259
give it give it a try analyzing stuff

393
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:39,480
manually work for me but I'm not saying

394
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:41,460
that using to this bed and yeah one of

395
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,789
the most important things is that the be

396
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,619
creative don't just go out and say that

397
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:50,639
oh I will try to find an SQL injection

398
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:54,600
in this application because probably you

399
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:55,830
want instead you you should try to

400
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:01,289
understand how this web application

401
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:04,559
works try to find hidden features and be

402
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:07,860
creative and even and if you can

403
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:10,200
creatively misuse the features then and

404
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:15,360
and do evil things then they will pay

405
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:17,249
for it and as a defender of course you

406
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,320
should sanitize and validate user input

407
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:27,090
because that's the the root cause of

408
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:29,189
most of the issues so yeah basically

409
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:33,860
that's what I wanted to say if you have

410
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,860
any questions I'm here

411
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:44,140
thank you very much so if there are any

412
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:47,310
questions please raise your hand because

413
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,310
the microphone is over here now

414
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,169
questions about the security of Google

415
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:57,010
interesting interesting

416
00:24:53,170 --> 00:25:00,040
so you had mostly we're a direct topic

417
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:03,010
reference or insufficient context

418
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,110
validation well if you say sanitized

419
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:07,570
your input people mostly think of the

420
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:11,560
technical doesn't match the format and

421
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:14,530
such where do you suppose that the

422
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:18,610
validation on the business level or the

423
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:21,730
logic should actually take place in the

424
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:24,850
second one orbitty it was that those API

425
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:29,050
endpoints who are clearly not not

426
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:30,939
protected enough but yeah and in the

427
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:33,580
first one orbitty sanitizing your

428
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,970
sanitizing the input and and what dating

429
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,730
it would have could have world.the this

430
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:44,830
third one is is I think it's mostly a

431
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:49,570
design issue so yeah what did they think

432
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:52,929
isn't isn't working here but it works in

433
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:55,480
most of the cases so if you're not

434
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:57,940
Google then sanitizing and all editing

435
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:02,380
your input should be enough for for a

436
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:06,040
long time but yeah there are logic

437
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:10,360
logical and another types of bugs of as

438
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:14,290
well okay so the last vulnerability you

439
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,090
said we have you log in you have secured

440
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:18,520
message what if someone was already

441
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:22,600
authenticated who did see that success

442
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:27,550
message directly or no this login screen

443
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:30,459
always appeared and I I forgot to forgot

444
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:34,030
to try them so that there was a you

445
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:36,700
around in the indicate parameter and I

446
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:39,820
forgot to test it to directly visit that

447
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:43,840
URL maybe it could have worked maybe not

448
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:46,290
but I haven't tested unfortunately it

449
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,290
would be cool it could be a one-click

450
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:53,440
photo stealing but

451
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:56,340
yeah I missed it okay who wants a quick

452
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,340
3,000 bucks

453
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:06,129
did you actually have to argue with this

454
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:08,560
Google security engineer that this those

455
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:12,010
bugs are actually the box or they just

456
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:16,570
accepted those and just gave you the

457
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:18,670
bounty they accepted it I have my new

458
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:21,159
reporting bugs to Google or anyone you

459
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:23,890
have to to write down a legit attack

460
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,710
scenario so if you write a good one and

461
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:28,810
you can explain them the issue clearly

462
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,470
then they will accept it with that

463
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,440
question

464
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:34,000
so yeah they liked it that's up except

465
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:39,060
to the plan and have no questions about

466
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,060
it okay thanks thanks

467
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:49,320
any other questions boring everybody's

468
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:52,740
tired of to a press conference already

469
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:55,780
okay questions going once going twice

470
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,700
in that case Joe Joe thank you very much

471
