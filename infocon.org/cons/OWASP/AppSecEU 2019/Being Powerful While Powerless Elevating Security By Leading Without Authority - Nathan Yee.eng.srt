1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:11,599
hi everyone I'm Nathan I am here so try

2
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:14,269
jet lag coming from San Francisco when

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,190
it's like 5:00 a.m. so we're gonna see

4
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:20,300
how this goes but yeah thanks

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:22,610
introduction super happy to be here

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,880
I worked at a company called gusto based

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:29,480
in San Francisco we are a company that

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:32,809
is a people platform for payroll

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,559
benefits and more so I was the first

10
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:39,858
application security engineer at gusto

11
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:44,149
and then for actually I'm open as well I

12
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:50,030
was the only member of the security team

13
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:53,179
a lot of my co-workers and friends

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,940
thought that it was super cool that I

15
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:59,300
was the only person on the security team

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,059
they thought I had a ton of power and I

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,449
could do whatever I wanted

18
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:11,329
spoiler alert had no power and couldn't

19
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:13,520
do anything naturally they were also

20
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:16,429
curious to see what my did a day

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,310
entailed what responsibilities I had

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:25,310
what I had to do again as the only

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:28,880
member on the security team so after

24
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:31,789
giving them a rundown of what my

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,240
day-to-day entailed then they actually

26
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:40,280
realized how much work is really

27
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:43,689
involved and how it is just a ton of

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:49,369
responsibility to secure a company

29
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:54,350
basically by yourself as a individual

30
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:56,990
contributor with effectively no power so

31
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:00,919
now I want to take a step back and kind

32
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:04,219
of talk about what was up against me and

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,549
what I was facing so here as this

34
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:10,250
picture shows I was quite in over my

35
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:13,970
head I had a lot of things not in my

36
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:18,530
favor so first off

37
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:22,970
I was outnumbered by the engineers 1 to

38
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:25,490
a big number I think it was like 100 or

39
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,380
150 so you can imagine how much code

40
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:32,780
they were pushing out every single day

41
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:35,359
just myself there I worked or working at

42
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,620
a startup and for those you who are set

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,000
up you know that there are ever-changing

44
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:43,460
priorities with management wanting this

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,320
one day and then kind of shifting to a

46
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,209
whole different thing the next day and

47
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,480
then you imagine what that entails again

48
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:53,590
for security a lot of different new risk

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,350
popping up from these new ventures and

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:00,680
then finally again I was in individual

51
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,290
contributor so I was not AC so I was not

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,340
a director of security I was just an IC

53
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:12,799
on the security team tasked with leading

54
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:16,790
security effectively forgot still so the

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,980
fixed input was my time I only had a

56
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,190
certain number of hours per day and I

57
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:27,260
loved to sleep so in order to balance

58
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:31,420
sleep also trying to run security I had

59
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:34,970
to somehow find a way to amplify myself

60
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:41,450
across the whole company for engineers

61
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:43,549
and non-engineers alike now I want to go

62
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:49,130
over a few of the technical strategies

63
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:52,880
that I used again to maximize my output

64
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:56,209
given the limited time input so given

65
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,820
this input what can I do to make myself

66
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:03,700
present across nearly the whole company

67
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:05,140
I think a lot

68
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:10,410
you here in this room are very familiar

69
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:15,129
with the idea of shifting left right so

70
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:18,339
this is not a new concept but I think I

71
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:21,488
want to emphasize how much more

72
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:25,479
important it is given the position I was

73
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:27,729
in to shift or even there's a newer term

74
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,400
called push left which is pushing

75
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:34,349
security at the forefront not just

76
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:38,349
shifting it is up more forceful action

77
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:47,070
so one thing that does scale really well

78
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:50,889
is software being able there you go

79
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:53,800
being able to write code is incredibly

80
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:57,120
powerful not sure if anyone has seen

81
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:01,060
Dino daizo V's blackhat keynote this

82
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,790
past summer but it was an incredible

83
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,340
presentation where he talked about how

84
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,530
modern-day security teams are most

85
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:12,638
effective when their engineers are able

86
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:15,489
to write code and I think as a former

87
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,850
software engineer I would fully agree

88
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:23,289
quite bias but being able to write code

89
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:24,910
and being able to speak the language to

90
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:30,150
the engineers and what they use everyday

91
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:35,680
is so so powerful I think one thing

92
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:38,380
which was not realized is that you gain

93
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,050
a lot of inherent respect from the

94
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:44,530
engineers by being able to build the

95
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:47,740
features for them or to push out poor

96
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:50,760
requests for bugs that come in through

97
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:54,849
either a pen test report or a bug bounty

98
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:57,760
so by being able to show them that you

99
00:05:54,849 --> 00:06:00,789
could effectively hang with them that

100
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,400
you can write code you will gain their

101
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:06,810
trust and then you can trust them as

102
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,810
well and it goes both ways

103
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:16,119
in also continuing along the same idea

104
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,940
it's important to automate anything

105
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,490
that's

106
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,330
pitiable and deterministic so one tool

107
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,360
that we use

108
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,969
Augusto is called danger I'm not sure if

109
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:33,200
anyone has used it but it's a fantastic

110
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:35,840
tool to allow myself to scale by being

111
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,420
able to keep eyes on different things so

112
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,299
one example here is that we use a tool

113
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:45,110
break down static code analysis Internet

114
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,330
gusto so we have a list of exceptions

115
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:51,470
which are false positives that are

116
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:53,539
thrown by the tool and if an engineer

117
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:56,900
tries to be sneaky and tries to throw it

118
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:59,660
in it's going to ping me from the github

119
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,520
pull requests again this means that I

120
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,730
myself don't have to go through every

121
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,590
single pull request that comes through

122
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:09,920
again you can imagine how many pull

123
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:14,450
requests are coming in every hour every

124
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:18,800
day so with my limited time I can use

125
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:23,200
software that's more powerful than I

126
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:27,080
will ever be to keep an eye out for me

127
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:31,280
and that's a great segue to my next

128
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:33,560
topic is that a code analysis very much

129
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,219
in the same way people have already

130
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:41,030
written tools to do what I would try to

131
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:44,419
do but would be slower and would be less

132
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:47,330
reliable so for looking for a sequel

133
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:49,460
injection or we're looking for an XSS

134
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,560
vulnerability I myself enough to go

135
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,169
through every single pull request I can

136
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,090
put this at the very forefront of the

137
00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:00,320
development process for the engineers

138
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:04,400
and they can have instant feedback I

139
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,440
think that's one thing that is that

140
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,599
might be overlooked by some of us

141
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,640
insecurity is how important instant

142
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,890
feedback is for the developers again

143
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,159
coming from the software engineering

144
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:21,349
background being able to instantly see

145
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:24,979
how here my pull request is if there's

146
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:28,400
some air this means that the engineers

147
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:30,340
aren't blocked by my time and that

148
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,159
they're able to proceed

149
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:40,360
by writing code as fast as they're able

150
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:44,199
to and then the next thing that was

151
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,390
super helpful in this process was using

152
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,290
software and tools for vulnerable

153
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:53,650
dependency management so I got a lot of

154
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:58,390
companies use open-source tools as part

155
00:08:53,650 --> 00:09:00,640
of their application that's great for

156
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:04,930
saving time but also it means that you

157
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,630
open up a lot of different vulnerability

158
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:09,310
or chances for a vulnerability given the

159
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,990
open source software that you're

160
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:15,849
effectively trusting as part of your

161
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:22,180
system so I could go through every

162
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:24,580
single gem file or package JSON and keep

163
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,260
an eye on all the dependencies but that

164
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,210
would take forever and there's no way

165
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,050
that I have this much time in the world

166
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,540
to look over it

167
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:35,140
to cross-reference what CVEs were

168
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:39,790
released yesterday so by using this tool

169
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:43,230
to automate to check and update packages

170
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:45,939
this saves an incredible amount of time

171
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,940
so I think one thing here's a common

172
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,810
theme among writing code doing static

173
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,070
code analysis and doing automatic

174
00:09:51,810 --> 00:10:01,420
vulnerability management is that this is

175
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:04,210
all doable because of software so in

176
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,969
order to amplify myself given a limited

177
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,760
time and to have the broadest reach

178
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:12,610
software was absolutely an incredible

179
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:16,060
tool in my arsenal to allow me to scale

180
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:19,360
myself and then like one more point on

181
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,760
that as well again is that I didn't need

182
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,790
any power I didn't need a heavy hammer

183
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,650
for this it's because through this

184
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,199
software it's very black and white it

185
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:31,660
shows the developers your code either is

186
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:36,790
secure or isn't secure so I don't have

187
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:38,589
to deal with any of the things that

188
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,110
could come associated with trying to

189
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,700
force someone to do it the evidence is

190
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,320
right there if there's sequel injection

191
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:48,430
you too will show you

192
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:51,030
and you have to fix it and now what kind

193
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:54,969
of moving a little further right is

194
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:58,209
pentesting so this is not necessarily

195
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,850
part of don't process this would occur

196
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:04,570
after the products have already shipped

197
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:07,600
and our launch but one thing that is

198
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:10,630
really helpful with this also hopefully

199
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,780
that you already are doing this as part

200
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:18,970
of an annual or even more frequent basis

201
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:21,850
is that you have a set of experts going

202
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:28,290
super deep into your code looking for

203
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:33,430
vulnerabilities with the source code so

204
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:37,540
having a pen test also has a few

205
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:40,479
unexpected benefits so for example let's

206
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:44,230
say that your company wants to create a

207
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,700
partnership with a different opening or

208
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,090
they want to integrate a different

209
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:51,340
platform oftentimes the other company

210
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:53,410
why have you fill out a really long

211
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,420
vendor review and for anyone who's done

212
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,600
a vendor review they're terrible

213
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,430
there are a thousand questions to answer

214
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,900
and what I found frequently is by

215
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:07,120
sending a pen test from a reputable pen

216
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,400
testing firm is that they'll accept it

217
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,940
to answer a lot of questions to just

218
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:15,970
show the security posture of your

219
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:19,560
organization and also you're able to

220
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:24,250
benchmark your overall security health

221
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:26,140
by comparing it from a test to tests

222
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,300
from year to year and hopefully you're

223
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,180
trending an upward direction we're

224
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:36,790
upward involves fewer vulnerabilities

225
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:39,489
and more secure code so data is the

226
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:46,060
ultimate truth and here you have hard

227
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:49,690
data and evidence of that and then also

228
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:55,689
similarly we have a bug bounty program

229
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:57,280
augusto given that it was just myself at

230
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,030
that time it would not have made sense

231
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,810
to

232
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:03,819
you use my limited time to do pen

233
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:06,400
testing even though it's a lot of fun I

234
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:10,170
really enjoy it it wasn't the best ROI

235
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,640
for my time so by being able to leverage

236
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,650
hundreds of researchers from all across

237
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,470
the world to have them constantly

238
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:20,290
probing at our system with hundreds of

239
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,130
eyes hundreds of methodologies hundreds

240
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,579
of perspectives

241
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:27,520
I have scaled myself through this

242
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:30,880
program to empower the other researchers

243
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:34,180
to poke around and hopefully find

244
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,400
vulnerabilities for me so by being able

245
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,979
to do pen testing and this bug my

246
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,069
theorem this is staff augmentation and

247
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:46,920
this has helped me to keep an eye on

248
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,920
code after it has launched and shipped

249
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,300
so I went over the technical strategies

250
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,339
but now I want to go over some of the

251
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:01,390
cultural ones these are more nuanced and

252
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,980
that could be are you maybe they're even

253
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,620
more important than some of the

254
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,640
technological things and I really had

255
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,690
prided myself on being able to build a

256
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,460
security conscious culture

257
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:18,220
Agosto and these are a few of the

258
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:20,320
strategies that I used so first off I

259
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,630
can't emphasize how important it is to

260
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,200
build relationships with different key

261
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:28,750
stakeholders at your company so these

262
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,590
are a few of the ones for myself Agosto

263
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:34,840
and note that other companies you might

264
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:37,090
have different stakeholders or different

265
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,880
groups but for some of the group stuff

266
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:42,400
worked well for me I'll go through some

267
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,040
of them the first one is IT you can

268
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,640
think of them as frontline security so

269
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:52,300
often times they get requests from our

270
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:55,270
employees if they see a we're pop-up in

271
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:58,030
their computer if the browser's acting

272
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:00,040
funny these could be security issues but

273
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:02,770
maybe the employees report them don't

274
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,860
necessarily know that so by having a

275
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:09,130
full IT Help Desk and support SAP ready

276
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:12,220
to keep eyes on anything security

277
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:15,160
related that in itself

278
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,260
from taking just myself and now

279
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,380
empowering the rest of the IT team to

280
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:23,319
look for this that's been huge legal and

281
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:26,560
compliance are also especially relevant

282
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:30,340
given the industry that were in with PII

283
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,560
mph I so ensuring that we're compliant

284
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:36,490
with the different laws and regulations

285
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:39,130
I know that you all have the GPR here we

286
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:42,490
have the CCPA coming up in California

287
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:44,860
next year so you can imagine with your

288
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:49,000
other companies with doing security how

289
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:51,220
important gdpr is so being able to work

290
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,930
with legal compliance I would imagine

291
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:58,270
for you all as well is huge one group

292
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,189
that surprised me how important and

293
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:03,010
powerful they were are the product

294
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:07,600
managers or the PM group so these are

295
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:09,520
the group of folks who create the

296
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,040
features that the engineers are building

297
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,720
so by partnering with the product

298
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,530
management team at the very very

299
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:22,300
beginning so this is shift left to the

300
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:26,589
extreme you are working with the PM

301
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:29,770
group to have eyes on anything that may

302
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:32,530
be secure lated so for any features that

303
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:38,260
may touch authentication or

304
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:38,860
authorization by having them keep you in

305
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,460
the loop

306
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,470
then you know that you're going to get

307
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:48,130
pretty much full coverage on every

308
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,540
feature and then finally engineering and

309
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,880
infrastructure I think these two are

310
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,860
pretty obvious the engineers are the

311
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,689
ones writing the code so by being able

312
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:00,040
to partner with them and to get them on

313
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:02,020
your side that's there's nothing more

314
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,449
powerful not and then finally

315
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,280
infrastructure these are the individuals

316
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:09,970
who are building your different networks

317
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,459
and systems and if your network systems

318
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,740
aren't secure then it's already game

319
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:20,439
over so you want them to be fully on

320
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:24,040
your side so I think a lot of you have

321
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,730
seen this picture that everything's okay

322
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,559
and I think

323
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,040
speaking from personal experience that a

324
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:31,490
lot of people and security just think

325
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,659
everything's okay

326
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:37,820
that it is what it is and there's not

327
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,790
much I can do about that but then I want

328
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:48,280
to tell you that this really is not the

329
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:54,129
case you should not be trying to hide it

330
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:56,899
coming from the development side getting

331
00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:03,350
transparency into what's going on on the

332
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:07,429
security side is so so important to get

333
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:10,549
the buy-in so the point here is I want

334
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:14,480
for you all to be authentic with the

335
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:16,700
engineers and non engineers alike share

336
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,100
the pen test report with them words

337
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,700
appropriate obviously share the bug

338
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:25,250
bounty findings by being able to show

339
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:29,059
them that you're vulnerable and that

340
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:31,820
you're willing to work with them you are

341
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:33,799
gaining trust with them and then

342
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,889
likewise you can trust them as well

343
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:42,139
when they have to fix issues or create

344
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:44,210
new tools and from what I've seen it's

345
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,160
from my experience others are really

346
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:48,169
willing to help if you want to bring

347
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,809
them in and if you want to show them

348
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:55,970
that security does want to help and it's

349
00:18:53,809 --> 00:19:02,780
not there just to block but rather it's

350
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:06,679
to empower the next thing is be

351
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:10,580
accessible so be open and be willing to

352
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:13,370
help others so while it was just myself

353
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:16,309
on the security team I made it a point

354
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:20,030
to eat lunch with nearly every single

355
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:22,580
team in some ways so throughout the week

356
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,379
one day it would be legal the next day

357
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,168
would be marketing the next day it would

358
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,450
be compliance so by being able to show

359
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:30,380
them that I'm not just off in some

360
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,570
corner

361
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,960
typing away that I want to be actually

362
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,500
with the company with the greater

363
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,120
population

364
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,860
it built inherent

365
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,489
poor with the different coworkers

366
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,899
and they also want to share another

367
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:51,480
story with you so there was one

368
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,450
individual who had a question with a

369
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,800
personal two factor authentication

370
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,090
account I think they were trying to add

371
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,180
some account but they were having some

372
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,050
issue again this is not my job

373
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,150
responsibility

374
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm not IT support I'm not trying to

375
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:11,100
help them fix their 2fa also this was

376
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,170
their personal 2fa so this was a

377
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,169
question of the home ok I guess I'm

378
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:19,260
gonna be your personal IT support now

379
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:21,450
the reason why I sure that is I think

380
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,940
about a month or two later there was a

381
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,730
pretty critical ask that I II needed of

382
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,520
this person so because I already had

383
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,920
helped with their initial ask that I

384
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:36,629
already had built the initial goodwill

385
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:39,870
and had deposited all the goodwill into

386
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:42,179
that account so security is much like a

387
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,370
bank once you make with a bunch of it

388
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:46,260
deposits there are times that you're

389
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,750
going to need withdrawals and you're

390
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,000
going to need favors so why not try to

391
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:59,090
build up the initial goodwill to make

392
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:05,030
the withdrawals as you see necessary and

393
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:10,050
then on a more tactical point for

394
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:14,450
security education I have seen a lot of

395
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:16,770
success come augusto by me being able to

396
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:19,920
give different classes for different

397
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:23,040
things so one of them is a security

398
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,350
civic class for engineering so I show

399
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,780
them a few of the web vulnerabilities go

400
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:35,879
over different tools in our pipeline

401
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:38,160
I see the main purpose of this for me

402
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,600
said not teach them what a sequel

403
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,809
injection is sure I give them initial

404
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:47,189
exposure but by me being able to put a

405
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:52,139
name to the face and then to show that

406
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:52,950
security is a real thing and then I make

407
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,660
myself

408
00:21:52,950 --> 00:22:00,770
out there I make myself visible so one

409
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:03,380
thing also to note is that by me

410
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:07,620
teaching this class

411
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:10,260
the ratio of my time invested to output

412
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:12,989
is pretty significant so with just

413
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:16,980
myself teaching in our class for example

414
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:19,980
I can reach 15 or 20 engineers Howard me

415
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,930
are joining for that star class so

416
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:28,280
that's a pretty great time investment

417
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:31,590
for that and then also I teach a

418
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,450
security phishing or I'm sorry phishing

419
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:36,179
training class with a follow-up campaign

420
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:39,630
so we do that every once in a while and

421
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:41,490
that ensures that security is very top

422
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:44,430
of mind for the different individuals

423
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:47,940
and again the point I want to drive home

424
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:50,850
is that by me teaching these classes it

425
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:58,770
amplifies myself and makes the greatest

426
00:22:50,850 --> 00:23:02,250
return on my time so now I want to show

427
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:05,639
you what happens when all of this works

428
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:08,820
right what happens when you slow

429
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:14,910
yourself successfully what happens when

430
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:19,379
you consider yourself successful so in

431
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:22,470
this example here I have this engineer

432
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,150
who reached out to me this person was

433
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:28,020
just you know poking around the system

434
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:31,230
playing and stumbled across a system

435
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:34,860
that should have been locked down a lot

436
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:37,680
tighter I think this is not a an

437
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,379
uncommon thing for engineers since

438
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,030
they're in the trenches did a day

439
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,510
playing with different tools they see

440
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:48,420
things so for this engineer to

441
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:51,420
proactively reach out and for us to

442
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:57,660
close this down that's a pretty huge win

443
00:23:51,420 --> 00:24:01,440
and this

444
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:05,820
here is not engineer but is in a

445
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,850
customer-facing role so they receive a

446
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:14,149
ton of emails incoming emails every

447
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:18,149
single day and then knowing that the

448
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:20,310
individual here is so security conscious

449
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:22,380
as to not click on the phishing email

450
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:24,000
allows me to sleep so much better at

451
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,640
night and it's not just for this person

452
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,610
again but for the others as well who are

453
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,280
hyper aware and if they do have

454
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:34,620
questions they're willing and not afraid

455
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:40,860
to reach out to me to get a second

456
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:42,719
opinion and this is also one of my

457
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,620
favorite examples one of my favorite

458
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:51,450
engineers I get a chance to work with so

459
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:56,399
this engineer here pinged me in the

460
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:58,260
morning at 9:24 a.m. two reports had to

461
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:03,090
come in from hacker one from our bug

462
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:07,950
bounty with two things that weren't

463
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:12,270
great and the point here is that the

464
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:16,440
engineer proactively already checked

465
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:19,139
their email looked through it triage it

466
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,890
and even had pull requests ready to go

467
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:24,960
in about an hour after this message so

468
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:29,970
just think about how cool that actually

469
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:32,700
is that I don't have to go and bug the

470
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:36,120
different teams hey can you go fix this

471
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,610
this is an issue so to have people who

472
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,449
are willing to be on your team and on

473
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,330
your side

474
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:44,940
that's so so powerful and it makes my

475
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:49,320
job honestly that much easier so I can

476
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:52,110
focus on things that are not that may be

477
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,210
more relevant at a time with a bigger

478
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:56,699
risk but some of these low-hanging fruit

479
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:01,650
I already can trust the rest of the

480
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:06,960
company to take care of so we've gone

481
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:08,760
over a ton of things and now you've seen

482
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,890
a ton of different strategies from a

483
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,460
technical perspective from a cultural

484
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:16,500
perspective

485
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:18,620
and yeah nothing live you it's not easy

486
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,930
there's a lot of stuff going on

487
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:27,239
so to summarize from a technical

488
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:29,010
perspective ABC always be coding so my

489
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,460
favorite emoji I was shocked to find

490
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:35,040
that ABC worked out really well

491
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:38,480
static code analysis vulnerable

492
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:41,220
dependency management pen testing and

493
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,910
using a bug Pony program so the top

494
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,250
three are development and shifting left

495
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:51,030
or pushing left and then the bottom two

496
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:54,630
are post the deploy so by being able to

497
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:57,780
have a combination of pre and post that

498
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:59,580
is a minimal amount of time required for

499
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,330
each of these different things with a

500
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:07,290
huge output that allowed me to scale on

501
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:10,320
the technical side and from the cultural

502
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:12,960
side I can't stress enough how important

503
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,320
is to build relationships to be

504
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,860
authentic to be accessible and to

505
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,290
provide the security education again the

506
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:25,800
technical ones were fun as attend the

507
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:28,320
whole person but by being able to use

508
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:32,940
these cultural strategies I've been able

509
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:37,200
to inculcate a culture of security at

510
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:40,320
Gaston so now this brings back to one of

511
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,200
my first slides despite being

512
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,389
outnumbered

513
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,990
despite averaging in priorities and

514
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:52,740
despite being just an Icee without a

515
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:55,320
director or a CSO title I was able to be

516
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,600
incredibly powerful by being able to

517
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:01,710
empower others to deeply care about

518
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:04,889
security now for those of you who may be

519
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:07,020
also a one-person security team or maybe

520
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:09,900
you're thinking about moving to a new

521
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,790
job where you'd be the first in the

522
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,620
whole eye view it's not easy and it's

523
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:17,159
going to be a lot of work but by being

524
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:19,679
able to see the fruits of the efforts

525
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,900
that you put in you are able to build a

526
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:25,790
security culture from the ground up and

527
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,790
that's been incredibly rewarding for me

528
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:31,690
now if there's one thing you take away

529
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:35,440
from this whole presentation is that

530
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:39,130
solely relying on a director or CSO

531
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:45,790
title to influence is a problem that

532
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:53,920
positional power will not solve to have

533
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:58,480
true power you need to have a desire to

534
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:02,920
solve and to understand and to solve

535
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:07,330
challenges with software and with

536
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:10,420
relationships so thank you so much for

537
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:14,620
listening and that's my presentation so

538
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:17,970
here's some contact info for myself so

539
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,570
would love to chat some more about this

540
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:24,160
anything else

541
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:26,590
I'm open to just time with different

542
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,860
strategies and I think one last thing I

543
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:33,209
want to thank Ricky and flea Augusto

544
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:37,439
so they were instrumental in helping me

545
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:41,800
create presentation to edit it and then

546
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,170
for those of you who also I think you're

547
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,629
all in Europe but anyone's in the u.s.

548
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:49,380
we're hiring so to be able to work with

549
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:52,150
a world-class security team I'm gonna

550
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:56,520
throw Gus tell or hiring so if

551
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:56,520
interested let's chat thank you

552
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:09,290
question thank you

553
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,340
does this work yet so is actually the

554
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,350
first time I've spoke with someone from

555
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,760
hacker one today his first time I heard

556
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,040
of the company I was just asking your

557
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,379
opinion of the value of doing that

558
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,300
versus like is it should it sit on top

559
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,720
of penetration tests or should you do

560
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,800
like this instead of absolutely that's a

561
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,360
fantastic question

562
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,750
yep so one thing that's worked really

563
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,330
well for Gus though is to run both pen

564
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:39,270
tests and a bug bite program so for the

565
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,830
pen test that happens once a year maybe

566
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,230
twice a year depending on how often you

567
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:46,889
want to run it but that in itself is an

568
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:48,900
in-depth four-week deep dive where they

569
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:51,600
have source code a full access to go

570
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,670
through your systems and that in itself

571
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,219
is invaluable you get a report at the

572
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:58,650
end of the engagement but the thing is

573
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:02,130
for a brownie to combine it where it's

574
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:03,780
an ongoing program where you have people

575
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,780
looking at it through the entire year

576
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:10,260
not for just this for months these are

577
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:13,290
similar but analogous but tangential

578
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:15,360
into having both a pen tests and a bug

579
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,250
report or bug program it's actually make

580
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:26,909
sense on why it makes sense to have both

581
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:29,790
not just one thank you for interesting

582
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:32,310
talk it seems like you are positioning

583
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:34,020
your role as very supportive trying to

584
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:37,409
work with the developers and try not to

585
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:40,950
be the bad guy but I think about

586
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:43,050
sometimes you as a security person are

587
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:45,000
like the paranoid person yes and

588
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:48,960
sometimes I think oh here she comes

589
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,920
again with yeah she's watching too much

590
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,250
too many 80s movies about Russian evil

591
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,410
people

592
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,480
absolutely so how do you deal with these

593
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:59,460
kind of potential conflicts or

594
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,800
differences in viewpoints about what is

595
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:07,410
a risk and what is not absolutely that's

596
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:09,300
a great question so I think there it is

597
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:12,390
a tricky situation because so there have

598
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:14,760
been times where I have needed to like

599
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,270
lay down my foot and say no this has to

600
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,310
be fit

601
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:20,520
so we have two priors this prioritize

602
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:22,230
this as a p0 over different things but

603
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,120
the key thing here is that you've built

604
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:27,210
up this much goodwill to what I

605
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:30,389
initially referred to earlier so they

606
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:33,120
inherently trust you when you say that

607
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:35,820
this actually is an issue they'll

608
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,399
believe you it is an issue and then you

609
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:40,860
aren't pulling the fire alarm for every

610
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,350
single thing used to balance risk among

611
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:46,169
the different issues some things may

612
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:48,300
have to slide you might not have tender

613
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:50,970
upon it right now but if it's a loan of

614
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:53,399
issue you can let that go and really

615
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:55,590
focus on the important and the big wins

616
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,090
again once you're ready to pull a fire

617
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,040
alarm they're going to be at your side

618
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:02,879
ready to assist you because you don't

619
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:05,820
trust with them that make sense so it's

620
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,620
a bit of 2-0 petals yes yes so and then

621
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,800
that's working probably well again I

622
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:13,199
would love to fix I have a whole battle

623
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,300
of issues things I've seen augusto that

624
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,030
I would love to fix buggin for the

625
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:23,190
biggest things for risk for us I've been

626
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:26,370
able to effectively mitigate those by

627
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:31,520
using my resources and choosing the

628
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:31,520
battles appropriately thank you Thanks

629
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,970
should I repeat sure yeah sorry my

630
00:33:55,290 --> 00:34:00,270
question is if you are working on

631
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:03,690
premise or in the cloud because you have

632
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:05,520
one part is the infrastructure and I

633
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:08,460
realize and my company is that we have a

634
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:12,600
huge problem but in SDLC and cloud

635
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:16,949
security yes and one person it's really

636
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:21,179
less yes yes so yes we are in the cloud

637
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:24,750
solely on AWS one thing as we're saying

638
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:28,610
is that I don't have a time to go

639
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:31,699
through every a.m. I'd go through every

640
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:35,060
- instance go through every alb to audit

641
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:38,960
these different things so this comes

642
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:42,739
down to me trusting the infrastructure

643
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,980
team to appropriately handle it

644
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:47,810
that is a bit terrifying to give trust

645
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:51,530
over someone else and then occasionally

646
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:54,529
I'll poke in on it around but if we set

647
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:57,980
the proper defaults and by having

648
00:34:54,530 --> 00:35:01,460
occasional meetings with that infra team

649
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:05,150
then we get to have a sinks where I

650
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:07,220
don't do all the manual work but I can

651
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,230
keep up to date of what they're doing

652
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:11,000
yeah fully agree it's a super

653
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,250
challenging things I'm sure trying to

654
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:23,120
really figure out okay

655
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:25,040
Jacob thanks what sounds like you did a

656
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,990
great job especially interpersonally and

657
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,029
I know that's like a huge X that's a

658
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:33,319
huge struggle and really where a lot of

659
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:35,360
those winds are so one thing how would

660
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,370
you describe how you approach like the

661
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,590
kind of difficult players I notice in

662
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:42,350
your kind of get everyone on board and

663
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:45,980
you know come to those understandings

664
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:49,520
for instance you didn't have sea level

665
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:51,350
management or the board listed who are

666
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,670
often big people who could be out for

667
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:56,390
you against you so I'd be curious to

668
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:57,770
hear about them these are a certain

669
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,629
group you think you know like you're

670
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,610
saying people who are tough like for sea

671
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,750
levels or four different coworkers that

672
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:07,580
maybe bought into the idea of security

673
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:10,330
or just either either or yeah whatever

674
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:14,090
is more relevant for sure variance was

675
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:18,170
so I'll start with the sea level I was

676
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:20,480
really fortunate to partner with our CTO

677
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:23,600
he's one of the cofounders the company

678
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,450
so by me F XI reporting to him directly

679
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:30,020
I had I was in a great position actually

680
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,560
to influence and talk about different

681
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,980
things

682
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,110
push maybe an agenda that I had or

683
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:39,440
suggest maybe this tool or this pending

684
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:42,440
firm so I know that's kind of a unique

685
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,819
situation but by having a one of

686
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,710
even the co-founders botanist security

687
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:52,130
no one's going to argue against the CTO

688
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:55,000
co-founder and then for some of the eye

689
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:58,339
sees that actually is a great question

690
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,430
it just took time I know that some of

691
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:04,670
them were against me trying to maybe

692
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:08,868
restrict their access or to not allow

693
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:12,319
them to iterate as fast but once they

694
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:15,680
saw their other teammates not being

695
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:18,529
slowed down they slowly warmed up yeah

696
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,118
it's not an easy fight but was one that

697
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,700
I was willing to have to get these

698
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:26,420
different co-workers and maybe tough I

699
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:28,399
see individuals on board nice so it's

700
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:36,740
like inherent peer pressure but from

701
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:38,270
their teammates I guess rice will be the

702
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:46,149
last one we have hundred you don't

703
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:50,359
understand do you have any tips about

704
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:54,230
choosing or managing priorities what's

705
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:56,480
more important when you have this little

706
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,490
time that's a great question

707
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,940
yep so when it comes down to managing

708
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:04,220
cardis it all comes down to me at least

709
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:07,039
is what is the biggest risk to the

710
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:09,799
company and that is a question that's

711
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,180
quite broad reaching and which is why it

712
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:13,009
was so important for me to build with

713
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,500
chips with the different individuals on

714
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:17,119
different teams so people on legal think

715
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,880
that maybe this one thing is a priority

716
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,010
but this other person on the compliance

717
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,099
team thinks it's that so about being

718
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,880
able to correlate and get all this

719
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:29,150
information

720
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,490
I'm able to digest it and also send it

721
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,770
back out and ask for different pieces of

722
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:37,759
feedback and then by being able to have

723
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:40,430
a risk ranking of the different team

724
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,289
just requires going on I'm able to put

725
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:48,368
my time maybe towards the top three for

726
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:50,299
example and let go of the four and downs

727
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:53,079
super difficult but I think that's where

728
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:53,079
it's really evolved for me

729
00:38:56,799 --> 00:39:00,620
sorry but that was the time for

730
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:03,889
questions

731
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,888
