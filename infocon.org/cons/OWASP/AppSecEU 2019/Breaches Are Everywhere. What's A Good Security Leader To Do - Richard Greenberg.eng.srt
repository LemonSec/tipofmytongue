1
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:07,790
welcome and thanks for coming

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,540
who else is wearing their special

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:15,230
colorful vendor socks anyone else I wear

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:18,560
I'm at every talk I can you know be a

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,670
little flamboyant but I'm only a pawn

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,909
call anyway

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:27,260
I'm Richard Greenberg and I am a former

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:31,820
CEO of 15 years and we have these

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:33,320
problems where I work - I am a global

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,179
awasa board member but that had nothing

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,800
to do with my talk being selected it's a

12
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:39,620
blind process I just want to clear the

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,379
air on that I was rejected in DC there's

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,870
proof and so here I am hopefully I can

15
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:47,449
shed some light on with the life of a

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,419
CISOs like and what people at that level

17
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:53,510
are doing right to address what's going

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,010
on in the environment today hopefully

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,678
there'll be some takeaways for everyone

20
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,260
regardless of the level of your work and

21
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,780
where you work clearly most people here

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,500
are hands-on and in development and

23
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,420
security of code that I'll be talking

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,890
about some of that thankfully I don't

25
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,930
have to explain the difference between

26
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,790
static and dynamic scanning not to this

27
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,450
group which is what I'd normally have to

28
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:19,490
do but there'll be other things if you

29
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,670
have a question please raise your hand I

30
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,860
don't mind in the middle discussion is

31
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,990
always welcome and let's get going

32
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:30,799
I'll see what we come up with yes it's

33
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:33,469
working excellent so the good news is

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,170
that in boardrooms finally at the

35
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:39,048
c-suite Security is now being discussed

36
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,969
right for the wrong reasons but we'll

37
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:43,640
take it just because there's tons of

38
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:46,759
breaches now it's so you know on the

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,299
cover of magazines and newspapers I'm

40
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:52,420
not sure how your experience is but mine

41
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:54,590
certainly the last four or five years

42
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,810
friends and relatives are now saying to

43
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,280
me hey what's going on with security you

44
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,520
know now they're concerned we're in the

45
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,570
past they had no clue nor did they care

46
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,640
you still have people like that of

47
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:07,460
course but you know that's the good news

48
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,780
in again I'm based in America I'll be

49
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,970
saying a few things if it's not

50
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,480
applicable here I'd be curious to know

51
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,310
that so just you know yell out if you

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,159
see something and you want to educate me

53
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:23,239
right because I'm so learning about EU

54
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:25,190
and other areas but in America they're

55
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,080
trying to legislate security a little

56
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,879
bit but every time they try to legislate

57
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,470
security it's a miserable failure

58
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,018
because they're legislating on things

59
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,780
that for two years ago so they're always

60
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:38,239
behind however the good news about

61
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,510
legislation in the States we can use

62
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,670
that for budgetary purposes right

63
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,500
compliance compliance is not security we

64
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:49,040
all know that but from the perspective

65
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,989
of getting budget it's wonderful I was

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,328
working in the health department in LA

67
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:57,290
County la is a little town on the west

68
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:59,810
coast of the States and once hit became

69
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,548
my peers were all freaking out oh my god

70
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,470
and I said are you kidding it's the best

71
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:06,470
thing that's ever happened to us and all

72
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:10,430
of a sudden we got funding so good news

73
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,989
so here's the deal our data is leaking

74
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,150
we all know that right it's it's a

75
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:17,299
terrible situation now breaches are

76
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:20,540
increasing in all or ways every

77
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:22,220
application that we're writing phishing

78
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,709
attacks or getting people left and right

79
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,989
we can try to educate our users as much

80
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:30,859
as possible but ultimately we're not

81
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:33,169
going to stop at all right and the and

82
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:34,940
the sad fact is that breaches are

83
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:36,889
happening and people aren't even knowing

84
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,840
about it the perpetrators are in our

85
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:42,139
systems for a good six to nine months

86
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,180
before they're even discovered and too

87
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,220
often they're discovered and we are

88
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,130
notified but an external agency like the

89
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:53,060
FBI so the monitoring the detection is

90
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:55,069
failing and of course we know now the

91
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,040
attackers no more script kitties the no

92
00:03:55,069 --> 00:04:01,010
more people who want notoriety it's all

93
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,650
about financial resources and those

94
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,200
resources are your data regardless of

95
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,790
what kind of system you have and you

96
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,780
don't have to be a financial institution

97
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:14,780
any longer

98
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:17,209
everything is monetized and you know we

99
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,738
have IOT which isn't helping basically

100
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,260
it's turned back the clock about ten

101
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:23,030
years you remember when Microsoft first

102
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,340
came out with their servers and their

103
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,690
tools everything failed open everything

104
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,200
came out of the box open and you had to

105
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,150
put security in

106
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,770
finally got through all that now things

107
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,440
come secure and you got to open up

108
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,080
things but guess what IOT he's turned

109
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,550
back the clock so it's a total mess and

110
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,590
it's getting worse because now it's

111
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,780
consumer based we're in the past it was

112
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,909
the IT experts who kind of knew that and

113
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,599
we're working with that and he gave a

114
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:51,510
good talk about this earlier so you have

115
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,950
to have an IOT strategy because it's on

116
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,270
your network whether you think it is or

117
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,180
not there are companies now that are

118
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,640
selling tools to identify things on your

119
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,780
network that you don't know are there

120
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,539
and this doesn't even address the

121
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,619
situations at home so watch out for the

122
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,780
killer toaster that's coming our way

123
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:13,860
we all know the sad fact of the second

124
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,419
bullet for example sequel 12 years the

125
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,150
fix has been out and everyone knows

126
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,800
about it it's still showing up in the OS

127
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,590
top 10 is still showing up regularly

128
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,260
there's a failure in process there's a

129
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,229
failure in understanding at the top in

130
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,310
the security chain or in the C suite

131
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:32,580
money's still not being allocated

132
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:36,180
properly patching as usual I'll talk

133
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:39,240
more about patching in my opinion if I

134
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,630
had to spend money on one thing and one

135
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,010
thing only it would be patching right we

136
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,010
all want secure code we want a lot of

137
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,510
things but the reality is you get this

138
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,520
triangle and up at the top there's just

139
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,140
a little bit of money for security but

140
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,940
patching would have the most impact but

141
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,200
I'll talk about that we need to have

142
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,540
change management and configuration

143
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,219
management printers and copiers are

144
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,050
plugged into networks and aren't secured

145
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,780
so we got backdoors with those all over

146
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,540
the place and any kind of

147
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,549
mission-critical data must be encrypted

148
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,590
there can be no discussion about that

149
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,210
and that's still not happening and some

150
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:16,049
companies are wondering why why are we

151
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:21,359
losing data phishing as I mentioned is a

152
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:23,460
problem our users are engaged with their

153
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,980
with their email it's a personal thing

154
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,359
they get friends family and and cohorts

155
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,550
who send them something and they you

156
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,440
know we're human beings right if you get

157
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,870
something that says hey this is a

158
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,550
wonderful wonderful joke you got to

159
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,320
click there and you're working your ass

160
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,320
off during the day so there's a

161
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,248
temptation to click on that I'd be a

162
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,839
high percentage of folks here

163
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:46,689
this room probably haven't done that I

164
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:50,139
won't ask you to raise your hand I won't

165
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:51,939
raise mine either so we know about some

166
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,069
of the insanity going on I'm just

167
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:55,689
exciting a few examples this could go on

168
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:57,879
for the whole talk I don't want to

169
00:06:55,689 --> 00:07:00,219
burden you with that but you know the

170
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:03,039
number of Records a hundred million you

171
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:05,229
know records for Capital One you know a

172
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,748
friends at Facebook who are so enamored

173
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:11,019
with privacy right other than ours six

174
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:12,909
hundred million users the collection you

175
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:15,909
know the the passwords that would dumped

176
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:18,489
I mean look at these numbers right huge

177
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:20,259
and even more and these are I'm just

178
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:22,328
citing some of the larger ones that we

179
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:25,349
were aware of recently but as I said

180
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:28,169
this list can just keep on going but

181
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:30,669
these are large multibillion-dollar

182
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:33,039
corporations in the states and then too

183
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:35,829
many of them worldwide and they're

184
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,989
getting hacked right so the question I'm

185
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:39,639
asked quite a bit when I talk to small

186
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:42,149
and medium businesses in the states is

187
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,289
what chance do we have if these guys are

188
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:46,110
not doing it they're supposed to have

189
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:50,259
time effort budget and security teams

190
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:52,809
but there are things that we can do how

191
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,579
about the costs right if in these

192
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:57,099
discussions with the board room folks I

193
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:59,889
talk about you know what what happened

194
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:02,799
we IOT is actually adding cost now to

195
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,389
the costs of a breach and just for

196
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:07,179
reference again this is American

197
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:09,309
currency next talk I'll convert it but

198
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:11,198
you know you get the point so as an

199
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:13,719
example a million record breach which is

200
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,669
not uncommon any longer right that would

201
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:18,099
cost forty million dollars and that does

202
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:20,198
not include reputational costs or

203
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:23,498
retention of customer cost this is just

204
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,119
pure dollars to fix the problem make a

205
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:27,189
breach of 50 million and those are

206
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:28,829
becoming more common if you who remember

207
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:32,558
some of their a couple of slides ago

208
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:36,250
those are almost all those qualify

209
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:38,698
that's a $350 tab 103 and fifty million

210
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,049
dollar tab so there's definitely

211
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:43,088
justification to finally get the

212
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,929
attention of the decision makers at the

213
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,540
top of the chain

214
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:47,109
one of the problems I'm not sure how it

215
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,610
is here

216
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:54,100
but throughout the states the CSO is not

217
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,610
functioning as a quote C so cuz what's

218
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,350
that first letter chief

219
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,440
supposed to be up there with the c-suite

220
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,950
see but they're usually report to a CIO

221
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,930
or a CTO or or somewhere down the chain

222
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,300
and they don't get the audience with the

223
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,739
decision-makers enough and now I'll talk

224
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,719
a little bit about that too but that's a

225
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,850
major problem all right if you're not at

226
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,779
the table then how you gonna get the

227
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,209
audience how you gonna get the

228
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:21,050
credibility because if you're assessing

229
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:22,910
the CIO and his work do you think that

230
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,770
the CIO is going to send everything up

231
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,959
to the top or you think they might

232
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:29,300
filter it you might have a wonderful

233
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,640
relationship and have a great CIO but

234
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,859
from a strategic hierarchical structure

235
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,830
it's a recipe for failure and it is

236
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,270
failing oh by the way what's the average

237
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:41,810
cost for a breach three point eight six

238
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:45,670
million dollars so those small medium

239
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:48,589
businesses are in definitely trouble so

240
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,390
how about what's what's the feeling

241
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,399
about security among security

242
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,040
professionals the leaders so these

243
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,350
studies were done and seventy percent of

244
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,610
organizations say that their senior

245
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,279
leadership has a comprehensive

246
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:04,399
understanding of cybersecurity or a

247
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,079
stake are taking positive steps might

248
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,930
sound good but turn it around that means

249
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,310
thirty percent aren't thirty percent

250
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,529
that's huge

251
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,510
we has a problem here seventy percent

252
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,070
seventy seven percent of organizations

253
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,649
are still operating with only limited

254
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,730
cyber security and resilience what

255
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:21,440
chance do we have

256
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,600
we're all connected now to all our

257
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,570
business partners so we can't look in

258
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,220
isolation right if we have one company

259
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:31,760
here you can't just go well that's their

260
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,160
problem it's our problem okay eight was

261
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,329
eighty-seven percent of organizations

262
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,730
warned they don't have sufficient budget

263
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:39,380
to provide well yes of course I have

264
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,700
never spoken to a CEO who's gotten all

265
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,970
the budget that they felt they needed

266
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,730
not wanted needed and this is a UI

267
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,649
global information survey so these are

268
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,260
not my numbers so the breaches are

269
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:54,380
increasing the fist sophistication is

270
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,930
finally starting to increase let me make

271
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,070
a note about this all the big breaches

272
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,149
that we've heard about over the last

273
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,550
five years

274
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:04,640
what's the PR spin coming from their

275
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:06,800
communications head this sophisticated

276
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,740
attack got us

277
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,069
sophisticated is used so much none of

278
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:15,290
the breaches that have been happening up

279
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:18,410
until recently have been sophisticated

280
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:19,939
if you get a targeted attack that's from

281
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,310
a nation-state that's a different story

282
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,230
right but all these attacks that have

283
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:27,529
been going on they're not sophisticated

284
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:30,410
this is just spin right but if things

285
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:33,020
are getting more difficult for us well

286
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:38,000
so what can we do right and so here's

287
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:39,649
why you came in here I'm assuming some

288
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,839
of this is management level but this is

289
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,450
very important a lot of the skills for

290
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,330
security leader are soft skills right

291
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:49,700
then Armen technical right so let me go

292
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:52,610
through a bunch of these again interrupt

293
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:55,520
me if you have a question so what I

294
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,860
advocate is to make friends with and

295
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,459
build relations with all the business

296
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,350
units all the heads okay do security

297
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:03,859
training and don't do it like I'm doing

298
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,320
it

299
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:10,040
don't PowerPoint them to death be

300
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,899
creative right no you guys are we're all

301
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,819
in the field but for regular users this

302
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,230
won't work they'll come in they'll be

303
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,700
asleep they'll be on their phone and

304
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,200
they'll remember a damn thing you're

305
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,360
saying maybe four slides they'll

306
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,209
remember right don't do that be creative

307
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,180
think about for example game affine your

308
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:28,939
security awareness training pit division

309
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,010
against the vision okay whether we want

310
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,709
to admit it or not in our DNA as a

311
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,730
species we are competitive some people

312
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:37,069
are a little competitive

313
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,720
some people are usually competitive and

314
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,410
they'll run zoo run for office I guess I

315
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,720
don't know maybe they're

316
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,100
overcompensating but the point is we all

317
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,050
kind of like to compete with each other

318
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,360
how many gamers in this room probably

319
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,380
three-quarters when we all have one hand

320
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,720
raised that's interesting

321
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:54,020
okay so we're quietly competitive in

322
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,899
here so put people pit them against give

323
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,029
the winners of some kind of recognition

324
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:01,270
I worked in government so we could buy

325
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:05,329
them we can get a plaque and a thank-you

326
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,890
but corporations will buy gift cards to

327
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:10,640
different stores or Amazon or other

328
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:12,910
things a wonderful parking spot that's

329
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,500
rotated each month to the security star

330
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,689
you know we smile that this stuff but

331
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,310
guess what people want recognition how

332
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,360
many of you ever recognized for anything

333
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,040
other than hey

334
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,140
you didn't get this out in time we'd

335
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,910
like to be recognized it's human nature

336
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,760
right makes us feel good about ourselves

337
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,279
make people feel good about security and

338
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,420
list everyone as an army of security

339
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,860
folks know they're not gonna stop

340
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,899
everything but at least they'll be

341
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,240
thinking before they click that link

342
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:42,790
right again we're not gonna stop at all

343
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,790
but layered Security's is the way we win

344
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,599
let's see oh yes of course very

345
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,599
important many of you are probably

346
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,070
working for companies that do this

347
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,350
simulated phishing attacks where the

348
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,810
company itself fishes you and if you

349
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,029
click ok come get a little more training

350
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,040
right you have to understand what your

351
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:03,110
cooperation is is like what the

352
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,910
atmosphere is like right so does a

353
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,740
person open the email that's clearly a

354
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,810
phishing attack do they then click on

355
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,430
the link that's bad enough but then they

356
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,489
start entering credentials in the link

357
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:14,899
page I've seen that all too often and

358
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,970
you probably will see it where you work

359
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,430
as well but that you have to know this

360
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,140
right the lockdown things

361
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:23,800
ok patch management I mentioned it

362
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,810
earlier how important I believe it is

363
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,479
where I worked there's always always

364
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,849
this big push they want to exclude

365
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,829
certain systems because the their

366
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,390
third-party managed and they can't patch

367
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:37,069
it because they haven't certified it or

368
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,740
tested with a certain patch level and

369
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:42,440
you might break it well guess what I'd

370
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,680
rather break it than have someone who

371
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,560
wears a black hood breaking right so we

372
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,029
have to be able to patch our systems and

373
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,819
there are going to be some exceptions

374
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:55,220
for example met certain medical

375
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,870
equipment right those those are very

376
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,360
complex there are some of them are

377
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,699
life-threatening situations that could

378
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,420
occur so in those case you you do

379
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:09,170
control extra controls ok mitigating

380
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:11,420
controls you lock it on its own VLAN you

381
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,699
configure the firewall to only allow

382
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,310
access from the certain systems within

383
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:18,199
your network that need access lock down

384
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,750
all services I mean the same stuff you

385
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:24,760
would normally do but even more severe

386
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:27,410
because you can't lock down every

387
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,770
application access for every user it's

388
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,610
just too difficult yes

389
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:36,650
[Music]

390
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:40,970
do they get yes typically what happens

391
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:43,400
is with extreme pressure from security

392
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,320
folks and the business leader champion

393
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,079
it now you haven't need to get involved

394
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,910
with the business side they push the

395
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,400
vendor to Allah but they're behind

396
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:55,730
they're still behind ok

397
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,500
I mean they're probably still some XP

398
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:03,580
systems out there for this medical

399
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,580
equipment XP at least it's not 95 right

400
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,700
yeah just a little bit third party

401
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,170
patches are very crucial I've talked to

402
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,000
people who say well we've got our

403
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:16,010
Microsoft patching up and running I said

404
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,060
what about Adobe although you don't have

405
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,130
to worry too much about Adobe it's

406
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,709
really ever okay of course it's patched

407
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,870
all the time this it's a mess and so

408
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,730
this has to be done all third-party apps

409
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:30,500
need to be addressed to and this is

410
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:32,060
often you know forgiven but before you

411
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,710
roll out of patch you want to test it in

412
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,510
a test group which is representative of

413
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:37,730
all your major important applications

414
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:42,260
and who's that best use of the test

415
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:44,390
group our own people IT right and a few

416
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,950
business folks - Chris there's some

417
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,780
business systems that they use that we

418
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,920
don't so we want to make sure before we

419
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,449
throw it out there because we don't want

420
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,160
to do our own denial of service attack

421
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:59,900
do we a good strategy which I don't see

422
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,329
happening enough when you first start

423
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,369
and and they're in a role of senior

424
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,410
management security you want to make

425
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:08,719
friends with the decision makers it's

426
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:10,910
hard to figure out who they are because

427
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,370
as I mentioned earlier you're positioned

428
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,350
here and the decision makers are up here

429
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:20,479
and there's often someone blocking your

430
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:22,780
way you can go around right maybe the

431
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,920
culture in certain countries is

432
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,209
prohibitive about that you can't go

433
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,220
around you just have to go directly to

434
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:29,480
your supervisor but there's nothing

435
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,190
wrong with saying hey COO you want to

436
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,140
get lunch I'm new here in security you

437
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,330
know we could talk about my vision and

438
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,040
what's important to you you're a

439
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,210
stakeholder in the company you know what

440
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,909
do you want to see out of a good

441
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,010
security officer discussions it's

442
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,030
invaluable

443
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,870
another thing about human nature and

444
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,210
you'll see

445
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,800
disperse to what my talk is I'm an

446
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,690
amateur psychologist right so I'm a

447
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,409
little dangerous but a lot of it's just

448
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:56,450
based on my empirical experiences if you

449
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,620
buy someone lunch so I didn't mention

450
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,570
that if you've missed lunch would even

451
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,300
pick up the bill you can get a little

452
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:04,639
expensive but it's a down payment on

453
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,250
your future with the company people will

454
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,780
remember that so sell he bought me lunch

455
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,070
let me see what he has to say as opposed

456
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,470
I don't know the hell this guy is

457
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:16,939
security yeah you know their pain so

458
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,410
then just make sure you build relations

459
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,050
with the key players as I mentioned

460
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:23,690
before CTO application development right

461
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:26,300
we're all one big happy family ideally I

462
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:29,570
was able to do that after a lot of work

463
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:33,290
but it changed everything the last

464
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:35,870
bullet talk business ease it's not a

465
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:38,690
real word but the reality is you cannot

466
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,879
talk to upper management like we talked

467
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,140
to each other the glaze will glaze over

468
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,320
and they'll kick you out of the room I

469
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,850
don't care just talk about the things I

470
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,320
care about now I'll talk a little bit

471
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,490
more about that later

472
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,110
don't forget legal and risk compliance

473
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,210
my opinion is we should either be at the

474
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,219
C suite sitting at the table discussing

475
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,809
things with the CEO or we should be

476
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,540
reporting to risk compliance because

477
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:05,450
that's what head of security is it's all

478
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,070
risk right my job is not to get

479
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,670
technical I have operations folks that

480
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:13,870
do that I figured firewall long time ago

481
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:17,330
I really don't miss that all right

482
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:19,280
configuration management how many of you

483
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,080
have been in companies were your key

484
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,270
person this key system admin who builds

485
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,860
systems who was on vacation and the

486
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,170
backup was busy so you had someone else

487
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,629
build a server and ago did you put the

488
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:33,710
latest image on that we tested did you

489
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:35,990
patch it uh where is that process breaks

490
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,500
down and causes huge gaps in our

491
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:43,010
security company so this needs to be

492
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:46,940
regularly updated maintained okay and

493
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:48,500
deployed on every system including your

494
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,309
admins who like to feel that they're

495
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:54,470
exempt admins and and the top level you

496
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:56,090
know see poke people love to be exempt

497
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,750
from all kinds of rules and regulations

498
00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:00,389
but guess what they had

499
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,710
worst people to be exempt okay cuz

500
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,080
they're touching the most important

501
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,670
information admins touch all our

502
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,919
infrastructure stuff and can bring down

503
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,420
the entire network in the top level

504
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,640
folks touch our most valuable

505
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:14,820
information the gold that we try to

506
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,270
protect Harden every system shut off all

507
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:21,210
the system services that you don't need

508
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:24,690
right web service consistently have too

509
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,760
much things open make sure that you you

510
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,280
establish and test the change management

511
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:34,680
process don't make changes without

512
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:36,420
building a team of people who evaluate

513
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,610
what the effect of those changes will be

514
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:42,030
right and that all changes are equal

515
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,290
right empower the system admins to go

516
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,629
ahead with changes just with a

517
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,520
notification without approval if they're

518
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,470
minor changes but if it's going to

519
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,240
affect mission critical systems they

520
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,470
need the board approval because maybe

521
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,940
there's something else going on at the

522
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,250
same time that I know about so needs to

523
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,590
be coordination you must have a back out

524
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,840
plan if it doesn't work you got to

525
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,820
quickly be able to back up because you

526
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,500
can't bring down the you know a key

527
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,850
system that either makes the company

528
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,740
money or provides essential services

529
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:13,590
policies and procedures I'll just pass

530
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:16,650
along my pet peeve about this still

531
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:18,659
today I don't know why people are still

532
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:21,540
writing policies and putting procedures

533
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,360
in and there's 16 page policies the

534
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:26,820
point if a policy is you want people to

535
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,810
read it they're not going to read it if

536
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,629
they got to wade through all the

537
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:33,330
procedures but you also want to be aware

538
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,950
that the change of policy is a big pain

539
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,540
in the butt you got to get signatures

540
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,610
going all the way up to the top

541
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,710
administrator person in your company you

542
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,899
don't want to change your policy every

543
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,880
3-4 months when technology changes or

544
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,700
the way you do things change that's a

545
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,790
separate standing dynamic document your

546
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,620
procedures how you do it policy is what

547
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,260
you're going to do procedure is how

548
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,570
you're gonna do it keep them separate

549
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:59,190
otherwise you're asking for trouble you

550
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,919
know this the people at the top they

551
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,450
won't have minimum two things minimal

552
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,430
time to spend with you you know sign

553
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,510
this okay I did that two years ago right

554
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,520
okay that's fine

555
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:10,140
but your procedure should be constantly

556
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,040
kept up to date and you need to review

557
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,350
them on a regular

558
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,200
if you make a significant infrastructure

559
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:17,969
change or something important about your

560
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,640
whole organization and review your

561
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,610
policies because there could be changes

562
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,120
that you need to make on those as well

563
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:30,810
please engage HR policies should be part

564
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,820
of hrs oversight as well they get the

565
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:35,639
employees to read and sign your

566
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,929
acceptable use policy write legal wants

567
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,790
to make sure that they all have seen it

568
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,880
and sign it so if they do something

569
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,110
that's terribly stupid and wrong they

570
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,670
can't turn around and say well you

571
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,610
didn't let me know that this was wrong

572
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:49,260
um and there have been well Merck is

573
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,899
terrible with legal system everyone's

574
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,430
suing everybody for everything it's

575
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,530
better here for sure that much I know

576
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,930
but there still will be people will say

577
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:01,470
well you know you didn't inform me right

578
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:04,560
so that's important portable devices

579
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:06,900
BYOD by now you would think that there

580
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,970
are plans and ways to address it but

581
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,670
it's still problematic you're gonna have

582
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,590
a lot of people who only want one phone

583
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:15,750
which means that their phone now has to

584
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,949
have access to the critical data in your

585
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,690
systems you have to figure out a way you

586
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,550
want to do that with you sandbox it and

587
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,800
have us a special compartment on their

588
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,889
phone whether you manage their phone

589
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,419
with your mobile device management tool

590
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:30,750
the users need to understand the impact

591
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:32,340
that will have on them and in the States

592
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,960
there's something called the discovery

593
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,290
you haven't said anything like that here

594
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:40,650
- okay so what happens in America if

595
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:43,470
there's there's an investigation or a

596
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:46,770
legal action and someone has used their

597
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:49,680
phone for business purposes that phone

598
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,660
can now be brought in as evidence and

599
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,690
examine to look for emails or

600
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,310
information regarding the case so a user

601
00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:00,360
needs to be aware of this stuff so I

602
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:02,850
won't talk any more about that here this

603
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,100
is of interest to everyone here but

604
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,330
you're very familiar with this but it's

605
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,949
still a problem in the States it's

606
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:11,340
probably a problem here not enough

607
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:15,450
security is getting baked in early on

608
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:17,970
from the very beginning okay key

609
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,410
relationships see so ahead of

610
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,350
application development they've got to

611
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:24,529
be friends they got to work together we

612
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,959
need somehow to

613
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:29,879
good application developers to want to

614
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,710
be security champions to want to work

615
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:34,049
with security and the other way around

616
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,869
I've seen situations where you have

617
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:39,389
really intelligent security folks that

618
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:41,009
don't code they just because that's the

619
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:43,049
makeup of the workforce in that

620
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:45,509
particular company and yet these coders

621
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:47,129
that would like to do security but they

622
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:48,719
never received the training in school

623
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:50,968
because they learned in universities

624
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:52,739
where security wasn't built in they just

625
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:54,359
learned how to efficiently code and get

626
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:56,129
the stuff done and get it out and they

627
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,349
feel proud when they get creative

628
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:59,998
sometimes but they're still using tons

629
00:24:58,349 --> 00:25:01,710
of third-party libraries without even

630
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,690
thinking about whether they're secure or

631
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:07,139
different ways to do it are they grammar

632
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:09,239
tizen so there needs to be a bridge in a

633
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:11,399
lot of companies right so you need to

634
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:13,619
get an application developer who wants

635
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:15,748
to be into security get him trained get

636
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:18,089
him working with security team you don't

637
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:20,279
want the security team to hand off to

638
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:21,989
the application developers here's this

639
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:25,200
hundred page report we got out of our

640
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:26,849
dynamic scanner go fix that'll just blow

641
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,529
the whole relationship so the security

642
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:30,839
team needs to be able to sort through

643
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:32,820
all the false positives and sort through

644
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:34,499
and say hey we this isn't applicable

645
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,479
where we are because we have other

646
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:38,399
controls in place right because every

647
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:40,919
company's different so there needs to be

648
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:44,399
a joint effort in going forth and

649
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,710
exploring all this stuff I'm preaching

650
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:49,589
to the choir here but when I talk to see

651
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,119
cells of CIOs I have to explain the

652
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:53,099
difference between pregnant penetration

653
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:56,158
tests and vulnerability scanning you

654
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:58,109
guys get it you have to do both in any

655
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,489
application because if you just do the

656
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:00,899
automated stuff you're not gonna catch

657
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:03,599
anywhere need you need manual code

658
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:05,549
reviews pen testing these all have to be

659
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:10,379
built into the whole processes at your

660
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:14,940
companies on the project side there are

661
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:17,309
lots of good intentioned new

662
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,469
applications that somebody spoke to

663
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:21,928
appear in another company and they bring

664
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:24,179
in and we're gonna do this at the very

665
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:26,159
moment they bring that into the company

666
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:28,529
it's got to be logged with your project

667
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,899
management team and security needs to be

668
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:34,200
notified what we did is we came up with

669
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:36,299
a whole qualification checklist tell us

670
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,080
whatever you know about this app so far

671
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,490
because

672
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,500
haven't even built the platform yet

673
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,290
right but it's an intention a proposed

674
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,180
project and I had built-in security

675
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,310
questions at the very beginning this

676
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,980
would be addressed by the access from

677
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:51,810
the Internet is it just our company's

678
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,090
employees as are the business partners

679
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,460
is it the public each one of these comes

680
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,780
with a different risk level and you need

681
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,610
to know that and based on their

682
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,040
responses that's how you would propose

683
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:05,010
building and security controls so that

684
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,740
has to be reviewed if you have a PMO

685
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:09,360
project management office or some air

686
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,880
whatever you call it

687
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,409
Security's got to be speaking with them

688
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,220
and building something like this in

689
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:18,990
place I think that just about every one

690
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,870
of my peers I've ever spoken to at some

691
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,800
point it might be back five years ago

692
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,300
someone comes to them and said here this

693
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,909
systems going live Monday and it's

694
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,419
Thursday afternoon like what are you

695
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,550
serious

696
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,580
I'm not letting anything go alive unless

697
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:34,409
I learn about it and you know hopefully

698
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,360
those days are gone but yeah I'm sure

699
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,040
that in companies that you still see in

700
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,679
these problems don't forget physical

701
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,420
security in the States there's something

702
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,120
called the CSO a chief security officer

703
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,780
and typically physical security is under

704
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,209
them as well

705
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,879
surveillance cameras access cards to get

706
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,920
into the buildings but typically its si

707
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,020
ISO and then head of security or

708
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,110
physical security or fit head of

709
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:01,020
facilities and the problem the head of

710
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:03,330
physical security is normally not

711
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,330
trained in anything related to

712
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:09,060
information security so for decades the

713
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:11,639
access cards could be easily skimmed if

714
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,560
he pulls at her card I can just walk by

715
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,020
are this close with a skimmer that's

716
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,480
easy to buy and now I've captured that

717
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,340
information I go back to my office we

718
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,030
went through and make my own card and

719
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:25,709
now I just walk right in I've seen it so

720
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:28,020
they need to be educated I did some

721
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,700
assessments where the security cameras

722
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,940
who are on the network but not secured

723
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,580
so I was able to download the images so

724
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,160
guess what another backdoor this fact

725
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,139
was everywhere but facilities people

726
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,990
never even thought about that so don't

727
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,370
forget that that's a big problem then do

728
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,080
you have processes in place you see

729
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:49,070
people walking out with servers I mean

730
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,070
it's happened

731
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,330
you have to monitor this one's really

732
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,449
important you've probably heard talks at

733
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,770
this conference and other conferences

734
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:59,570
you're not gonna stop someone who's

735
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,940
determined to get into your system you

736
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:04,970
will not stop them you can spend billion

737
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,950
dollars you will not but if you monitor

738
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,380
and detect them immediately you shut

739
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:12,860
them out block them right and so this is

740
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:17,270
key you also need to be able to react

741
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:19,129
quickly if they're in and architectural

742
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,930
II you want to segment your network to

743
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,060
as many different logical ways as

744
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,950
possible so they make you minimize the

745
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:29,360
loss if they happen to get through and

746
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:32,840
start exfiltrating data you want a

747
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,149
monitor the unusual behavior sally has

748
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,100
been a great worker but she works a

749
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,260
40-hour workweek and maybe once every

750
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,840
six months she'll work from home on a

751
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,370
Saturday four to three hours to download

752
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:47,209
you know thousand records to work on or

753
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:48,709
something but this one Saturday she's

754
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,740
downloading two hundred thousand records

755
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:54,200
and she's on line for five hours do your

756
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:57,020
systems detect this do you have anomaly

757
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,310
detection because this is what happens

758
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:02,720
because the inside of threat is very

759
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:04,429
real and then you look for patterns as

760
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,140
well are do you this your where your

761
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:09,470
helpdesk system which is not managed by

762
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:11,660
security but by here your admin team do

763
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,910
they just continually fix every ticket

764
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,440
blindly as quickly as possible or do

765
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,420
they stop and evaluate it at a higher

766
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,830
level and say wait a minute

767
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,440
did we have fifty people all have their

768
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,939
accounts locked at the same moment or

769
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,420
does the same person keep having this

770
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:29,420
thing over and over and over we had we

771
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:31,220
had one person who had kept continuously

772
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,170
having problems logging into the system

773
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,580
and so I said I gotta find out what's

774
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,560
going on so I went over to him and I

775
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,000
said so what story would you know we

776
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,610
keep having to research a password we

777
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,340
just reset it what was your old password

778
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:47,030
he said well it's Mickey Minnie Donald

779
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,439
Daffy Popeye Bluto Olive Amsterdam I

780
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,570
said excuse me

781
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,700
why do you have a pass with all exert

782
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:57,340
I'm following your policy and said what

783
00:30:52,700 --> 00:31:00,320
policy eight characters in a capital

784
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,360
okay it's a security field that's the

785
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,090
best way I can do have you Evan anyone

786
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,129
else do you know of us

787
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,629
security joke anyway that's the kind of

788
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,070
feel where it anyway I just felt we

789
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:11,780
needed that right we're getting close to

790
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,780
the end but give me a break

791
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:17,550
managed security services okay so we're

792
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:21,200
under a lot of pressure to find retain

793
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:23,790
and train people it's getting worse

794
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,560
right there's less and less available

795
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,260
people more and more need the

796
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,000
predictions for the future are a dire

797
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,770
okay and so a lot of companies are now

798
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,050
saying I'm just gonna pay a company in

799
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:36,810
the cloud to take care of a variety of

800
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:38,970
different aspects of my position they're

801
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:41,730
gonna do Incident Response who maybe

802
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,260
will back to back up to the cloud okay

803
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,750
but a word of caution

804
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:49,500
I've spoken to peers and some of them

805
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:51,990
say I find found out about this this

806
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,550
potential breach this intrusion into my

807
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,650
network before they did why am i paying

808
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:58,080
them six figures other people said they

809
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:00,330
saved my job they saved our company so

810
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,889
the best advice if you're thinking of

811
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,659
that because it's really a pain to

812
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:06,390
continuously train people and lose them

813
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:09,750
I would even find them if you're going

814
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:11,280
to explore that talk to your peers and

815
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,750
see what companies work for them because

816
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,500
they're really not all created equal

817
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:20,010
right it's really wide variety of

818
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,120
success stories and failures reporting

819
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,950
is really important

820
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,590
give you an example of something that we

821
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:28,050
did so we you run your vulnerability

822
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:29,939
scans on your network and identifies

823
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:34,169
anything that's plugged in then you

824
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:36,900
compare it to your dashboard for McAfee

825
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:39,180
Symantec Kaspersky whatever you have for

826
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,220
your endpoint and you compare that to

827
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:43,020
your patching system which will I should

828
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,960
identify every system on your network

829
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,160
and when you find systems in your

830
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,470
vulnerability scan that are not in these

831
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,750
others what does that mean the agents

832
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,830
were never properly installed that you

833
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,240
wouldn't know about it because it

834
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,939
doesn't show up in those dashboards so

835
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,040
you immediately open up helpdesk tickets

836
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,110
to get the agents deployed cuz you have

837
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,120
no endpoint protection on some systems

838
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:05,070
and guaranteed you will have these in

839
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,550
your system because you're massively

840
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:09,570
pushing out agents to thousands of

841
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,790
systems all at once

842
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:14,939
and you don't always get the reports

843
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:16,889
back of what a successfully patch so we

844
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,390
we find exceptions we found exception

845
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,280
just about every time we ran this report

846
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:24,870
opened up tickets and get those systems

847
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:26,970
updated that's very important when

848
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:29,159
you're doing your scanning you've open

849
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:31,320
up the tickets fix them get a good

850
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,480
relationship with your admin team but

851
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,770
then you got a scan again to see if

852
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,290
they've done their job because what will

853
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:41,220
they always say yeah we got it we got it

854
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:42,450
we're good do they always do it no so

855
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,010
you need a way unless you have an

856
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:47,780
automated system which will alert you

857
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:50,850
which there are some out there okay

858
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,980
access management there are a couple of

859
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:56,070
talks on at this conference about this

860
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,530
huge problem when people leave a company

861
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:02,070
this is the one that gets me a lot and I

862
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:04,680
still see it do you know every system

863
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:06,810
that they have access to you know we're

864
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:10,290
moving more and more towards a combined

865
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:11,820
single source of truth all right one

866
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,620
database that shows who has access to

867
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,540
everything that grants access if you

868
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,918
have a good full-blown iam system it's

869
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,159
expensive and takes a lot of work to

870
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:22,290
deploy but a lot of companies say well

871
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,970
I'm just integrated with AD but what

872
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:26,040
about the legacy systems oh yeah

873
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:28,830
that's true right so they have their own

874
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,509
database of user access somebody leaves

875
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:31,830
and they forget to turn that off they

876
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,929
could just log in from home to a lot of

877
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:36,889
these systems so there needs to be a

878
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:40,139
good process in place to be able to

879
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:42,418
certify that people still need access

880
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,069
and at the appropriate level we came up

881
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:45,600
with a manual system because I was

882
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,669
working in government and talking about

883
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:52,560
being behind the 8-ball always behind

884
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:57,960
and what we did was we issued we printed

885
00:34:52,560 --> 00:35:01,200
out the Access database for each system

886
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,240
a lot of systems I know and they we

887
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,950
indicated the level of access and

888
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,240
whether their admin or just user or

889
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,980
workgroup leader whatever you want to

890
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,890
call it and then we sent it to the

891
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,840
business owner or the the system owner

892
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:15,359
and they had to go through the list and

893
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,070
certify and sign at the bottom that all

894
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,380
these people's need to access if they

895
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:22,410
came across people that had left that we

896
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,080
didn't know about which happens believe

897
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:27,240
it or not they had to open up a ticket

898
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,920
send it to the admin team they removed

899
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,269
the user or change the access

900
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,980
and of course this was not real time

901
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:36,779
right it was I can audit but if we were

902
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,119
hitting all the systems and so that's an

903
00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:41,250
example of ways that you can compensate

904
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,779
for not having the budget things you

905
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:46,369
need to do is you got to get creative

906
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:48,660
this was a hard project I needed to send

907
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:51,650
countless emails to get people to

908
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:55,890
complete the forms phone calls visits

909
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:58,740
but it was important I felt now that I

910
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:01,980
mentioned patch yes I did so just to

911
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,500
level set you guys were all too familiar

912
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:07,319
painfully familiar I'm sure with wanna

913
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,730
cry right it's and that never would have

914
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:10,950
happened if they had just patch with the

915
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,339
patch that was already out for many many

916
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:14,549
months

917
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:16,319
never would happened many of the

918
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:18,420
breaches would not have happened that

919
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:19,650
people had just patched so that's why I

920
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,109
say this is crucial

921
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:24,720
a lot of the ransomware would not be

922
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:26,640
happening it's not always easy to patch

923
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,879
might some people have said to me that

924
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,650
work for huge companies fortune 500

925
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,019
there's no way we get everything we just

926
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:37,019
have too many servers well that's your

927
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:38,490
choice this no it really is you decide

928
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:41,430
if you want to accept a certain risk

929
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:44,038
level then you can but at least you need

930
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:47,519
to understand the ramifications of your

931
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:49,890
actions Incident Response I talked a

932
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,779
little bit about it earlier as far as

933
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:54,808
the monitoring but you've got to have a

934
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:57,900
team that understands what the issue is

935
00:36:54,809 --> 00:37:01,160
the the biggest takeaway from this slide

936
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:04,319
is please test your Incident Response

937
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,879
system come up with a scenario actually

938
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:08,400
run through it tell everyone okay we're

939
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,029
doing the test go everyone needs to be

940
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,460
notified everyone right hold on a minute

941
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:16,380
yeah oh we have that incident do you

942
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,650
need me you just run the plant good

943
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,880
that's what you want to do you don't

944
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,890
want to have to stress you wanted to

945
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,650
just go forward and everybody knows

946
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:27,660
their role you drilled it reversed it

947
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,490
just not as quite as as fear as a Navy

948
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,950
SEAL but you still gotta rehearse it

949
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,868
like it's a serious aspect because it

950
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,399
could bring down a company right make

951
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:37,200
sure you have the right people you still

952
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,109
want business leaders is not just system

953
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,390
admin guys and security sometimes as

954
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:44,549
application

955
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:45,900
legal finance right the people have to

956
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:50,310
understand let's say this is a breach

957
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:52,710
what would everybody do encrypt I'm sure

958
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:55,170
everyone is like going yeah yeah encrypt

959
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:57,600
everything stop with this trying to

960
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,700
figure out where the important stuff is

961
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,319
because what's important today tomorrow

962
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,509
if something else might be and somebody

963
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:07,770
might put something on the server that

964
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:09,869
is critical pH I and then that system is

965
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:12,930
not encrypted so everything needs to be

966
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:15,270
encrypted because this will prohibit a

967
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:18,270
lot of breaches you know people walk out

968
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:20,940
with pcs or laptops get stolen which we

969
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:23,250
know you know airports around the world

970
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,380
report thousands of laptops just left or

971
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,730
stolen on a regular basis you want yours

972
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:30,270
to be encrypted so you can just go well

973
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:31,980
we lost an asset we lost $800 we can

974
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:35,520
deal with that but you really don't want

975
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:37,680
to lose a hundred thousand records key

976
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,900
management can undermine all your best

977
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,629
efforts don't keep your keys on the same

978
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,000
server where your data is make sure you

979
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:47,270
have a good rotation plan for key

980
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,070
management that's it like a little

981
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:52,050
problem that we see that unfortunately

982
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:55,200
is still there you guys know about

983
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:57,660
telnet you still see it yes don't use

984
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,410
SSL anymore and we're up to TLS 21.2 I

985
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:06,540
think or is o33 the two is still good

986
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:08,640
right disaster recovery again test just

987
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,470
like I said with the incident response

988
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,339
must test your your disaster recovery

989
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,589
plan

990
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,000
because too many times I've heard of

991
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,859
stories or people say yeah we've been

992
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,119
backing up regularly ok can you restore

993
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,859
it

994
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:24,810
we're having trouble restoring we don't

995
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:27,150
know why did you test well know what so

996
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,619
please really very important again a lot

997
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:31,230
of the things I'm advocating take time

998
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:34,020
and takes collaboration and takes a lot

999
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:36,390
of units getting together but you know

1000
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,869
that's where the the role of a security

1001
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:42,390
officer as a sales person as a PR person

1002
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:45,300
comes in handy right you must do this

1003
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,890
though and the plan you've got to align

1004
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,920
with the business because it's not up to

1005
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:52,410
us as security professionals to make the

1006
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,590
decision of how long this is acceptable

1007
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:56,870
for a mission-critical app to be down

1008
00:39:54,590 --> 00:40:00,080
that's a business decision they need to

1009
00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:02,180
know okay we can get a hot hot site so

1010
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,920
we're up right away or we can get a hot

1011
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,660
warm hot coal we can be down for a

1012
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,990
certain amount of time that's not our

1013
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:10,490
decision we advise right so this needs

1014
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,959
to be discussed with business how long

1015
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,669
can you be down do you have manual

1016
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,860
systems for business continuity that you

1017
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,940
can continue to work with while we still

1018
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,410
work in the background to get the

1019
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,620
systems restored somewhere else

1020
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:22,970
all right so going back up to the cloud

1021
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,259
perhaps that's the next I mean that's

1022
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:26,209
happening more and more their companies

1023
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:30,650
are specialized in that takes that off

1024
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:33,080
of your hands but again money right so

1025
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:35,030
that you have to wait the fact that

1026
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,720
you're here shows you understand the

1027
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:39,980
value of networking and collaborating

1028
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,709
continue to come to attend events

1029
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,990
they're the best way for you prepare for

1030
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,820
your your career and to move on because

1031
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,740
you're gonna make friends with someone

1032
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,720
here who's gonna possibly help you

1033
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,919
dramatically in a situation that you

1034
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,069
have when you're not sure a way to get

1035
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,110
the answers I mean I'm sure there's been

1036
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:59,210
some conversations among you here today

1037
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:00,320
with someone who had a problem similar

1038
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:02,000
to what you're dealing with and maybe

1039
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,770
gave you some advice and there'll be

1040
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,730
more of that so these are really good

1041
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:09,740
for that I strongly advise you to do it

1042
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:12,740
I'm the biased because I'm on the global

1043
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,959
or wasps board so join us come to O wast

1048
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:25,220
experiences that are going to be related

1049
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:28,310
to what you're doing or what you will be

1050
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,720
doing exchange cards make sure you get a

1051
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:31,850
handful of cards before you leave the

1052
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,439
conference if you haven't looked next to

1053
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:35,779
you right now and ask somebody for a

1054
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:40,160
card trust me these two guys are gonna

1055
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:41,810
be good friends there is a lot of

1056
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,810
different groups too besides OWASP

1057
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:46,790
I'm also with Issa in the states that I

1058
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:48,650
know they have in Europe there's a lot

1059
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,759
of Issa so look into these things

1060
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,490
they're all not-for-profit or not

1061
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,140
selling you anything trying to help keep

1062
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,910
learning these things are probably

1063
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,879
essential right now in your arsenal of

1064
00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:00,819
how you do your work today right

1065
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,380
continue doing this continue learning

1066
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:05,540
right one of the things I loved about

1067
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,670
that old Star Trek series and the movies

1068
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,740
was as a future

1069
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:12,290
there's no money and you know one of the

1070
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:14,359
villains said wouldn't he know money

1071
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,790
then what do people live for I said to

1072
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,340
learn self-improvement that's us

1073
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:21,050
continue learning push yourself right

1074
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,760
push yourself past your comfort zone

1075
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,830
you'll never know what you're capable of

1076
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,660
right well my first time I spoke my

1077
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,040
nothing my knees were shaking I said I

1078
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,899
gotta learn to speak in front of people

1079
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:33,230
and I'm comfortable up here now

1080
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:35,240
hopefully it comes across that way

1081
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,730
I find LinkedIn and Twitter is really

1082
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,770
helpful to I get a lot of great links

1083
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:41,810
from people who who say this is a really

1084
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:44,630
good article or I just found out today

1085
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,040
that there's a draft for NIF's that's

1086
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:49,370
coming out with privacy that's they're

1087
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,230
gonna try to match it with the this the

1088
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:53,779
cybersecurity framework also there's a

1089

1092
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:07,129

1093
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,790
generation needs us all okay they need

1094

1095
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:14,779
help someone hire students I hired

1096
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:16,610
students they look it takes a little bit

1097
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,230
of time for me to train them but if I

1098
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:20,270
find someone really brilliant in the

1099
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:22,940
interview you can train them believe me

1100
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,860
and there's always stuff to give them to

1101
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:28,400
do all the stuff you don't want to do

1102
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,780
just they'll be happy because you got to

1103
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,930
start somewhere you got to learn right

1104
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:36,320
so please help this type of competitions

1105
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:38,899
ETF's help schools God's schools need

1106
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,640
our help so badly with curriculums right

1107
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,570
as I mentioned before application

1108
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,670
development they're not learned in

1109
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:46,040
security but anything related to our

1110
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:47,840
field help out go to your local school I

1111
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,029
know how many of you have kids but it'd

1112
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,800
be nice if they had a bright future to

1113
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:55,400
look forward to in this field was right

1114
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,660
look we all have job security right we

1115
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,160
got us the rest of our lives because

1116
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,279
unfortunately things are just gonna

1117
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,810
continue to you know be an arms race

1118
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,920
between you know blackhat hackers and us

1119
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:09,620
but we don't want the next generation

1120
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,420
have our opportunities but be better

1121
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,950
prepared than we were a lot of us came

1122
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,870
in had to learn on the fly I had to

1123
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,490
learn on the job I know I didn't really

1124
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,150
get good education and what I do i

1125
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,399
bounced around

1126
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:22,289
perhaps you want to teach you know just

1127
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,789
one class here or there or as a guest

1128
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:25,410
speaker if you know anyone was a

1129
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:29,190
professor say you know I can give a talk

1130
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:35,970
on apt ever deaths a cops or security

1131
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:38,249
consider that ok when when I've seen

1132
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:42,180
people give reports to the upper

1133
00:44:38,249 --> 00:44:45,689
management and they say we've had 15,000

1134
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,279
attempts to hack our system today do you

1135
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:50,309
think they care about that

1136
00:44:47,279 --> 00:44:52,980
not at all they like to red yellow and

1137
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:55,170
green chart that shows where we are who

1138
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:58,319
real simple you can laugh but they're

1139
00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:00,150
all about risk and money two things when

1140
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,880
you think of upper management risk and

1141
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:07,019
money and cyber security insurance is

1142
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,640
that a thing here in Europe it's huge in

1143
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:10,890
the States because of the cost that I

1144
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,480
mentioned earlier right cyber insurance

1145
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:15,150
is something that companies are buying

1146
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,400
sometimes the cost of a breach is more

1147
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,539
than the cyber insurance of any one

1148
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,930
company will give you you might have to

1149
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:24,239
get a second everyone but be aware that

1150
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:26,848
if you get cyber insurance they will

1151
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,559
make you sign and certify that you have

1152
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,779
this whole set of security controls in

1153
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,269
place and if the breach comes and they

1154
00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:35,549
do an investigation they find out oh we

1155
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:36,779
don't have a disaster recovery plan can

1156
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:41,910
anyone tell me what you think you will

1157
00:45:36,779 --> 00:45:44,670
get in your payment zero right so beware

1158
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:49,220
it comes with its own caveats thank you

1159
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,220
all very much go all wasp all right
