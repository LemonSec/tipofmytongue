1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,779
like the cat riding a unicorn portion

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,059
good morning everybody hopefully that

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,969
this talk will be able to wake you up a

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,518
little bit it's a very interesting topic

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:17,250
for an OAuth conference and it deals

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,259
with incident response for a very high

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,880
level incident that happened not too far

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:26,609
from here back in 2014 so to give you a

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,970
bit of a background of myself my actual

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,650
area of expertise is cyber warfare and I

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,500
advise various governments that you

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,680
Parliament the UK Parliament and so

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,059
forth on different types of strategy

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,000
dealing with technology to both protect

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:46,410
and kill people so it's kind of a fun

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,980
field for me and I started out being a

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,468
little script kitty as a 10 year old

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:56,760
because I just loved to hack things I

19
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,230
don't know why I just do so because this

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,108
is a no whilst talk I wanted to point

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,259
out some of the main portions of this

22
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,750
incident that hit on the various types

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,150
of the OWASP top 10 both for the web

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,340
application portion and for the IOT

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,760
portion for some of the hardware that

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,490
was affected and I think that the

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,220
various OS top tens are a very good way

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,520
to look at hey how can we avoid some

29
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,650
very basic to very high level incidents

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,810
and this type of incident that I'm about

31
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,710
to describe to you could have absolutely

32
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,570
been avoided

33
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:38,850
if they had looked at the OWASP top 10

34
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:40,979
so the way it started out was I used to

35
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,710
head the information protection group

36
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:46,290
for Aramco and the Saudi Aramco family

37
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,410
for Mia in Latin America and that

38
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,680
involved leading the sack the NOC and an

39
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,509
international intelligence group and one

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,060
day when I thought that I could actually

41
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,860
have a nice lunch because I didn't eat

42
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,620
very much at work there was always some

43
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,870
sort of putting out a fire a very large

44
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,820
man came up to me while I was eating a

45
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,860
spinach salad and I still had spinach

46
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,410
stuck in my teeth when he came

47
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,290
and he goes you need to come with me and

48
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,820
I'm like uh-oh maybe they found out that

49
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,700
I've been mining bitcoins on that

50
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,549
supercomputer hopefully it's not some

51
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,260
sort of family emergency instead he goes

52
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,600
no you need to come with me and I go

53
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,340
what's going on he goes well I'm not at

54
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,840
that level I don't know

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,490
and instead I was told that there was a

56
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,500
major incident at the Royal Saudi

57
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,350
Arabian embassy in The Hague

58
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,490
now at first it started out as something

59
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,590
very simple

60
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,620
unfortunately it grew to something very

61
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,990
very major and involved most of the

62
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,700
embassies of The Hague the Dutch

63
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,040
national terrorism police became

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,560
involved local police became involved as

65
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,530
well and the entire diplomatic corps

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,070
which is the diplomatic police which is

67
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,600
a separate law enforcement type of

68
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:04,260
agency that they have in many places in

69
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:07,769
the world now one thing to remember is

70
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:11,730
embassies are not a company they are not

71
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:14,790
your typical type of private entity they

72
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:18,988
are the sovereign property of a country

73
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,340
so local laws don't apply and the way

74
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,140
you have to deal with a crime that

75
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,730
happens at an embassy is completely

76
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,700
different than how you would handle it

77
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,320
if you are dealing with an incident at a

78
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:32,190
company or even just your regular

79
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,140
governmental office the dip the

80
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,269
diplomatic core has some very limited

81
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,700
jurisdiction in all of these matters and

82
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,400
the Ambassador is basically the king or

83
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,500
queen of that particular embassy and

84
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,900
everything that goes on and they are the

85
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,970
ones who have absolute final say if

86
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,650
anything moves forward with an outside

87
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:56,100
entity so there were four major

88
00:03:52,650 --> 00:04:00,780
incidents and I'll talk you through them

89
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:04,049
the first one involved and hack into the

90
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,420
business back-end email account of the

91
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:09,330
Saudi Arabian embassy of The Hague

92
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,540
and we found that there was a bit of

93
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,990
rootkit malware and it began with some

94
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:18,418
extortion demands that grew almost

95
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:20,470
exponentially as did also the physical

96
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,210
threats that were posed

97
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,620
he's in the beginning an email hack just

98
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,109
seems like a pretty simple thing

99
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,630
unfortunately in this particular case

100
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,520
the people that I was dealing with and

101
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,570
we were dealing with were not your

102
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:37,409
run-of-the-mill criminals so one of the

103
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,690
things we found I was able to take my

104
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:43,030
right hand forensics person on site at

105
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,790
the Embassy as we did some packet

106
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,619
captures along the business network not

107
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,510
the government intelligence network and

108
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,850
we found that there was a rootkit

109
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,140
installed on the particular network and

110
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,170
we could see it through the packet

111
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:59,229
captures and what's interesting about

112
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:04,750
this is if you are a nation-state and

113
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:07,270
you want to use a specialized tool these

114
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:10,290
types of tools cost quite a bit of money

115
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:14,380
and once you use them you burn them and

116
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:17,590
you can also identify hey this high-end

117
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,090
tool it wasn't coming from a commercial

118
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,609
off-the-shelf you can buy some malware

119
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,229
so it's got to be a nation-state in this

120
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,000
case the tool that was used was

121
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:28,630
something that you could buy and what we

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,300
call this is plausible deniability so we

123
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:34,180
believe that it was actually planted by

124
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,520
the insider who is a perpetrator who

125
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,820
unbeknownst to him was actually given

126
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,460
the malware by the Iranian government

127
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,790
now at the same time we were also having

128
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:49,060
some additional fun with drones this is

129
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,910
a quote I did with the NATO

130
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:55,030
secretary-general on cyber espionage and

131
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,580
if you think about this the moment that

132
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,409
you see a high-end tool it's burned and

133
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,870
that's one of the reasons why we think

134
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,010
that this particular malware was used so

135
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,550
that it couldn't be immediately

136
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:10,900
identified to the Iranian government now

137
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:14,470
at the same time my office up here was

138
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:17,580
right next to the Embassy of Yemen now

139
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:21,550
just prior to this particular incident

140
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:24,849
the Yemen's purchased the building that

141
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,860
they now have an embassy at with cash we

142
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,919
were not located in the embassy district

143
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,300
and it was quite unusual and our

144
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,818
investigators actually

145
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,860
had high suspicions that the Iranian

146
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:39,680
government gave them that money we also

147
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,930
caught the many embassy staff digging in

148
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,160
our backyard trying to get to our fiber

149
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:49,870
and trying to go ahead and surveil our

150
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,669
fiber we also caught Embassy employees

151
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:57,169
inside our building inside our canteen

152
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:59,690
or a cafeteria and one day I'm talking

153
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:02,359
to my boss and we're on the top floor

154
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:07,070
and he's got lovely nice glass behind

155
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:09,650
him and I suddenly see a drone well it

156
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:14,180
turns out that the Yemeni embassy

157
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:16,940
started to drone surveillance ort of

158
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,310
conversations and also to watch the ins

159
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:22,880
and outs of what was going on at our

160
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:25,580
office because Aramco is the National

161
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,830
Oil Company of Saudi Arabia and Saudi

162
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,020
Arabia and the Iranians are not friends

163
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,389
in Saudi Arabia and Yemen are not

164
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,508
friends either right now with various

165
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:37,130
rebel groups earlier this year and also

166
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:40,400
earlier this month there have been

167
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:43,550
rocket attacks and also bomb-laden

168
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,400
drones sent from Yemen by a rebel group

169
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:49,250
that is actually backed by the Iranian

170
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,109
government so drone activity with this

171
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,930
particular government or these two

172
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,610
governments is not that unusual now

173
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,009
because this was happening from an

174
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,680
embassy next door we couldn't actually

175
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:04,039
just contact the police we had to go

176
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,400
through diplomatic means and contact the

177
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:09,080
diplomatic corps to then have them

178
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,849
informed that they can fly whatever

179
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,849
drone they want over embassy property

180
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:15,560
but they cannot fly a drone over any

181
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:17,090
other property because it's illegal in

182
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,880
the Netherlands and that's where their

183
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:23,659
sovereign property ends is on their

184
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,810
property line so there are certain

185
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:28,370
reasons why I was chosen for this task

186
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,349
one of them was I was already working

187
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,690
for the Aramco family at a fairly high

188
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:35,390
level and I had a security team and a

189
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,599
very good security background another

190
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:41,208
reason was on a fairly frequent basis

191
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,729
for a number of years I've been able to

192
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:45,260
talk tech and change that around poor

193
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,020
management speak it

194
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,180
decorative speak and also I deal with a

195
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:53,810
lot of ministers and ambassadors on a

196
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,849
fairly regular basis so they do not

197
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,500
understand what a packet capture is you

198
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,300
will completely lose them and they will

199
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,280
wonder why you were even invited into

200
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,620
the room if you mention those words or

201
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,150
try to show them something like that so

202
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,740
you have to speak to them in a

203
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:09,319
completely different way using their

204
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:12,530
particular lingo that's just the way it

205
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,470
goes I also have a background with law

206
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:17,300
enforcement and not not just on the bad

207
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,310
to naughty side when I was busted as a

208
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,810
kid but also dealing with law

209
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,969
enforcement because I've dealt with a

210
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:29,270
lot of various cybercrime issues and

211
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,190
lastly at the time there's a right-wing

212
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,900
politician I'm sure all of the Dutch

213
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,600
people here are familiar with his name

214
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,579
is hurt builders and he had made some

215
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,610
videos which were quite offensive to the

216
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,590
Muslim world and it basically royally

217
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,960
pissed off the Saudis to the point where

218
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:47,480
they consoled a whole bunch of contracts

219
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,820
for Dutch companies and kicked a lot of

220
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,860
Dutch people out of Saudi Arabia because

221
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,160
of it so there was a problem with

222
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:58,190
geopolitics already going on now I

223
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,040
stress my forensics person came to me on

224
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,720
day one with me I should say but because

225
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,880
he was Dutch he could no longer come

226
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:10,700
back to the embassy only I could because

227
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:15,170
of my citizenship so how it started it

228
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:19,420
seemed like a pretty simple thing what's

229
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:22,670
going on well our email was hacked ok

230
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:26,870
well what was the password one two three

231
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:29,660
four five six I go excuse me this is

232
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,400
this is an embassy can you tell me that

233
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,819
again

234
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,530
one two three four five six okay that

235
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,020
was actually not what I was expecting

236
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,620
and it also turned out that they were

237
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:44,960
using a residential ISP with a

238
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,180
residential modem that had also never

239
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:50,690
been updated yeah

240
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:53,510
perfect for an embassy and to complicate

241
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:57,250
matters more the person who is the IT

242
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:59,780
person and was his very first week and

243
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:02,330
there was no handover from the other guy

244
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,550
and we could not get in touch with the

245
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,010
other guy at all we had no idea where he

246
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:09,770
was in the world he said yeah I'm at the

247
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:12,439
Embassy I'm on vacation goodbye so the

248
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,150
new guy had a lot of pressure on him

249
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,590
because of everything that was going on

250
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:21,160
and it began with an interesting thing

251
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:23,690
the Saudi Arabian embassy no longer

252
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,730
handles visa applications they have a

253
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:29,240
third party and so there was an email

254
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:32,510
sent asking hey can you help me with my

255
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,900
visa from a Saudi national and then it

256
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:39,230
became a bit unusual because of the

257
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,959
method of communicating if you send me

258
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,540
200 euros I'll expedite that for you and

259
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,760
you send it to MoneyGram how many people

260
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:53,390
here think that the MoneyGram is a valid

261
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:58,730
place nobody right and also with the

262
00:11:53,390 --> 00:12:00,949
email chain that the hacker started the

263
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:05,330
hackers started making it a bit personal

264
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:08,360
and try to defame the reputation of the

265
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:13,010
then Saudi Arabian ambassador to the

266
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:16,820
United Kingdom so this is what it looked

267
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:18,830
like and say hey you you you send my

268
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,290
money over and I will expedite

269
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:24,770
everything now to make matters a little

270
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:27,920
more inconvenient the person who said it

271
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:29,870
sent it a doctor's samaya al South is a

272
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,560
bit of a controversial figure from the

273
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:35,480
United Kingdom and it was at the point

274
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,479
when there was a mention of MoneyGram

275
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,130
that she contacted the Ambassador

276
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,530
directly and said hey I think there's

277
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,120
something going on with your secretary

278
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,189
because the Secretary to the Ambassador

279
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,440
was the only person that was supposed to

280
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,840
be allowed to handle any sort of embassy

281
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,660
email at this level and she's highly

282
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:58,490
trusted and a very very lovely person

283
00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:00,600
so that started the suspicion so we did

284
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,339
what you would usually do for basic and

285
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,779
we're like hey let's change the password

286
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,370
let's look at your equipment let's do

287
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,259
everything like that and let's lock you

288
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,990
down all right fine

289
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:12,449
then a week later I'm trying to eat

290
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,639
lunch again and the same very large man

291
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:17,758
and a very nice suit comes up to me and

292
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,850
goes I've come here to summon you again

293
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,319
and I'm like I'm never gonna eat lunch I

294
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,610
am never gonna eat lunch

295
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:28,410
as long as I work here unfortunately

296
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,389
because of my citizenship

297
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,819
I had limited access to all of their

298
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:36,839
systems and most embassies many

299
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:38,729
embassies not all embassies are also an

300
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,259
intelligence function and this is very

301
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,860
much the same with the Saudi Arabian

302
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:45,990
embassy and I had to be limited to what

303
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,459
I could actually look at so I could only

304
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,230
look at the business portion out the

305
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:52,410
intelligence network portion which is

306
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,329
fine unfortunately though with the

307
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,639
limited amount of access I couldn't see

308
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:59,219
everything that was going on so it turns

309
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,250
out that the attacker was still in the

310
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,079
system and although we had done all

311
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,380
sorts of different changes the

312
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:10,888
persistent little was still in there

313
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,500
and at this time the amount of money

314
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:16,560
started going up and instead of being

315
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,410
hey we'll expedite your visa there was

316
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,000
instead an email sent to certain Middle

317
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:29,370
Eastern countries in the country of

318
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:31,920
Turkey asking for 25,000 euro so it was

319
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,699
a friendly email which is the best way

320
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:38,160
to describe it it was also signed

321
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:41,459
friends of Isis and it came from the

322
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,250
Royal Saudi Arabian business email

323
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:45,810
address to the other embassies now this

324
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,430
obviously is not a good thing if you're

325
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,849
an embassy and someone is saying that

326
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:57,239
other embassies need to pay 25k to save

327
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:59,269
many lives Friends of Isis and this was

328
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,410
starting to affect the back-channel

329
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:03,810
reputation of the Saudi Arabian embassy

330
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,790
at this point luckily there were a

331
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:09,119
couple of countries that were very

332
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:11,160
cooperative and allowed me to take

333
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,750
samples of their data to see if there

334
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,879
was any difference in the emails

335
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,930
how many hops all sorts of different

336
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:22,269
things because only using one sample

337
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,790
it's much easier to look at all the

338
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:27,399
evidence and so two countries were very

339
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:29,250
cooperative and I'm very thankful for

340
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,569
that because it helped in the long run

341
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,970
this is actually what the email looked

342
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:36,849
like and they were they were nice enough

343
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:41,050
to actually sign it Isis as well I mean

344
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:43,300
obviously this is sanitized but yes so

345
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:46,209
this was not a good thing coming from of

346
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:52,329
all countries the embassy of Saudi

347
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:55,839
Arabia so the diplomatic corps they were

348
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:57,250
trying to be very proactive and I really

349
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,079
enjoyed working with them but they made

350
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,480
one key mistake which I think a lot of

351
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:04,870
us have made before I myself have made

352
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:09,699
this particular mistake before using CC

353
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:12,279
instead of BCC right so the diplomatic

354
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:14,680
police are like hey all the embassies of

355
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,470
the Hague and your official back-channel

356
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,469
emails listen we've been hearing about

357
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,660
these extortion attempts for 25k if you

358
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,490
happen to get any of them go ahead and

359
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,469
forward them to us and we'll see if we

360
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:30,850
can help right it was really helpful

361
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:32,980
except it was CC and the attacker was

362
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:37,120
still on the back end of the system at

363
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:39,730
this time so it exposed all of the email

364
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,839
addresses for all of the embassies in

365
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:49,600
the hague and the perpetrators replied

366
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:52,120
back to everyone and said hey glad we

367
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,910
have your attention now we're gonna

368
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,339
start putting the money up thank you so

369
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,699
much diplomatic corps we're enjoying

370
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:04,169
this and they began to taunt the

371
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:07,539
diplomatic corps back-and-forth

372
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:10,720
carbon-copy all of the embassies in the

373
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:15,879
hague right so this is where things

374
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:17,500
started getting real interesting and

375
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,089
this was not a good thing because a lot

376
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,650
of the other embassies you either have a

377
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,300
friendly relationship a strained

378
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,280
relationship or I hate you

379
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:28,300
and this is just the way it works

380
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:30,430
there's a great book about some of the

381
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,720
relationships between various countries

382
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:37,060
and it's called governments that hate me

383
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,680
and it explains in depth why certain

384
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:43,510
governments do not work together

385
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:46,570
whatsoever but this also began a big

386
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:49,629
problem because several of the embassies

387
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:52,240
are like we're getting kind of scared

388
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,400
because Isis is involved and Isis

389
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,210
sometimes kills people instead of just

390
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,790
extorting them so and in the background

391
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,790
we were able to keep it quiet in the

392
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,830
press and this is where the Dutch

393
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,980
terrorism police at a national level

394
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:12,189
began to get involved and they began

395
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:14,410
rolling out plainclothes security around

396
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:17,950
the embassy section of The Hague and

397
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:19,390
other stretched other embassies that

398
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,670
aren't in the area like the Irish

399
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:24,250
Embassy for example is right next to the

400
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:28,120
beach of Traven and which I completely

401
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:29,770
butchered that name that's okay so the

402
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,659
security started being quietly

403
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:37,000
heightened all throughout the hague

404
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:39,340
because of this now the perpetrator

405
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,280
decided to make it even more personal

406
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:44,230
after the taunting of the diplomatic

407
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,740
police and the rest of the embassies and

408
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:50,140
the perpetrator actually broke into the

409
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:54,430
secretary to the ambassador's personal

410
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:57,820
gmail account and began sending physical

411
00:18:54,430 --> 00:19:00,700
threats as well as upping the amount of

412
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,830
extortion that they wanted this

413
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,330
obviously scared this secretary to the

414
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,649
point where she contacted the local

415
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:09,730
police to file various police reports

416
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,650
fortunately she tried to file three

417
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:15,730
times but we had to quash those

418
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:19,180
particular police reports due to the

419
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,980
entire situation and the Dutch local

420
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,190
police were very cooperative at the time

421
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,840
however they did try to make sure that

422
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,460
they were watching out for her because

423
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,379
she liked to go jogging and things like

424
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,110
that

425
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:36,470
so we tried our best to make her feel

426
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:40,110
safe as much as possible so the will say

427
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:44,789
signed Isis perpetrator then started

428
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:48,090
saying hey I want 35 million u.s.

429
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:51,450
dollars and various you know currency

430
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:54,860
and gold and so forth or bad things are

431
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:58,650
going to happen now

432
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:01,740
the perpetrator finally threatened a

433
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:04,200
maximum of 50 million or we're going to

434
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,960
blow up the ker house now the Kerr house

435
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,650
is a national landmark on I'll try to

436
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:14,400
say correctly Traven which is a beach

437
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:16,320
off the hague and this is where the rich

438
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,419
and famous wealthy people would stay

439
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,710
before they went on their cruises before

440
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:24,720
airplanes were big and a lot of people

441
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:29,270
go there it's a tourist attraction on

442
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:32,280
the beach it's a lovely place however

443
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,870
there had been a national Saudi Day

444
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,840
celebration that was planned for the

445
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:39,030
Kerr house and when a country does a

446
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,100
national celebration then there's

447
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:44,309
usually lots of dignitary there was some

448
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,469
Dutch royalty invited you had the

449
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:49,260
Ambassador from the US the Ambassador

450
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,330
from the UK ambassador from Japan so on

451
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:55,860
and so forth which are all invited

452
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:59,250
dignitaries so these are vvvv VIP folks

453
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:03,689
who have a lot of pool in the rest of

454
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:06,809
the world and the final big threat was

455
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:10,289
if you do not pay me 50 million US

456
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:14,309
dollars by this date we will blow up the

457
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:17,490
Kerr house and kill everybody in it now

458
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:20,580
obviously when a national landmark and

459
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:23,490
such a public area is threatened this

460
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:26,158
heightened security even more in the

461
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:29,280
hague area and we were still able to

462
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,640
keep it kind of quiet while at the same

463
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:36,240
time lots of security was around the

464
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,400
city both public and private and we

465
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,840
began to get around the Saudi Arabian

466
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,440
embassy our

467
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,168
and fully armed with rifles and so forth

468
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,480
police presence around our embassy in

469
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:51,330
our office as well as a few other key

470
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:56,700
embassies that had also been originally

471
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:59,340
threatened and this was not a hmm

472
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,470
a very nice thing because although our

473
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,970
Dutch police are armed you're just not

474
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:08,429
used to seeing such a presence around

475
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:11,809
now here's where it got very very

476
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:16,850
strange and it took a very weird twist

477
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:19,678
so as we're dealing with the perpetrator

478
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,949
giving us a lot of threats and I'm

479
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,200
trying to negotiate with the perpetrator

480
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,490
I used to go out to this pub which was

481
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,470
right around my house in the hague

482
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,720
called Sherlock switch was voted the

483
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:35,279
best British pub in the Netherlands of

484
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,649
all things and I come in one evening

485
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:40,860
because this is stressful so I kind of

486
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:42,299
like a beer or two and the owner happen

487
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,918
to be the bartender that a thing goes

488
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,510
these three gentlemen have been waiting

489
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,640
for you and they've been sitting there

490
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,649
for two to three hours just sipping tea

491
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,429
because they did not drink alcohol and

492
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:54,989
it turns out they were all cultural

493
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:57,450
attache is assigned to the Turkish

494
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:59,789
embassy well this is interesting

495
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,940
I'm not Turkish I've been a turkey a few

496
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:04,980
times but okay and they go what we've

497
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,690
been waiting for you to give us English

498
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:11,190
lessons we wanted to ask you if you

499
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:14,789
would give us English lessons but you

500
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:18,480
speak English I don't understand why

501
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:21,000
would you ask me so this was kind of

502
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,340
strange I kind of like to refer to them

503
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,120
as a dumb dumber and dumbest and tell

504
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,770
agents I've ever run into unfortunately

505
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,350
but there were certain reasons why they

506
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:32,370
were kind of assigned to me one of the

507
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,928
reasons why there are so many

508
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,120
journalists that are arrested in Turkey

509
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:38,700
and sometimes disappeared was when they

510
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,510
tried to report on some of the illicit

511
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,970
activities involving rawand son who it's

512
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:46,950
kind of well-known in certain circles

513
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:51,330
especially diplomatic circles that a lot

514
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,610
of the Isis oil big caravans come from

515
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,500
seer

516
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:55,899
come through Turkey and then suddenly

517
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,770
it's old and herbal and Sun makes a lot

518
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:01,450
of money as well as his friends so there

519
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,450
were certain vested interests and

520
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:07,030
keeping an eye on me and it was at this

521
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:09,850
time that the security services also

522
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:14,170
informed me that they had found the list

523
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:16,809
an Isis high profile or hight target

524
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:19,000
kidnap list and I was number two on that

525
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:23,950
list because I guess they wanted to

526
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,809
kidnap me and hold me for ransom so I

527
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,240
was assigned I I don't like close

528
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:30,790
protection personally like I don't want

529
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,010
close protection bodyguards in my house

530
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:36,668
that that kind of puts a damper on

531
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:39,549
things but I was assigned distant

532
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:41,830
protection to keep an eye on me and also

533
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:43,799
anytime especially that I meant with

534
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,330
these three Turkish agents and

535
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:49,780
everything that I discussed with them

536
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:52,659
had to be reported back and every

537
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:55,000
evening for about two and a half weeks I

538
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,940
had to engage with these particular

539
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,250
Turkish agents now it's words the end of

540
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,340
the two and a half weeks one of them

541
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:06,730
more senior gave me a very unusual gift

542
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:10,240
I am NOT Muslim and obviously I'm a

543
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:11,950
woman and he gave me as something that

544
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,530
is not typical for someone you don't

545
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:16,840
know very well and he gave me these

546
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:20,049
beautiful prayer beads from fine wood

547
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,970
which was very nice and I immediately

548
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:25,780
handed it over to security services to

549
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:27,340
check for bugs because sometimes gifts

550
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,830
are more than a gift I think we all

551
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:34,178
remember the story of the Trojan horse

552
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:37,330
right so suddenly after about two and a

553
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:39,760
half weeks they disappeared they were no

554
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:42,189
longer waiting for me four hours for me

555
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:46,330
to get off work drinking tea at a pub

556
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:49,059
and turns out I was informed that all

557
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:51,040
three of them actually left the country

558
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:56,830
all at the same time and went back to

559
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:59,740
Turkey so there were no more very odd

560
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:03,360
kind of slightly creepy Turkish Intel

561
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:07,170
agents asking me for English lessons

562
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,909
now we started to suspect because of the

563
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:11,010
personal nature of the attack and also

564
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:13,140
going after the ambassador's Secretary's

565
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:15,180
personal email account that this could

566
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,610
actually be an insider it was actually

567
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,040
the Ambassador from first suggested it

568
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,050
because he suspected two people but one

569
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:26,190
person in particular from various

570
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:28,350
reasons and one evening after all the

571
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:31,260
rest of the staff left it was just me

572
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:34,649
the ambassador and his bodyguards and

573
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:37,860
the Ambassador was so eager because of

574
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:39,960
the various threats to try to figure out

575
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,429
if this insider was an insider he

576
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,070
started getting down on his hands and

577
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:45,840
knees reaching underneath desks looking

578
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,100
for post-it notes for credentials so

579
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,350
that we could get into that person's

580
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,080
account without them knowing and I'd

581
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:54,689
never and I don't think I'll ever see

582
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,820
this again in my life an ambassador just

583
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,460
getting amongst the dust and doing the

584
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,470
same kinds of things that most of us do

585
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:06,800
on a fairly regular basis so it was

586
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:09,930
quite an unusual thing and we began to

587
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,300
trace some of the various messages that

588
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:16,620
were coming from different places that

589
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:18,780
the perpetrator was sending and starting

590
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:22,889
to build a profile on this particular

591
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:26,340
individual and as it got closer and

592
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:28,680
closer I was able to take embassy

593
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:31,350
property home with me which is quite

594
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,360
unusual so I was very trusted and after

595
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,790
about 15 minutes and a half a glass of

596
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,709
wine I figured out that the attacker was

597
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:40,620
still on the back end with an email

598
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:43,440
forwarder and we were able to get the

599
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:46,350
attacker out and some additional emails

600
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,020
were sent from a Yandex account we tried

601
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,459
to use diplomatic means to go through

602
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,620
the various hops to get additional

603
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:56,580
information and evidence and we were

604
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:59,580
finally able to pinpoint the perpetrator

605
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,080
in one particular neighborhood a close

606
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,760
neighborhood in The Hague and that's

607
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,290
where the main suspect actually lived so

608
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:11,550
the ambassador's suspicions were most

609
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:14,010
likely correct and that particular

610
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:17,519
individual was also for

611
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:20,100
I will say a powerful family back in

612
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,389
Saudi and you can't just fire an

613
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,769
individual like that

614
00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:27,510
so instead after we paid and I do want

615
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:30,570
to stress no ransom was ever excuse me

616
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:33,059
extortion was ever paid but the person

617
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:35,820
had to be taken care of in a different

618
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:38,760
way so this particular individual was

619
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:41,539
reassigned to an extremely physically

620
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:44,460
dangerous location in the world and

621
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:47,970
unfortunately within a couple of weeks

622
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:50,519
of his new assignment he was the only

623
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:55,590
person killed in a particular car bomb

624
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:58,500
in this particular country so modern

625
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:04,110
problems require modern solutions that's

626
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:06,960
all I can say now because of this and

627
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:09,750
because of the work I did and also my

628
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,149
forensics person did I got a few cool

629
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,919
rewards which is kind of nice because it

630
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:15,570
was very stressful they had actually

631
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,600
lasted for about two and a half months

632
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:23,490
the entire incident that's a long time

633
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:27,059
for an incident to last I was invited to

634
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:31,380
this posh private dinner by the

635
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:34,470
Ambassador as he was leaving and was at

636
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:37,139
the Rijksmuseum where he can rent it out

637
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,299
and dine in front of the night watchmen

638
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:41,070
and that was quite cool although it was

639
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:44,029
a bit sick that night so I couldn't have

640
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:48,178
any of the posh wine I could only just

641
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:50,789
almost had it almost had it and the

642
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:53,730
Ambassador he had an awards kind of

643
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:55,889
ceremony during the dinner and myself

644
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:59,309
and a few other people were given

645
00:29:55,889 --> 00:30:00,840
various gifts and so forth at the

646
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:04,710
Rijksmuseum so it was quite an awesome

647
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:07,080
evening I must say and yeah I got to

648
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:10,080
schmooze even though it was sick with a

649
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,519
bunch of dignitaries and pretend to

650
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,510
almost drink wine so that was kind of

651
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:18,210
cool and there were a few lessons that I

652
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:21,090
learned from this and one of them is

653
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:23,399
when you've got an incident you might

654
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:25,080
think it could be basic but sometimes it

655
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:26,570
can actually be intertwined in

656
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,070
geopolitics

657
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,769
and you have to look at the entire

658
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:33,740
picture especially if you work for

659
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:36,740
certain types of organizations or if you

660
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:39,350
happen to be a pivot into certain

661
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:41,419
organizations and you're not aware of it

662
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:45,320
think about accounting software in the

663
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:47,960
Ukraine is a good example another one is

664
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,178
when you've got a major incident and it

665
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,149
involves a terrorist group or a cyber

666
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:56,029
terrorist group or someone insane or a

667
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:58,370
group that isn't very nice it can

668
00:30:56,029 --> 00:31:00,440
actually result in real human

669
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:05,209
consequences and real people can be

670
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:08,029
affected safety life and limb and be

671
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,419
aware that incidents can have a major

672
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:12,889
impact on people like that

673
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:14,299
another one is if you ever get gifts

674
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:16,008
from a foreign government always have

675
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:18,190
them checked that's always a good idea

676
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:20,480
you never know

677
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:22,669
after they checked out my prayer beads

678
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,409
and they said nothing was in him I

679
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:26,179
actually still have them at home and

680
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:29,480
they gave them back so that was kind of

681
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:33,850
cool so I keep them as a souvenir to

682
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:39,139
remind me of my Turkish Intel friends

683
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:42,049
another thing is depending on your role

684
00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:45,168
in an organization you can be placed at

685
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:50,330
high risk and it's always a good idea to

686
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:53,000
try to sit your closest family down and

687
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:56,289
describe it because they are what we

688
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,509
call the closest hop and sometimes a

689
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:03,169
naughty person can use your closest hop

690
00:31:59,509 --> 00:32:05,059
to get to you and because of my military

691
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:06,620
background I'm not used to discussing

692
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:08,629
these types of things with anyone close

693
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:11,330
to me and it was a very strange

694
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:14,750
conversation when two years later I told

695
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:19,220
my then partner that this had been going

696
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:23,019
on and he had had no idea we'll say it

697
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:25,970
was a discussion with some raised voices

698
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:28,460
but anyway try to make them aware

699
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:32,179
because they could also be targeted to

700
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:35,210
get to you and last but not least when

701
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:37,279
you find yourself in a situation that

702
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:40,070
can be quite dangerous always try to

703
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,720
stay calm because if you don't

704
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,610
when you're involved in an incident and

705
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,550
you're an incident manager you're the

706
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:48,169
one person that is trying to calm all

707
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,169
the chaos the managers are going to be

708
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:53,360
screaming because they like to scream

709
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:55,940
but you have to calm people down calm

710
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,969
that chaos if you don't then it will get

711
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:01,010
way more chaotic and if you're faced in

712
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:04,640
a situation like this it could actually

713
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:05,750
cost lives including your own so try to

714
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,470
take a deep breath

715
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:13,610
think about the OWASP top 10 all right

716
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:16,160
and then it's all good so I did try to

717
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:18,110
leave time for questions and I noticed

718
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,650
there's a whole bunch of people Martin

719
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:25,330
has a microphone so start raising your

720
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:31,510
hands and thank you very much everybody

721
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:34,870
[Applause]

722
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,870
any questions

723
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:41,090
gotta be a few come up to me I don't

724
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:46,070
have to run all the way I'm not reading

725
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:48,189
more all right

726
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:51,080
so in the context of the car bomb viewer

727
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:52,640
mentioning that modern questions require

728
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,850
modern solutions I wanted to know what

729
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,820
exactly you find modern about that

730
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:58,820
[Laughter]

731
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:08,050
sometimes you people have to be

732
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,929
reassigned in situations where they can

733
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:15,550
basically be neutralized and that was

734
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:21,960
what had to occur so modern problems

735
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:24,400
require modern solutions yes questions

736
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,440
okay yeah use tables that's the whole

737
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,090
day I think yep I'll be around the whole

738
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,679
day okay

739
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:32,590
as you might have noticed all the talks

740
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,739
taquitos and the speaker sessions all

741
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:37,660
stars are recorded and will be online so

742
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:39,669

743
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:41,859

745
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,449
Chris

746
