1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,290
thank you very much for the introduction

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,969
and thanks to all of you for being here

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:15,800
so indeed my name is Miko I am from

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:18,779
Finland and I will be speaking about

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:23,490
where we're going there's really a nice

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:26,429
echo in the room well I can cut to the

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,429
chase right away I do believe that there

8
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,769
is job security in security the things

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,260
we've been doing for the last decades

10
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,820
aren't going to go anywhere sometimes I

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,399
get questions about this and you know

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,260
aren't you working in an industry that

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,390
if you're really good at what you do you

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,718
make yourself irrelevant like you will

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,820
engineer yourself out of a job and

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,890
that's true like if we actually are able

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,430
to do that if we actually would be able

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,320
to build vulnerable or systems which

19
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,539
have no vulnerabilities if we would

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,890
actually be able to fix every buck we

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,109
would actually be able to stop every

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,210
attack we would all be out of a job but

23
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,550
of course that's not going to happen

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,340
because in the end it's not really a

25
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:11,039
question about technical vulnerabilities

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,710
or whether people can be fooled to do

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,110
stupid things it's really a question

28
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,279
about whether there will be bad people

29
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,990
in the future

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,150
and I can tell you there will be bad

31
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,699
people in the future like there's always

32
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,420
been and if there is an opportunity for

33
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,940
a criminal to make a lot of money in a

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,120
way where it's very unlikely for them to

35
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:37,140
be caught or sentenced someone somewhere

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,390
is going to do it an Internet took away

37
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,370
geography I've been discussing

38
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,430
statistics in many different countries

39
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:46,500
with local law enforcement and we are

40
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,870
depending on the country but we are on

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,690
the verge whether it's now more likely

42
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:54,750
for the citizens to become a victim of a

43
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:58,470
crime in the real world or in the online

44
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,140
world for those of us living in Western

45
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,780
safe societies like for example in the

46
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,520
Netherlands the likelihood that you

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,950
become a victim of a real-world crime

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,590
exists but it's not very high especially

49
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,570
when you compare to I don't know South

50
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,840
America or Africa or places like that

51
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:17,640
where real world

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:21,190
is much more common but when we leave

53
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,399
the real world when we go to the online

54
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:28,410
world then we are no longer in the

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,780
Netherlands or in any physical location

56
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:34,420
it's easy to say that internet takes

57
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,150
away geography and it takes away borders

58
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,190
because that's what it does but it's

59
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,970
harder to really understand what it

60
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:45,129
means for our risk level Internet is the

61
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,620
best thing that has happened during our

62
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:49,209
lifetime and the worst thing that has

63
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,160
happened during our lifetime the

64
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:54,280
Internet is the legacy we will be

65
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,069
leaving behind when people let's say

66
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,610
hundreds of years in the future we'll

67
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:03,190
look back at our time the early 2000s

68
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:06,160
the number one thing they will think

69
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,980
about us is that those were the people

70
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,959
who first went online these were the

71
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,720
first people online that's the big thing

72
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,639
that's gonna stay in history books about

73
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:22,510
our time that's gonna be our legacy and

74
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:25,269
we have all lived through multiple

75
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,010
technological revolutions multiple

76
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:30,450
technological revolutions during our

77
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:34,540
lifetime mobile phones computers

78
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:36,790
internet now IOT they're all shaping the

79
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:42,930
world around us and this is happening

80
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:45,608
very very quickly so I live in Finland

81
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,489
Finland has 1,600 kilometer of border

82
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:51,639
with the Russians I work in security we

83
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:54,190
do a lot of work we are researching what

84
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:56,549
the Russian attackers are doing both

85
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,829
criminal as well as governmental

86
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:02,410
attackers because as things we've always

87
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:06,609
known we have to keep a close eye on the

88
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:08,668
Russians both my grandfather's fought

89
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:13,530
the Russians in the Second World War

90
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:16,959
my mother Roja was born two months after

91
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,269
the peace treaty in 1945 that's why she

92
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,450
was called Brava Roja is the Finnish

93
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:25,750
word for peace she was born two months

94
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,450
after the peace was agreed on and she

95
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:32,970
was named flower she

96
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:35,099
went to work with computers in 1968 1969

97
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,500
I was working with computers in 1968 my

98
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,300
mother was I was born in 1969 myself

99
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,310
which means when I was a young boy I

100
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,550
would play around the house with punch

101
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:51,480
cards and punch tape that my mom would

102
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:54,870
bring home from work fifty years is a

103
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,400
long time but in technology it has

104
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,890
changed everything

105
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,320
fifty years ago we went to the mall we

106
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,490
were celebrating the 50th anniversary of

107
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:08,040
the moon landing just two months ago and

108
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:10,500
next month in October we will be

109
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,730
celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of

110
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:19,320
this this is a notebook an IM p log

111
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:23,010
notebook dated october 1969 and it has a

112
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:26,340
line in it on the 29th of october 1969

113
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:30,180
at 10:30 p.m. in the evening first

114
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:33,000
packet on ARPANET which would later

115
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,430
become the Internet was successfully

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,760
sent from one computer to another the

117
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:43,070
first packet will celebrate the fiftieth

118
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:46,110
anniversary on the 29th of next month I

119
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,640
told you I was born in 1969 I was born a

120
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,070
little bit before this I'm actually

121
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,880
older than the Internet this is how old

122
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:57,060
Internet is right that's what it looks

123
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,440
like and fifty years well of course to

124
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,230
me it's a long time I've been alive for

125
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,440
a very long while I think but when you

126
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:06,570
look at development of mankind and our

127
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,219
history and how technology shapes the

128
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,920
world around us this is nothing

129
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,520
things have changed very very quickly

130
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:17,870
and the internet revolution is already

131
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,590
behind us the internet revolution

132
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,590
already happened

133
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,169
I'll be working for f-secure for a very

134
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:30,189
long time I joined the company as

135
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:33,729
employee number six in 1991 now we have

136
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:35,889
1700 1800 people around the world and in

137
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:38,349
many ways our work has changed but in

138
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:41,439
some ways it hasn't for example every

139
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:43,479
morning we go to our office we sit down

140
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,639
at a table where we have a computer

141
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:47,530
having bang on the keyboard all day and

142
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,379
then we go home this is what we were

143
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,508
doing in 1991 this is what we do today

144
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:55,779
but there is one big difference which

145
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:58,990
nicely illustrates how the internet

146
00:06:55,779 --> 00:07:01,389
revolution already happened in 1991 when

147
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,879
I was doing my daily work at the office

148
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:07,090
if I needed to move files from one

149
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,939
computer to another we did not have a

150
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,739
local area network obviously we didn't

151
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:13,840
have internet because of course in 1991

152
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,960
nobody had internet like that but we

153
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,090
didn't even have a lab I mean we were an

154
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,948
IT company and we didn't have a local

155
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,710
area network we got our first lan in the

156
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:25,479
end of 1992 which means if you wanted to

157
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,539
move files around you were using the

158
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:31,990
thumb drive of the 1990s to move them

159
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:34,599
around and this is what the revolution

160
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,360
really means we've had computers for

161
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:40,089
decades what the internet revolution did

162
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,969
was that it took every single computer

163
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:44,830
on the planet to the Internet and this

164
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:47,020
has already happened it's very hard to

165
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,500
find a computer anymore which is not

166
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,729
online

167
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:55,650
every computer is online and now we are

168
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:59,500
in the beginning of the next revolution

169
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:01,448
which is the IOT revolution or the

170
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,870
revolution of connected devices and this

171
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:09,819
is in the very beginning because it's

172
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:14,319
not about smart devices it's more about

173
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:16,449
stupid devices smart devices we all know

174
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,400
the risks I am the father of the hoopin

175
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:21,039
and law which says that if it's smart

176
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,349
it's vulnerable which is a very easy law

177
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,789
to justify when you add functionality

178
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:27,759
and connectivity into everyday devices

179
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:29,979
like televisions or fridges they

180
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,760
inherently become hackable because now

181
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:37,510
they're running code now they are online

182
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:41,080
but at least the consumers who buy smart

183
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,939
fridges or smart televisions know that

184
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,040
these things are online the reason why

185
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,230
they buy them is that they are online

186
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,150
the reason why people buy smart

187
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,130
televisions is that they want to watch

188
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,990
Netflix on their TV the reason why

189
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,370
people buy smart fridges is that they

190
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,260
when they're shopping they want to be

191
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,110
able to look inside of their fridge with

192
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:02,560
a built-in webcam these are features

193
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:05,740
which users want but what's gonna happen

194
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,079
in the very near future is that devices

195
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:11,050
which are not smart will be going online

196
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,340
as well devices where the consumers

197
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:17,050
don't need the things to be online

198
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:20,590
stupid things things like toasters we

199
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:23,709
don't need our toasters on the Internet

200
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:27,010
we don't need an app to tell us that the

201
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:29,110
toast is done we don't need that but

202
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,360
they're gonna be online anyway and

203
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,430
they're gonna be online and everything

204
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,310
will be online and everything will

205
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:43,060
become a computer because data is money

206
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,839
data has become money money has also

207
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,530
become data

208
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:50,170
thanks to cryptocurrencies but data has

209
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:52,510
also what concretely become valuable

210
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:56,079
maybe it's just a different version of

211
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:58,420
the data is the new oil saying or data

212
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,980
is radium saying which is even better

213
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,620
because uranium is very valuable and

214
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,250
very problematic just like data is very

215
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,220
valuable and very problematic

216
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:11,260
nevertheless data is valuable

217
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:14,020
this means that toaster manufacturers

218
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,220
among others one to call it data they

219
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,410
would call it it already

220
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,290
today if they could but they can't

221
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,990
because it's still too expensive but in

222
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,300
the very near future it won't be in the

223
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,460
very near future the cost of adding

224
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,079
connectivity and functionality for

225
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,940
collecting and sending data is going to

226
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,640
be insignificant you can add it to any

227
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,390
device which uses electricity and then

228
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,340
they will and that means that consumers

229
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:43,090
who buy these things in their homes

230
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:45,630
won't even be told that this thing that

231
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:48,210
you bought actually is online because

232
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:51,030
not online for the consumer it's online

233
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:53,580
for the manufacturer and there won't be

234
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:56,670
any easy way of preventing this because

235
00:10:53,580 --> 00:11:00,270
you can't block these devices on your

236
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:02,069
gateway because they won't be using your

237
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,930
Wi-Fi or in any of the connectivity

238
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,540
channels that you control they're gonna

239
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,719
be online using five g6g

240
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,510
SiC Fox ZigBee three any of these new

241
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:17,730
technologies that we are developing

242
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:22,950
right now so what's the problem well the

243
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:26,370
problem is these things compete with

244
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:28,890
price chiefest wins when you go buying

245
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,550
toasters the number one selling point is

246
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:34,710
price you're not asking questions about

247
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:37,650
well I wonder what kind of a firewall is

248
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:40,970
built into my toaster no especially if

249
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,970
you don't even know it's online

250
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:48,129
and we have over the years had the

251
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,810
tendency of coming up with great

252
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:53,569
innovations which initially seemed like

253
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:56,349
a great idea and then much much later we

254
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:59,979
realized that they were a horrible idea

255
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:05,480
let me show this by playing you a TV ad

256
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:07,639
from 1960s smart woman she's putting a

257
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,339
new floor down by herself wise woman

258
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,829
she's using Ken tile vinyl asbestos tile

259
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:15,170
easy exploring to install easiest

260
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:19,939
flooring to care for save every way with

261
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:24,410
Ken tile vinyl asbestos tile this smart

262
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:26,410
woman was using asbestos tiles asbestos

263
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,750
which was such a great innovation

264
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:32,149
miracle material which you could you

265
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,610
know shape in any form you wanted which

266
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:38,300
wouldn't catch fire which were great for

267
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:40,790
insulation and also as we discovered

268
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,769
later horrible for our health and we're

269
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,879
battling with asbestos problems even

270
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:49,279
still today and what we are doing right

271
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:54,680
now could be characterized as IT

272
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:58,160
asbestos the idea where we put

273
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:01,279
everything on line turn everything into

274
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,670
a computer with the cheapest possible

275
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:08,029
technology embedding an outdated Linux

276
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:11,420
kernel which cannot be patched by the

277
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:13,490
users with built-in root passwords which

278
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,309
cannot be changed by the user and then

279
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:19,430
putting these by the millions into the

280
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:22,759
open Internet with all ports exposed

281
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:24,949
this will be the asbestos of the future

282
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:26,930
this will be the problem that our

283
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:29,449
children and future generations will

284
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:32,269
curse us for and this is what we are

285
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:35,839
doing right now it seems like a great

286
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:39,050
idea right now to me it sounds like it

287
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:43,399
could come back to haunt us and in some

288
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:48,500
ways it's already happening last week we

289
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:49,790
released our latest report on on threat

290
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,030
detection

291
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:55,670
our half-a-year report which included

292
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:57,199
what we see on our honey pots we run a

293
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,800
club or network of honeypot which

294
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,030
collect attacker traffic and for the

295
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,339
last 20 years

296
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:06,589
number one detections on those honey

297
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,650
pots have of course being Windows

298
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:13,430
malware Windows worms windows box the

299
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:17,689
usual well in the latest report for the

300
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:22,430
first time ever its lytics line looks is

301
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:24,170
finally mainstream instead of Windows

302
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,790
detection is being number one on our

303
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,469
honey pots we're now seeing line of

304
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:31,040
detections as number one and of course

305
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,530
these are IOT detections we're not

306
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,110
speaking about malware worms and box

307
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:39,170
spreading on desktop or server Linux

308
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:42,190
distributions these are ilt bare-bones

309
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:45,670
line of installations nevertheless it is

310
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:50,810
linux malware for the first time ever

311
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:52,579
and we see old protocols come back to

312
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:56,239
haunt us the kind of problems that we

313
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:59,030
already fixed and solved a long long

314
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,530
time ago come back to haunt us big part

315
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:05,390
of this traffic that we're seeing is

316
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:09,140
actually telnet traffic tell me god damn

317
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:13,220
telnet traffic we haven't been using

318
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:15,199
telnet on our servers since 1990s

319
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,300
because it's a horribly bad idea it's an

320
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,300
unencrypted terminal protocol which was

321
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,609
completely replaced by SSH in the

322
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,819
mid-1990s now for some reason that I

323
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,890
can't explain these new IOT debating

324
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,690
devices are running till empty and we

325
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,240
have talent worms going around the world

326
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,260
in massive numbers again I thought we

327
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,630
fixed this already

328
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:46,280
apparently we did it slightly asbestos

329
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:48,800
at work another thing which will stay

330
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,709
with us in the future that we are about

331
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,240
to enter is the fact that attacks can be

332
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:57,800
divided into either technical attacks or

333
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,900
people attacks that's not going to

334
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,990
change because you can take any single

335
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,000
attack we've ever seen and you can

336
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,650
either

337
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,140
divided into a technical problem or a

338
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,300
people problem either it was a buck in

339
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,029
the code which then became a more

340
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,640
ability which must been exploited by

341
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:20,710
someone or it was a human which was

342
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:23,480
tricked to do something stupid sometimes

343
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:25,040
people ask me - how come we can't make

344
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,480
systems which wouldn't have

345
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,750
vulnerabilities and then I have to

346
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,339
explain to them that you know

347
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:34,610
vulnerabilities aren't anything special

348
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:36,950
there just bucks and we've always had

349
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,350
bucks and we always will have bugs as

350
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:44,360
long as programs are written by human

351
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:46,670
beings because people make mistakes we

352
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,500
could argue that one day programs will

353
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,870
not be written by human beings one day

354
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,779
they will be written by machine learning

355
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:56,240
systems and artificial intelligence then

356
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,800
maybe we will finally have a day where

357
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,990
we will not have vulnerabilities or

358
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,180
divor abilities will be so complicated

359
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,520
that we won't be able to exploit them

360
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,399
but those days are still way way in the

361
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,889
distant future so for now we have these

362
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,770
two sets of problems and whenever we

363
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:17,300
have people problems like phishing or

364
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:20,449
password reused or CEO scams or business

365
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,829
an email compromised attacks whatever

366
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:25,040
that happens whenever it hits the

367
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:28,178
headlines the typical reaction is that

368
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:31,280
oh my god look at these stupid users how

369
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:34,100
idiot do you have to be to fall for

370
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,820
scams like that and I'm sick and tired

371
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:41,540
of user is always getting the blame

372
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,649
because today every modern society

373
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:47,450
expects everybody to be online from

374
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,890
teenage girls to grandmother's everybody

375
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,170
needs to be online because all of our

376
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,320
services are are online and we can't

377
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:57,050
really expect much about the security

378
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,770
awareness level of the average citizen

379
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:03,889
so blaming the user for these problems

380
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:06,139
isn't going to solve anything it's not

381
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,660
stupid users it's stupid

382
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,179
systems and in many ways we should be

383
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,980
taking away the responsibility from the

384
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:15,200
users who can't take the responsibility

385
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,300
to begin with

386
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,790
put the responsibility to where it

387
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,159
belongs and it belongs to operating

388
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,110
system manufacturers to security

389
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,730
companies and also to telcos and

390
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,740
operators which provide the actual

391
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:35,900
connectivity through which the attacks

392
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:39,710
are done so last month I was in Kent in

393
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:43,690
United Kingdom discussing with a CFO of

394
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:46,250
a local real estate company about a

395
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,560
business email compromise that they were

396
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,690
hit with they were hit with a CEO scam

397
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,310
they lost money a typical problem very

398
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,110
you can just you know say that you know

399
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:59,030
how stupid do you have to be to fall for

400
00:18:54,110 --> 00:19:01,159
a Nigerian scam well in this particular

401
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:03,560
case what happened was that the

402
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,960
real-estate company which was it became

403
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,990
the victim was the local company buying

404
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:15,170
and selling real estate and then they

405
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:16,550
agreed to to acquire a local legacy

406
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,130
company which had been around for

407
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,990
decades small company with a couple of

408
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,520
employees because the founder of the

409
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,200
small company weren't wanted to retire

410
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,790
and sell his business is a bigger

411
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,100
company all right

412
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,020
they met face to face they knew each

413
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,240
other they met face to face multiple

414
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,460
times CEOs of both companies were

415
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,760
discussing the details of the deal they

416
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:42,700
agreed to do it they started to write a

417
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:45,290
a legal agreement on the acquiring

418
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,390
details of the company which they were

419
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:50,629
doing over email they were sending a

420
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:53,060
word document back and forth trying to

421
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,680
you know finalize the agreement and

422
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,409
finally when they were both happy and

423
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:01,310
all right we can do this let's let's do

424
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:03,500
it then the bigger company CEO sent an

425
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:06,230
email to the smaller company's CEO

426
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,120
asking for details how we can pay the

427
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:13,400
down payment for you for your company

428
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:15,860
and the old man replied and that email

429
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,140
that one email that was the email which

430
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:21,050
was intercepted by the attackers which

431
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,750
had all along been sitting on the office

432
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:26,060
365 installation of the company watching

433
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,160
all of this happen and doing nothing

434
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,530
just waiting for the right time and then

435
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,960
when the right time appeared someone is

436
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:35,300
asking for an account number they halted

437
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,670
all external email out from the small

438
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,510
company and then started taking over the

439
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:45,170
email communication from their own and

440
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,910
that isn't really a stupid user the CEO

441
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:50,180
of the company which was fooled how

442
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:52,310
could he know like this was a real deal

443
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,560
he actually knew what he was buying he

444
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:58,610
had met the people he was exchanging

445
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,919
emails for weeks if nobody's told him if

446
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:03,979
nobody's educated him about how these

447
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,930
attacks actually work Howard earth would

448
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,100
he have known if somebody would have

449
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,020
told him then of course he would have

450
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,490
made the phone call and confirm the

451
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,260
account number over four or something

452
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,020
but if you don't know you're never gonna

453
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:18,140
do that it's not really a question of

454
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,570
stupid users and it's lazy for us

455
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:26,050
security people to blame the user for

456
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:28,639
problems like this in a similar manner

457
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,680
whenever I'm visiting our customers and

458
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,860
clients one thing I've started doing is

459
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,170
that I asked to be shown around I could

460
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,750
somebody take me around your your office

461
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,220
is here I'd like to see what you do and

462
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,110
most companies are really happy to do

463
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,240
this let's go for a walk let's have a

464
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,949
look around here's our manufacturing

465
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,440
department here's our design department

466
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:51,410
here's our sales here's our top

467
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,780
management and then I asked if we could

468
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:56,210
go to the financial people and then we

469
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,940
go to the CFO's office here's our CFO

470
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:01,370
nice to meet you here's our controller

471
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:04,550
then I asked where are the people who

472
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:07,159
actually pay the bills and there we go

473
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:09,080
and meet the people who pay the bills if

474
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,580
it's a smaller company it's one person

475
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,429
if it's a large enterprise it could be

476
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:16,310
five persons so far every single time

477
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:19,780
the people who pay the bills look like

478
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:22,700
this like really nice middle-aged ladies

479
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,290
can I talk with them that okay so what

480
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,530
do you do well I pay the bills

481
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:29,750
all right how do you pay the bills well

482
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:32,600
I used this online banking system on my

483
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:34,730
computer and she sews shows a desktop

484
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,230
typically running Windows 10 or

485
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,390
something like that and I have this

486
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:40,020
board car to authenticate to the bank

487
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:43,200
system and all that cool

488
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:45,990
right then I asked her that uh how much

489
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,220
money did you move through this computer

490
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:51,540
every month and of course answer stiffer

491
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,120
but it could be like two hundred

492
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,860
thousand euros or half a million dollars

493
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,179
or three million dollars or whatever

494
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:02,760
cool and then I asked my last question

495
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:06,140
the killer question which is could you

496
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,900
now show me the computer that you use

497
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:12,300
for going to Facebook and YouTube and

498
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,580
for googling stuff like where's that and

499
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,470
now they're confused like what do you

500
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,580
mean and you can almost see a light bulb

501
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,780
go on top of their head when they

502
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,000
realize that hmm

503
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,410
I just told this guy that I move half a

504
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,690
million euros through this computer

505
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:27,180
every month why am I going to Facebook

506
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:29,280
with the same computer which is a really

507
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,160
good question and this really isn't

508
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,290
rocket science it's about thinking about

509
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,330
the attacks and the threat surface

510
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:39,000
because that computer that's the prime

511
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,340
computer banking Trojan gangs want to

512
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,160
get their hands on and the more that

513
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:46,020
computer is used for anything else than

514
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,360
just receiving bills and paying the

515
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,240
bills the higher the risk it is that it

516
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,240
will be taken over computers are cheap

517
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,920
you can just have her have another

518
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,530
computer for doing everything else and

519
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:08,120
then one computer only for paying the

520
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:11,100
bills and security needs time to evolve

521
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,500
security and safety both need this I'll

522
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:20,490
show you a photo about what seat belts

523
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:21,360
used to look like it's the right idea it

524
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,550
is a good idea

525
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,189
it just needs still a little bit

526
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:29,010
evolvement and the same thing applies to

527
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:30,990
security when you look at any of the

528
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,600
things we've innovated over the last

529
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:36,060
decades none of it was ready when it was

530
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,730
innovated it needs time out there in the

531
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:41,909
field needs real users to use them for

532
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:45,240
real to see what works and what doesn't

533
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:49,860
and sometimes it feels like we're doing

534
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:52,950
no progress at all we kept keep hearing

535
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:55,679
about companies getting hacked and mad

536
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:58,530
Sibley large data breaches over and over

537
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,150
again and when you look at that it's

538
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:03,389
easy to forget that we actually are

539
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:06,470
making progress just look where we were

540
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:10,320
10 years ago and look where we are today

541
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:12,090
the systems we use today are so much

542
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,909
better than what they used to be

543
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:17,429
we are getting better the attackers of

544
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:18,710
course are trying to catch up but ten

545
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,940
years ago

546
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,770
look at the computers we were running

547
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,750
Windows XP was still number one

548
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,540
operating system 10 years ago and by the

549
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:30,180
way Windows XP did not have a firewall

550
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:32,220
by default XP service pack 0 didn't have

551
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,140
a firewall like you plug that although

552
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,350
the internet every port was open that's

553
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:40,590
how bad it was over the last 10 years

554
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:42,990
new modern mobile systems have taken

555
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:46,110
over the world Android and iOS

556
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:48,030
they of course still have problems but

557
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:50,310
overall when you look at the safety and

558
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:53,389
security level of the devices we have in

559
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:55,980
our pockets these are really really well

560
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:58,140
secure to compare to anything we used to

561
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,200
have before and they are superior to our

562
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,240
computers our mobile phones are superior

563
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,510
in their security model to our computers

564
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,640
for the basic reason that you can't just

565
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,290
simply write code on it and give that

566
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,920
code to anyone else you have to go

567
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:14,790
through the app store model and

568
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:21,680
verification will know before it's

569
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:24,180
actually globally available so we are

570
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,660
making progress it doesn't always feel

571
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:29,640
like that and it's especially hard to

572
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:34,700
feel like we're making progress when you

573
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:36,930
look at the the best attackers out there

574
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,080
especially when you look at governments

575
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:43,770
and the kind of work they do governments

576
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:47,340
have the biggest budget and they are the

577
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:49,850
most persistent attacker the problem

578
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,810
with governmental attacks isn't really

579
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,689
about anything else

580
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:57,570
as about persistence sometimes we use

581
00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:00,240
the word apt to describe governmental

582
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:02,740
attacks and they're the abbreviation

583
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:07,179
advanced persistent threat the

584
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:09,370
really is the P persistent if you have a

585
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:12,390
persistent attacker an attacker who

586
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:15,820
won't give up then you have a problem

587
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:18,790
because normal attackers give up normal

588
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:21,820
attackers are not after you normal

589
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:25,840
attackers are after money and if it's

590
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:29,139
too hard to slow too expensive to hack

591
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,330
you they will forget about you they will

592
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,760
go after an easier target they will go

593
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:37,178
after the low-hanging fruit and believe

594
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,879
me when I tell you that the Internet is

595
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:43,120
a garden of low-hanging fruits there's

596
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,550
like so many easier targets than you if

597
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,070
you do any basic work to securing your

598
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:51,280
networks so it's really easy to avoid

599
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,659
criminal attackers compared the

600
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,250
governmental attackers because

601
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,800
governmental attackers don't change

602
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,540
their mind they don't give up the reason

603
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,200
why they don't change their mind is that

604
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:05,409
these guys typically work for a military

605
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,870
organization and what people inside

606
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:10,510
military organizations do is that they

607
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:14,770
follow orders so these guys have been

608
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:18,520
given an order you you and you go and

609
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:21,400
hack that company in that country steal

610
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:26,290
this information report back when you've

611
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:28,120
done it go that kind of an order and if

612
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:30,370
that's the framework you're working in

613
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,590
that's what you're gonna do you're gonna

614
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:35,139
hack that company and if you can't get

615
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:37,000
it if it's too slow too expensive too

616
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,070
hard to get in you're not going to

617
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,600
change your mind

618
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:42,399
not gonna change your mind we can't get

619
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,230
into this company never mind let's hack

620
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,170
someone else you're not going to do that

621
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:49,960
you're gonna keep trying until you get

622
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:51,760
in you will try different tactics

623
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,650
different techniques you bring in more

624
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,480
people you bring in more resources if

625
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,610
you can't figure out any other way then

626
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,280
you finally get one of your own guys or

627
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,419
girls recruited as an employee of the

628
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,000
company to gain access to the

629
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:06,460
information if the attacker doesn't give

630
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,500
up and has unlimited or basically

631
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,960
unlimited time eventually they will get

632
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:14,290
in and that's why finding governmental

633
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,409
attackers are so hard and that's why you

634
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:21,158
shouldn't even try

635
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:23,200
you shouldn't rely or that anything you

636
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,900
do would keep them outside of your

637
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,279
network instead you should focus on

638
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:32,169
being able to detect when they get in

639
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,750
now I'm not saying we shouldn't have

640
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:36,220
firewalls or gateways or proxies or any

641
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,620
of that of course we should it makes our

642
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,720
job easier but we shouldn't rely that

643
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,059
they will keep everybody out there is an

644
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,429
unlimited amount of attacks we can only

645
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:47,918
imagine a limited amount of those

646
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:49,990
attacks and if we only put our effort in

647
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,669
the building walls around our systems

648
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,820
then we are not going to be looking

649
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:57,309
inside of our systems for signs of a

650
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,460
bridge so we could detect when we have a

651
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:03,639
bridge so we could react when there is a

652
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:06,909
bridge and this is what we see very

653
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,880
clearly inside our Incident Response

654
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:11,860
Teams the teams inside of our company

655
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,779
which are called when a company is

656
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,418
hacked because it almost always they

657
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:18,070
company which calls us assumes they've

658
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:19,299
just been hacked and then we have to

659
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,000
tell them that they were hacked last

660
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:24,580
year or two years ago or three years ago

661
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,020
they just didn't realize because they

662
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,529
weren't looking because they were

663
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:36,039
assuming that whatever solutions they've

664
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:37,419
bought will keep everybody out and as we

665
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:39,549
start speaking about governmental

666
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:41,880
attackers it's always two countries

667
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:47,500
which make the headlines

668
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:51,130
China and Russia Russia and China why

669
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,990
these two well it's not because other

670
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,730
countries would not be attacking because

671
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,279
other countries are attacking including

672
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,500
like similar civilized Western

673
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,909
democracies like United Kingdom and

674
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:05,850
United States there are victims of

675
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:08,559
Western intelligence agencies hacking

676
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:11,889
within a hundred mile radius from where

677
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:14,350
we are right now however Western

678
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:17,799
intelligence agencies really really

679
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:20,289
really don't want to get caught Russians

680
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:22,059
and Chinese don't really care that's

681
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:24,429
where the difference really is that's

682
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:27,250
why we keep seeing much more of the

683
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:28,990
cases coming from Russia and China most

684
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,530
of the cases which we know of coming

685
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,860
from

686
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:34,270
certain intelligence agencies have been

687
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,340
have became public knowledge because of

688
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,520
a whistleblower or then something

689
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:44,980
extraordinary like Stuxnet which became

690
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:48,100
public because of complicated issues but

691
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,870
Russia and China are both massively

692
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,480
large countries Russia is the biggest

693
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:54,189
country on the planet China has more

694
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,230
people than any other country on the

695
00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:00,250
planet both countries are filled with

696
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:04,630
great minds great coders great engineers

697
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:07,510
great physicists great of everything so

698
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:11,760
with that in mind it's quite surprising

699
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:17,620
how different these countries are in

700
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:21,300
exporting their technology we all have

701
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:23,889
Chinese chips in our pockets right now

702
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:26,379
everybody in the room has something made

703
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:29,230
in China in their pocket none of you

704
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:32,380
have anything made in China in your

705
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:35,410
pockets unless somebody's carrying a

706
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:38,920
Kalashnikov and if you're carrying a

707
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:42,010
Kalashnikov don't tell me and isn't this

708
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,930
a little bit surprising but what a big

709
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:46,960
difference between these two countries

710
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:48,760
and of course this then means that

711
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,280
during times of conflict and during

712
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,200
times of crisis China has a completely

713
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,080
different visibility on to the rest of

714
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,270
the world which is partially the

715
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,310
explanation why we are in the middle of

716
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:02,860
a trade war between United States and

717
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:06,010
China right now especially with the talk

718
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:08,889
around Huawei and ZTE there's no

719
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:10,450
evidence that any of these massive large

720
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,070
Chinese tech companies would be

721
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,290
cooperating directly with the Chinese

722
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:17,139
government to spy on the rest of the

723
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:18,700
world it it's possible I mean

724
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,400
technically doable that's what's

725
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:24,100
worrying about it these companies have

726
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,320
been called for spying when you speak

727
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:28,510
about industrial espionage for example

728
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,370
one way has been spying on other

729
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,960
companies to steal technology which they

730
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:34,870
use in their own products that's

731
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,090
completely different for working as a

732
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:40,989
tool for your government to spy on the

733
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:43,270
rest of the world nevertheless it's

734
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:48,070
quite clear that we are now

735
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:51,730
in an arms race cyber arms race if you

736
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:53,678
will the word cyber is complicated as

737
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,210
you know many of here still remember the

738
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,790
time when someone used the word cyber

739
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:59,980
what they meant was cyber sex nowadays

740
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:02,050
when generals talked about doing cyber

741
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:08,969
they don't mean cyber sex they means

742
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:11,710
something else and cyber weapons work

743
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:15,428
cyber weapons get the job done

744
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:19,869
cyber weapons are affordable effective

745
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:21,790
and deniable effective affordable

746
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:23,560
deniable that's a pretty good weapon

747
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,779
when the weapon gets the job done

748
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,480
it's cheaper than alternatives and you

749
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:33,760
can deny that it wasn't your weapon to

750
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,679
begin with so when we speak about

751
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:41,350
computer attacks are we speaking about

752
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:43,960
actual of war first-ever review of

753
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:46,118
international cyberattacks that computer

754
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,629
sabotage emanating from another country

755
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:52,530
can constitute an act of war computer

756
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:55,899
attack emanating from another country

757
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:58,050
constitutes an act of war this is the

758
00:34:55,899 --> 00:35:02,140
newest clip from 15 years ago already

759
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:03,520
the question whether cyber attacks are

760
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:06,400
actually something you can retaliate

761
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,380
with traditional weapons is a very good

762
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,420
question because we have this small

763
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:13,180
problem called attribution in the middle

764
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:16,240
how do you actually know who attacked

765
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:19,270
you if the attack isn't about and b-52

766
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:23,200
flying over your head dropping bombs but

767
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:26,650
about something more virtual well

768
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:30,339
sometimes it can be done we all remember

769
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:32,850
the example from May this year as

770
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:35,800
Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson

771
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:39,009
announced that they had launched a

772
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,950
kinetic attack with missiles to

773
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:47,109
retaliate against a cyber attack unit of

774
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:47,618
Hamas and this is as real world as it

775
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:51,400
gets

776
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:54,750
but here attribution maybe is easier to

777
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,650
do than in most other cases because here

778
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,599
Israel Defense Forces

779
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,640
been doing similar attacks before to

780
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,579
target for example the propaganda units

781
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,259
of Hamas again basically office workers

782
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:08,650
who are not shooting anybody but are

783
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:11,079
doing work to support the effort if

784
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:13,000
that's a valid target then I guess cyber

785
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,950
is a valid target as well and in this

786
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,990
case I guess they had good enough

787
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:23,189
intelligence to believe that they are

788
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:27,509
bombing the right building but as cyber

789
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:31,329
war is this word that is being used to

790
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:33,700
describe attacks like this it's good to

791
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:36,670
know that I I don't really think we will

792
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:39,700
ever see a cyber war between two

793
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:41,289
countries I don't believe that we will

794
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,640
ever see a war where two countries are

795
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:45,720
just attacking each others online

796
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:48,520
because cyber is just a domain and

797
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:51,299
technology has always shaped the

798
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,349
conflicts we fight with each other

799
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:56,020
hundreds of years ago we the only

800
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:58,359
technology we had were short so only all

801
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,520
wars we had where land Wars until we got

802
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:03,819
good enough technology to build warships

803
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:07,200
an innovation of warships which created

804
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:11,038
sea war didn't make land war disappear

805
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,200
conflict just expanded from land to sea

806
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:17,140
then technology shaped conflict again we

807
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:20,890
got air war then we got satellites and

808
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:26,470
 so space war and now today cyber

809
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:28,960
space war but you know what these five

810
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:32,069
domains for war we have today are not

811
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,990
gonna be the only ones there will be

812
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:38,288
future domains new domains for war

813
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:42,520
domains for war that we can't imagine

814
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:45,309
today or if we try to imagine what they

815
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,980
might be it's gonna be really some

816
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:49,210
really science fiction like because you

817
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:56,559
know we might be speaking about things

818
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:58,990
like DNA warfare or nano warfare what

819
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:02,289
could nano warfare look like in distant

820
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:05,470
future well you can imagine enemy planes

821
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:08,740
flying over your land dropping nanobots

822
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:10,459
which would then be airborne and enter

823
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,680
the bloodstream of your soul

824
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,410
go to their brains to change their

825
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,240
thoughts and if that sounds like science

826
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:20,450
fiction to you exactly

827
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:23,810
just like cyberwar sounded like science

828
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:27,470
fiction 30 years ago so there will be

829
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:30,770
new domains for conflict new domains for

830
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:32,598
war and as we speak about machine

831
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:35,859
learning and artificial intelligence I

832
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:38,720
actually believe that this development

833
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:42,049
is going to increase the likelihood of

834
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,330
conflict not decrease but increase the

835
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:46,640
likelihood of conflicts

836
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:50,348
just imagine even if you don't believe

837
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,790
in strong why'd AI just for a moment

838
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:55,130
imagine that a company or a country

839
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:59,779
would announce that they are on the

840
00:38:55,130 --> 00:39:01,700
verge of massive new development and

841
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:05,500
they believe they will have superhuman

842
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:09,680
intelligence in their hands next month

843
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:11,810
how would other countries react other

844
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,720
countries would see that and they would

845
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:18,230
immediately realize that whole hell if

846
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,470
those guys get that capability it's

847
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:24,880
going to be game over they will win

848
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:27,529
everything they will be superior in

849
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,940
everything they will beat us in any

850
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:34,250
competition they will win every war so

851
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:37,460
no matter what no matter what's the cost

852
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:39,890
we must steal that technology and if

853
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:46,160
they can't steal that technology we must

854
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:49,879
destroy that technology so it's gonna be

855
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:53,930
a really interesting development if we

856
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,060
ever will see something which would

857
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:58,368
start to resemble human intelligence and

858
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,170
if we will see that I do believe it's

859
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:01,580
gonna come from brain simulators there's

860
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:04,010
multiple projects underway already

861
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,720
trying to simulate the whole human brain

862
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:08,240
which is very hard to do and we're not

863
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,250
even close but it's easy to see that if

864
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,049
we're able to simulate a whole human

865
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:14,540
brain obviously that thing is

866
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:17,180
intelligent just like we are it just

867
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:19,310
doesn't have a body and then if you

868
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,319
scale it up and it's like 10 billion

869
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:24,069
times faster than a real human brain

870
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:29,410
then it would be superhuman intelligent

871
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:31,640
is that gonna happen maybe I don't know

872
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:35,750
artificial intelligence is shaping our

873
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:38,990
world all to develop and the round deep

874
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:43,339
fix is gonna have effect on our world

875
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:47,689
however I think we all saw the news this

876
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:50,269
month about the first CEO scan attack

877
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:51,650
done with I have to post this because I

878
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:55,729
know you can't listen to me when you're

879
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:58,190
watching this it's impossible we all

880
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:01,700
heard the news about deep fake voice

881
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:04,160
used in a sea of scam this month we're a

882
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,348
company I believe in Germany was spoofed

883
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,490
because someone called them and they had

884
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:13,220
a deep fake voice resembling their CEO I

885
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:16,399
don't believe that I'm calling

886
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:18,980
on that one not because it couldn't be

887
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,809
doable it is doable it's probably doable

888
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,029
already today I just think it's not

889
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:24,680
likely that that's the way it was done I

890
00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:26,799
think it's more likely that they just

891
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,328
had a guy who sounded like the sea

892
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:32,259
instead of having some real-time deep

893
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:34,849
fake voice generator which would do that

894
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:37,460
or maybe it wasn't even that maybe it's

895
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:39,109
just a good cover story so like what we

896
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,480
spoke earlier about blaming the user

897
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:44,299
like how stupid do you have to be to

898
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,579
fall for a CEO scam well imagine if you

899
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:49,369
are the one who was fooled it's a pretty

900
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:52,039
good story and you know I'm not stupid I

901
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:53,359
was fooled by a completely new kind of

902
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:55,099
an attack which we've never seen before

903
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,910
which would fool anybody but it was a

904
00:41:55,099 --> 00:42:00,259
deep fake now we don't really know we do

905
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,348
because we don't have the recording of

906
00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:05,869
the call but I don't I'm not gonna buy

907
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:09,349
that deep fakes have really been used in

908
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:11,480
real attacks unless I see proof but it

909
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:13,309
will be done in the future and

910
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,829
artificial intelligence will be used in

911
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:19,779
attacks in the future and if you don't

912
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:22,630
believe me maybe you believe this guy

913
00:42:19,779 --> 00:42:25,549
who do you see Needham per se Edition

914
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:28,990
simulation is this palace and it was

915
00:42:25,549 --> 00:42:31,479
noiseless T II through the pregnancy

916
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:37,488
schedule gross

917
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:41,209
total insanity I'm going to see a molded

918
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:45,410
listing in amiran dot literally this

919
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:47,749
theory standard Lehrer Mira who leads

920
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:52,640
artificial intelligence will rule the

921
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:53,209
world so machine learning is part of the

922
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,598
puzzle

923
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:59,930
and today all security companies are

924
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:01,309
using machine learning for defense in

925
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,319
the near future is going to be used for

926
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:05,959
orphans as well we haven't actually seen

927
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:09,650
that yet we've only seen attackers

928
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:12,288
trying to poison our systems that use

929
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:13,789
machine learning for defense but we

930
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:20,749
actually haven't seen attackers used

931
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:22,609
machine learning as real attacks so

932
00:43:20,749 --> 00:43:26,649
we've got to stop relying on just

933
00:43:22,609 --> 00:43:30,469
building the walls around our networks

934
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:32,359
gotta put more and more effort into just

935
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:36,650
accepting that whatever walls we build

936
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:38,239
they won't keep everybody out and if

937
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:40,640
somebody gets in we have to be able to

938
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:44,029
detect that there's a bridge so we can

939
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:49,549
react when there is a breach and when

940
00:43:44,029 --> 00:43:50,959
security works is invisible tomorrow in

941
00:43:49,549 --> 00:43:53,239
the biggest newspaper here in the

942
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:55,819
Netherlands you will not see a headline

943
00:43:53,239 --> 00:44:00,440
which says that the second largest Dutch

944
00:43:55,819 --> 00:44:02,569
company was not hacked yesterday but

945
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,699
that's not gonna be news if it is hacked

946
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:07,190
then that will be news and that means

947
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:11,329
that we have to keep succeeding in our

948
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:14,359
work every time and when we do that it's

949
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:17,359
invisible nobody sees if we fail then

950
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:19,759
it's gonna be very visible and rarely is

951
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:23,709
anyone thanked for the work they did to

952
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:26,839
prevent the disaster that didn't happen

953
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:29,749
rarely is anyone thanked for the work

954
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:35,269
they did to prevent the disaster that

955
00:44:29,749 --> 00:44:36,709
didn't happen so I want to thank you for

956
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:40,879
the work that you are doing to prevent

957
00:44:36,709 --> 00:44:44,019
the disaster thank you for your work

958
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,019
thank you very much

959
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,290
thank you so much because I can search

960
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,570
he has run through kitchens flight there

961
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:00,279
is no B but we hope they often one grew

962
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,500
berg so unfortunately no time for

963
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,350
questions thank you to fit into tight

964
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:09,000
schedule thank you for you all again a

965
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:09,000
moment of thank you
