34
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,780
Australian I am from a suburb called

35
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,750
cherry Brook who here has been to Terry

36
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,009
Brooke nobody of course nobody has been

37
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,880
to cherrybrook cherrybrook is a very

38
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:48,469
tiny suburb in the northwest of Sydney I

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,259
spent the first 15 years of my life

40
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:53,030
there how many convinced that nothing of

41
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:54,909
any consequence would ever happen to me

42
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,140
okay so that's Terry Brooke for you

43
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:58,760
gives you a lot of time to imagine

44
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,470
things okay

45
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:06,200
to basically work a curious mind I left

46
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,150
home at 18 I traveled the world I ended

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,410
up in France about eight years ago and

48
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,020
I've been working for screen for about a

49
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,000
year and a half so what is screen screen

50
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,520
is security without the hassle okay we

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,110
do application security management ok

52
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,120
app sick I don't think I need to go much

53
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,650
further given where we are if you're

54
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,260
curious about it however feel free to

55
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:28,850
ask me have a look on the internet

56
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:30,859
afterwards so why is the HR person

57
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,950
talking at a security conference any

58
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,240
ideas

59
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,070
because it's important this is it I like

60
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,420
this I like there's last-minute addition

61
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,489
with the right answers this is what we

62
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:45,950
like to see ok this is important HR is

63
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:49,900
important ok yeah why else ok people are

64
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:54,230
what ok ok absolutely the key part yeah

65
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,450
why else ok to enforce did use the word

66
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,549
enforce I will come back to that I like

67
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:01,010
it yeah in front that's that's why I got

68
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,500
into this gig to enforce things perfect

69
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,149
yeah also maybe just not enough speaker

70
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,160
applications this year right little bit

71
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,340
thin on the grounds or pen testers yeah

72
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,829
something like that something like that

73
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,630
so I wasn't sort of born to be an HR

74
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,489
person right I didn't so those you know

75
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,620
run out of high school saying you know

76
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:21,230
let me at those hills tennis homes and

77
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,340
payroll and you know hiring people all

78
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,440
the time that's going to be exciting

79
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,870
actually don't have a passion for HR as

80
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,310
such my friends and colleagues often say

81
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,750
to me hey house and well you're the head

82
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,500
of people you must really love people

83
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:37,100
right wrong I actually don't like people

84
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:40,040
very much at all but I am fascinated by

85
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,250
them ok what keeps me in my job is

86
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,470
trying to understand all of the small

87
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,090
tiny intricate combination of things

88
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,450
that motivate people to do the things

89
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,700
they do and they do a lot of things

90
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,880
right you've seen some things I imagine

91
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,320
the people have done right yeah why

92
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,329
whether that's to do with consequences

93
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,799
or the judgment of others coming in or

94
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,140
whether they do things for personal gain

95
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,220
or a moral obligation my life's work is

96
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,109
basically to understand why and

97
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,859
therefore to help predict and maybe

98
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,660
shape some of those behaviors for a very

99
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,840
young age I've been observing power

100
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,750
structures around me and trying to find

101
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,430
out where the boundaries are I mentioned

102
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,060
I grew up in chery chery Brook is a very

103
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,970
small suburb outside of Sydney and in

104
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,790
1989 my sister and I with my parents

105
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,110
moved into a house in a streets that was

106
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,060
just dirt okay

107
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,240
Australia compared to European countries

108
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,310
we went from dirt to bitumen we didn't

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,750
go through the cobblestones okay can

110
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,850
imagine my shock when I arrived in

111
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,180
Europe sort of eight years ago what are

112
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:47,580
these things okay so basically we let my

113
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,140
sister and I you grew up in this fairly

114
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,060
quiet street you were more likely to

115
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,120
cross a horse coming in without a rider

116
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,260
than you were to cross a car so my

117
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,820
sister and I were allowed to ride our

118
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,270
bikes out the front of our house while

119
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,190
mum was inside doing something else but

120
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,590
we had lines on our driveway three

121
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,690
segments Pebble Creek the second line

122
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,190
was the limit okay we're allowed to ride

123
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,640
our bikes as much as we liked as long as

124
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,719
we didn't go across that second line now

125
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,169
there are lots of different types of

126
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,900
people in this world my sister is a rule

127
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:20,789
follower okay succeeds very well in

128
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,060
traditional environments okay excellent

129
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:26,160
at academics does the right thing okay

130
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,180
very important to her that she does the

131
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,040
right thing so if the line was here my

132
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,720
sister would say I could have me two

133
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,310
back from it to make sure she didn't

134
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,870
accidentally touch the line with a bike

135
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:41,550
tyre me on the other hand at the age of

136
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,560
two I was always fairly convinced that

137
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,020
this line might have been a concert not

138
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,290
actually a boundary and so I would ride

139
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,229
my bike tricycle at the time up to it

140
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:54,990
and just kiss the line with my bike tire

141
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,580
and then I would wait I noticed that

142
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,560
nothing actually happened and so the

143
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,250
next time I would go just a centimetre

144
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,710
over the line same thing the earth went

145
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,990
on turning and so apparently I abandoned

146
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,280
this inch-by-inch iteration and one day

147
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,440
just abandoned the tricycle and went and

148
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,419
sat in the middle of the road my sister

149
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,610
ran inside to see my mom is hidden yeah

150
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,438
mommy mommy Ali's in the road

151
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,030
so quite reasonably - my older sister

152
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,500
why didn't you get her out for my sister

153
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:26,068
said well because I'm not allowed to

154
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:28,590
pass that line I was punished it was the

155
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:30,900
late 80s I was smacked which I

156
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:34,710
rightfully deserved sent to my room and

157
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:37,318
told that it was okay we didn't have to

158
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:40,500
tell my dad my sister had also been

159
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,729
breached bribed and told that I'd been

160
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,789
punished and we didn't have to tell my

161
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:48,150
dad dad gets home from his day of work

162
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:49,620
at the bank I started to understand

163
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:53,068
something I've understood that actually

164
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,229
maybe I'm not the one who risks to be in

165
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:56,009
the most trouble here but something else

166
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:57,529
is at play

167
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:00,330
so when dad walks in the door I

168
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:02,669
triumphantly scream from the top level

169
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:05,340
of our of our house I've been on the

170
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:08,188
road today daddy what Institute was a

171
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,810
fairly loud discussion between my

172
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:11,909
parents and from that day on I kind of

173
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,349
understood that maybe you know there are

174
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:15,020
different things that play than just the

175
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:20,490
rules that parents give their children

176
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:22,799
so so I got into HR basically if you

177
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,680
here already works closely like day to

178
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,990
day with their hate our team anyone okay

179
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,259
excellent on something other than

180
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,370
recruitment yeah okay excellent

181
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:36,089
what are you working with your HR teams

182
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,349
on security awareness excellent all

183
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:42,779
right you're gonna be able to teach us

184
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:45,650
some things I think okay okay great old

185
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:47,969
structures onboarding yeah what else

186
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,438
email attachment analysis so that's hey

187
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:51,569
char saying hey we got a thing can you

188
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,520
check it out yeah absolutely that's a

189
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:56,339
good good point okay perfect

190
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,389
I think things basically so actually

191
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,289
most of you didn't raise your hands

192
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:02,460
right do you know who your HR teams are

193
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:03,960
yeah do you know how to find them right

194
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,938
you're working security light you can

195
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,198
find anyone yeah okay perfect if you had

196
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:08,969
to write you could track them down

197
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,680
perfect by the end of the talk I hope

198
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:13,349
I've convinced you to go and like have a

199
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,120
conversation with them for me I think

200
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:16,740
there are three reasons why security and

201
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,879
HR teams can learn from each other and

202
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,250
probably should work more closely

203
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,509
together the first one is because we're

204
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,320
basically doing the same job

205
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:25,790
okay hear me out

206
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,260
HR and software engineering and HR and

207
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,270
security actually isn't all that

208
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,280
different

209
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:33,590
my main job today is to design systems

210
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,140
and processes and architect

211
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:39,140
organizations hoping for predictable

212
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,549
repeatable results that can scale ok not

213
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,289
unlike the job of a software engineer

214
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:44,030
except when your architecture

215
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,849
architecting backends of applications

216
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,740
you usually don't have to keep in mind

217
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,900
the hidden agendas of your AWS machines

218
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,870
for example ok when you're architecting

219
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,640
for people totally different ballgame

220
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,750
ok Everett youyou can predict about 10

221
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,360
percent of what people will do in a

222
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,370
system which is fun one of the things

223
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,170
that makes HR people really successful

224
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,380
is their ability to see around corners

225
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:09,110
to predict edge cases to anticipate and

226
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,000
mitigate risks and always always prepare

227
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:14,510
for the worst-case scenario

228
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,710
ok if that sounds familiar basically it

229
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,720
makes us good at our jobs and really

230
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:20,000
average to talk to our parties anything

231
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,410
more is just soar the same yet that DJ

232
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,660
plays that next so things are going

233
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,800
really terribly I'm out of here

234
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,600
the second reason I think that you

235
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,540
should speak to your HR team regularly

236
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,100
if you work in security is as you

237
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,099
mentioned security it's a people problem

238
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,410
right ok and hey char understands people

239
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,350
the weakest link in any system the human

240
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:43,699
factor who here has a good definition

241
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:45,290
for social engineering who has a

242
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,090
definition for social engineering let's

243
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,089
not set the bar too high it's early yeah

244
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,580
[Music]

245
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,500
ok all right I like it manipulating

246
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,820
people to do things potentially things

247
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,670
that are illegal or things that are not

248
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:10,910
allowed absolutely a nice definition I

249
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,439
like for social engineering is the at or

250
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,050
better yet the science it's still

251
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,230
skillfully maneuvering human beings to

252
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:20,479
take action in some area of their life

253
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,950
this is literally my job description ok

254
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,910
the next time I'm hiring for my team I'm

255
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,890
just literally going to put that

256
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,010
sentence and say who does this ok who's

257
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:30,590
good at this I spend my days convincing

258
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,430
candidates that actually working for a

259
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:35,490
series a startup in

260
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,439
is much better than working for any

261
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:41,510
other company anywhere in the world okay

262
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,650
I convinced my managers that maybe

263
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,390
changing the way they want to

264
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,550
communicate for a way that would be

265
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:51,060
effective to communicate is a great idea

266
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:53,130
I sometimes plant seeds of ideas in

267
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,810
leaders heads so that a couple of months

268
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,730
later when they come out with a great

269
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,380
new initiative it is the thing that we

270
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,720
should do another thing they maybe first

271
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,040
wanted to do and then I try and

272
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,860
understand how people in the team

273
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,620
respond to praise versus feedback versus

274
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,390
reward the skills required to be

275
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,800
effective in HR are very similar to the

276
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,390
skills required to be an effective

277
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,920
social engineer what's the difference

278
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:19,770
between HR and social engineers

279
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:21,750
oh nice the intention yeah that's a very

280
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,250
that's a very diplomatic way to put it

281
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:27,000
absolutely what I've written on my slide

282
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:30,840
here is one uses that power for good but

283
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,730
I won't tell you which okay nice we know

284
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,360
that social engineering by its very

285
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:39,030
nature encourages users to step outside

286
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,590
of a normal process or procedure okay so

287
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,850
it's not that we didn't have a process

288
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,580
or procedure it's that we manage to

289
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,950
circumvent it in listing hey try to help

290
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,170
you understand and predict specifically

291
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,720
what might motivate person a or person B

292
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:55,170
to deviate from that system can be

293
00:11:51,720 --> 00:12:00,060
helpful does some of you may be familiar

294
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:02,219
with the phishing attack where basically

295
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,589
a woman calls up trying to change the

296
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,360
password on her husband's mobile phone

297
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,770
account and place crying sounds of

298
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,450
babies in the background okay

299
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,280
so understanding who would be

300
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:13,140
susceptible but which sort of

301
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,860
manipulation is something that HR is

302
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,569
pretty good at we will for example in my

303
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,980
daily life if I need to have a difficult

304
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,650
conversation with one of the engineers

305
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,840
and there is myself our director of

306
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,760
engineering our CTO and co-founder

307
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,770
available to do that conversation what

308
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,060
will choose who takes that conversation

309
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,030
will depend on the person in front of us

310
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,229
if it's somebody who needs to feel like

311
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,880
they're very very valued by the

312
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,050
organization in order to hear the hard

313
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,180
feedback will send the CTO and

314
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,010
co-founder if it's someone who needs to

315
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,780
feel like we're sort of all in this

316
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,870
together and they've got allies in this

317
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,350
and we might send me

318
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,670
okay because I'm a little bit less

319
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,980
organizational a little bit less top

320
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,779
leadership to talk in there so figuring

321
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,600
out who will respond best to what and

322
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:56,980
also what the risks are also in

323
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,529
interviews there are certain members of

324
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,960
the team who I wouldn't necessarily put

325
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,880
an interview alone with a candidate okay

326
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,200
because of the messages they give up

327
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:09,130
because of what their are susceptible

328
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,839
their influence and somebody the back

329
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,980
you mentioned that HR comes to you often

330
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,279
to check their email attachments

331
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,800
absolutely some uses by design of their

332
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,980
job role are just inherently more likely

333
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,290
to be exposed to certain attacks okay so

334
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,240
our job of HR and recruitment basically

335
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,680
is to receive emails and LinkedIn

336
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,390
messages from people we don't know with

337
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,859
attachments okay that are usually PDFs

338
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,810
and it's usually in our best interest to

339
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,270
open them okay so that's something

340
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,489
similarly finance teams so your support

341
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,839
teams you might traditionally think have

342
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,550
the least security knowledge and they're

343
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,790
the most at risk okay so it's important

344
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:45,040
to be having those conversations the

345
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,890
third reason I take HR and security

346
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,150
teams should work together is that HR

347
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:52,000
spends a lot of time trying to design

348
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:54,880
human systems that won't provoke

349
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,510
unwanted behavior so a few illustrations

350
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,620
here

351
00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:02,920
does anyone fear use take the eyes yeah

352
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:05,950
knows what a KPI is okay okay Oz yeah

353
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,449
okay any other afternoon for trendy

354
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:12,910
things that came out of Google yeah okay

355
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,779
the idea behind KPIs or okay does

356
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,550
everyone know what I'm talking about

357
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:18,040
when I say it okay so like gold like

358
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,810
SMART goals if you will if we're still

359
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,510
in the early 2000s okay so basically a

360
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:24,219
way of designing objectives that we can

361
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:28,959
quantify and easily measure success

362
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:33,940
against it's not a bad idea in theory do

363
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:36,609
they work well in practice yeah yeah

364
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,050
yeah I mean it depends is about the most

365
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,000
positive answer you can get right when

366
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,650
you asked about our chaos and KPIs right

367
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,560
is it a good system if the answer is

368
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:46,839
always it depends probably not right so

369
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,339
does anybody know much about the

370
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:53,910
Australian Ambulance Association say are

371
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:56,230
there any other Australians in the room

372
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:58,069
all right that's fine totally fine

373
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,730
nobody's worried all right great

374
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:03,259
so the Australian Ambulance Association

375
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:07,269
what do you think the main job is why do

376
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:07,269
they exist what's the reason for being

377
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:16,279
yep so the basis they control all the

378
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,699
ambulances in Australia sorry trick

379
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:22,040
question

380
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:23,750
they're there to save lives hmm so no

381
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,339
the lobbyist group correct indeed they

382
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,829
are actually just doing the works yep

383
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:29,000
probably probably also you know a little

384
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:30,920
bit political but they're doing the work

385
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,649
so the Australian Ambulance Association

386
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,810
basically their one goal their reason

387
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:38,810
for being is you're basically to make it

388
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:40,609
so that less people die they decided to

389
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,839
borrow from the private sector and they

390
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,310
wanted to look at basically some

391
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,160
efficiency measures that they could put

392
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,920
in place they basically tracks their

393
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,310
stats and they noticed that when they

394
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,930
attended to an emergency call within

395
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,729
nine minutes that the outcomes were

396
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,859
drastically better okay outcomes in this

397
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,000
case meaning less people died okay we're

398
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,199
not talking about bottom line revenue

399
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,220
and I was talking about bugs in an

400
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:03,319
application if they were talking about

401
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,190
less people died better outcomes if you

402
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:09,829
respond to a call in under nine minutes

403
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:11,870
so they thought it would be better if we

404
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:13,489
respond to more calls in under nine

405
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,540
minutes okay and one of the ways they

406
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,430
thought it would do that was to

407
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,389
explicitly say that okay we can't

408
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,579
improve something that we haven't

409
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:20,990
changed towards so okay let's say well

410
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,060
the ambulance drivers that they are to

411
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,069
respond to calls from the moment it hits

412
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:28,579
them from dispatch in under nine minutes

413
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:29,930
okay in order to incentivize this they

414
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,430
said that basically the teams the

415
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,959
ambulance teams who respond to the most

416
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,779
calls in under nine minutes who have the

417
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,449
best stats on their KPIs get to choose

418
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:39,850
which shifts they work okay and will

419
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:41,959
it's working as you can imagine

420
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,810
accidents never stopped so they work

421
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,369
around the clock weekends nights okay

422
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,729
and basically it's very attractive to be

423
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:51,620
able to choose when you work after a

424
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:55,040
month of this system they measured the

425
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,720
results and they saw and that they had

426
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,310
indeed increased the number of accidents

427
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,750
that they attended to in under nine

428
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,469
minutes which was excellent that was the

429
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:07,040
goal they also noticed a spike around 18

430
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:09,770
minutes and around 27 minutes which they

431
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,490
previously never had before

432
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,569
and an overall spike in the death toll

433
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,240
now trying to figure out what was going

434
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:21,770
on does anyone have an idea of what

435
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,930
might have been happening there okay

436
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,730
yeah absolutely so they were focusing on

437
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,800
individual goals which is my truck

438
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,320
receives the call I have nine minutes to

439
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,940
respond ambulance drivers were arriving

440
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,439
close to the scene of an accident and

441
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,270
seeing on the clocks that they would

442
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,490
arrive at nine minutes and ten seconds

443
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,930
for example so they were rejecting the

444
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,370
call sending it back to dispatch sment

445
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,930
was going back out to another truck who

446
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:48,050
then had nine minutes back on the clock

447
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:49,970
who would do the same thing and so on it

448
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,649
sounded like a good idea right it

449
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,450
sounded like a good idea but because of

450
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,460
the human factor and because of the

451
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,830
motivations that they had and because of

452
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,170
the shortsightedness by design of the

453
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,520
system these ambulance drivers work they

454
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,100
do this work because they want to save

455
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,720
more lives right the system didn't put

456
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,649
them in a position where that wasn't in

457
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,200
conflict with their personal goals

458
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:14,150
thankfully most of us are not

459
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,010
necessarily doing work that has such

460
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,350
high stakes okay what we're doing is

461
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,670
important internet security is extremely

462
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,709
important and as we saw in the keynote

463
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:24,500
this morning can have real-life human

464
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,360
consequences that said most of the time

465
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,550
when we're setting KPIs for our security

466
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,530
teams for our engineering teams we have

467
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,860
a little bit more room for error which

468
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:35,720
thankfully okay thankfully what we try

469
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,750
and do in HR is make sure that we don't

470
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,820
have too many of those systems that

471
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,260
produce the wrong result okay it's one

472
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,240
reason why it's screen we don't have

473
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,990
variable salary for anyone in the team

474
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,430
okay Syria variable salary if you

475
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,730
achieve your goals you will be paid more

476
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:54,680
money I do recruitment as part of my job

477
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,790
if you say to me hey Alison at the end

478
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,520
of the month you'll have more money if

479
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,780
you work route 10 people this month who

480
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,960
thinks I'll recruit ten people this

481
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:04,639
month yeah the rest of you know that

482
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,140
convinced I can all right nice thanks

483
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,580
team they say on that ten people by the

484
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:12,210
time we're done yeah over

485
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,320
ten people the right people maybe not

486
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,630
will they still be here in six months

487
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,610
probably not doesn't matter I did the

488
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,930
thing it was very miserable okay so then

489
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,439
you say okay Alison let's get a bit

490
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,820
smarter

491
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,330
you're gonna recruit ten people this

492
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,100
month and after eighteen months

493
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:30,389
ninety percent of those ten people will

494
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,709
still be here alright so at which point

495
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,000
are you paying me this variable and

496
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,560
what's happening month over month and do

497
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,240
we have the predictability will we

498
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,919
always hire ten people per month what

499
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,270
happens if somebody leaves because of

500
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,280
something someone else controls or not

501
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,500
me okay at what point can i impact this

502
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,910
okay and then we kind of abandon it so

503
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,130
we don't pay anybody about a variable

504
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,540
salary at screen because we think that

505
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,190
it doesn't actually produce the right

506
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,230
results we think it can tend to be a

507
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,030
distraction what we do do however is

508
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,830
what I call backward-looking bonuses

509
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,620
okay you know when you sign up to work

510
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,360
for screen what you will be earning okay

511
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,979
you know that where I perform your

512
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,899
organization that you'll do your job

513
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,760
you'll be paid it okay that's the that's

514
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,040
the agreement that said if you have a

515
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,210
particularly exceptional border there's

516
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,220
nothing that stops us from saying hey

517
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,960
here's something you weren't expecting I

518
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,390
have a little extra and that becomes an

519
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,340
actual bonus as opposed to a you know

520
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,960
there's this room for maneuver and maybe

521
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,669
we'll give you eighty seven point five

522
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,990
percent of your variable is not not very

523
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:26,910
motivating if we agree that HR and

524
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,210
security teams should work together do

525
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,470
we agree are we starting to agree does

526
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,820
my turn imply that it's not a choice

527
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,280
yeah okay excellent

528
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,530
excellent okay so we agree we agree that

529
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,030
HR and SEC team should work together but

530
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,879
now let's concentrate on the house okay

531
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,170
so how should they work together you

532
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,190
mentioned earlier by raising awareness

533
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:49,260
okay one particularity about screen in

534
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,500
the security industry is that we refused

535
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:56,010
to market or to sell fear okay so we do

536
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,080
not capitalize on public breaches to

537
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,280
sell our SAS okay

538
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,679
just let that sink in for a minute

539
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,750
that's quite unusual in the industry we

540
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,640
don't market or sell fear which means

541
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,170
internally when we're raising awareness

542
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,090
about security we have a unique

543
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:11,850
challenge which is we will not spread

544
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,679
fear to our employees either how do you

545
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:18,370
educate people about security without

546
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:20,900
fear make it fun I like it

547
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,669
okay challenges and competitions I can

548
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,490
make it engaging make it educative make

549
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:28,610
it yeah make it fun okay absolutely

550
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:30,260
those are some of the things we do one

551
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,510
of the first things we do basically is

552
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,460
to give concrete real-world examples of

553
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,890
attacks so that individuals can

554
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,230
understand how they happen okay how and

555
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:41,450
why they work what that helps to do is

556
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,370
to distance people from the you'd have

557
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,740
to be stupid to click on a fishing line

558
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:48,199
okay what we basically do our CTO says

559
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,520
hey you know here is a spear phishing

560
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,260
attack that I once received you said and

561
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,910
I clicked on the link okay I'm the CTO

562
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,920
and co-founder of a security company and

563
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:57,590
absolutely happens to everybody here's

564
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,330
why okay and here's why it doesn't have

565
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,419
to be this big shameful event if it does

566
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:04,129
happen basically we give them awareness

567
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,690
common attacks how am I they work and

568
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,220
the most important which is an avenue

569
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,810
for recourse if something looks

570
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:13,520
suspicious or if you think you've done

571
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:15,679
something you know onboarding we have a

572
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,290
slide which is our CTO s personal phone

573
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,320
number and the words underneath it which

574
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:23,210
says if you have a doubt call me if it's

575
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,550
3:00 a.m. I would rather be woken up for

576
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,960
nothing then for you to hesitate and not

577
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,669
want to bother me okay and that's pretty

578
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,870
powerful you're on the first date

579
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,970
maybe when there's five of you on the

580
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,699
team okay logical when we start to be

581
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,230
fifty sixty two different time zones two

582
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,020
different continents that starts to be a

583
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:40,580
powerful message so we onboard a junior

584
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,740
sales development rep in San Francisco

585
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,659
they get this training they get JV use

586
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,240
personal phone number and they get the

587
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:52,640
call me if in doubt okay and a few of us

588
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:54,290
have done so so we also give guidelines

589
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,530
to our specific teams through our sales

590
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:59,030
team travel a lot okay so we're

591
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:01,430
basically very careful that's physical

592
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:03,530
security so things like ciphering their

593
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:06,590
laptop okay using privacy screens in the

594
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:08,270
Train custom host names not connecting

595
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,560
to public Wi-Fi things like that that

596
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,240
salespeople who are trying to close a

597
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,760
deal just want basically free anything

598
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,880
so that the paperwork can go through

599
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:19,160
keeping their browsers up-to-date one

600
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,660
effective awareness fun educative

601
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,190
challenge competition if you will that

602
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,290
we use at screen is the cookie method

603
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:27,920
okay this will not be new to a lot of

604
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:29,030
you basically if your laptop or another

605
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,700
device is left on

606
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:34,370
locked in the screen house which is our

607
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,580
offices screeners the people who work

608
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,800
there

609
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,210
stay with me it'll be easy screeners are

610
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,860
allowed to access that device and write

611
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:42,620
cookies on the general slack channels in

612
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,939
an email to the company okay you're told

613
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,550
about the cookie method on your first

614
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,930
day of screen okay

615
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:49,850
the two hours maybe that elapse before

616
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,950
that first meeting is the only time that

617
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:54,409
you're immune and otherwise up from that

618
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,580
day forward okay no device doesn't

619
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,780
matter if it's this telephone doesn't

620
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,040
matter if it's your hope you don't leave

621
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,160
it unlocked an unattended otherwise

622
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:04,720
somebody will purify you as we have made

623
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,980
it over which wasn't pretty creative

624
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,360
about the cookie method okay we're a

625
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,560
security company most people you know

626
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,510
they stand up to your the bathroom they

627
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,470
lops a computer right it's it's not that

628
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,990
hot so you have to get a bit creative

629
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,100
because we're a big fan of cookies feel

630
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,690
free coming in we're talking about

631
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:22,850
cookies of the eating client coming in

632
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:26,270
so one person in our San Francisco team

633
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:28,610
sustained a cookie attack because three

634
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:31,070
members of the team basically fired nerf

635
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:33,110
guns at him repeatedly he ducked below

636
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,850
his desk to take cover leaving his

637
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:40,790
laptop and somebody else came in and

638
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:42,800
worked quickest skateboard events that

639
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,600
we still refer to so if you have a Mac

640
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,610
new repaired Apple watch you can unlock

641
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,750
it you feel the vibration on your wrist

642
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,949
of course but when you're trying out a

643
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,510
brand new skateboard around the office

644
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:52,520
that your colleague is I said hey Dennis

645
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:54,950
want to take a tour you might not notice

646
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,030
okay so running behind picture this so

647
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,520
when running behind someone on a

648
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:02,540
skateboard trying to unlock a right

649
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,670
cookies at the same time the sales team

650
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,409
often take often like to walk around the

651
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,890
office while they're closing deals okay

652
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:11,660
so one team member was behind the screen

653
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:15,140
the glass door out to the patio on his

654
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,880
phone closing a customer with his laptop

655
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:20,630
outside but he left his Bluetooth

656
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,520
keyboard inside so no visual markers

657
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,060
this was quite an impressive one okay so

658
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,129
command space open spotlight on Mac

659
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:29,780
slack in top command okay general and

660
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,700
Intel to switch to the general channel

661
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,820
type cookies and enter with no visual

662
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,960
feedback whatsoever

663
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,280
and one screeners girlfriend actually

664
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,930
cook aside him when he went to the

665
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,000
bathroom at home while working from home

666
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:43,720
okay she doesn't actually doesn't work

667
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,610
for us but this culture has spread

668
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,430
beyond and where all of us went

669
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:53,000
Loic how did it get cook afraid you know

670
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,860
and his girlfriend's claims so we

671
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,960
started to go beyond the first circle

672
00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:02,120
right the security is getting larger and

673
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,230
larger absolutely absolutely I mean

674
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,809
you're rewarded for your hard work

675
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:08,179
always boys and it's become quite the

676
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:10,250
competition now we're a big fan of

677
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:13,130
cookies sort of extent of food we like

678
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,540
to cook so each time somebody has cook a

679
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,250
fight the challenge is to raise the

680
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,780
level of what gets brought in okay so

681
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,340
it's started to get a little bit

682
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,950
ridiculous

683
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,178
I'll have it known that in 16 months

684
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:30,980
working at screen I have never once been

685
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:35,110
Kouga by challenge my laptop is here it

686
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:38,030
is not connected to the Wi-Fi fabulous

687
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:40,340
beyond that we also do security theme

688
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:42,139
nights at screen we're a member of the

689
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,939
team basically takes two days and

690
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,410
prepares a security type challenge for

691
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,050
all of us to work on for sort of three

692
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:50,600
hours at night one of them my favorite

693
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:54,559
one was learning how to execute a DDoS

694
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:58,189
attack I got into security very much by

695
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,480
accident I was teaching English to a lot

696
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,600
of people in business in France when I

697
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,740
first moved from Australia and I ended

698
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,290
up teaching English to an entire

699
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,370
Department of Engineers and I had the

700
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,860
head of infrastructure as one of my

701
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:11,149
first students and he came in and it was

702
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,399
explaining to me why he hadn't done any

703
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,780
Singlish oh boy he said well listen you

704
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,040
know I was up all night responding to an

705
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,100
incident we had a DDoS attack

706
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,360
listen okay no problem your your

707
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,649
homework was to explain something

708
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,250
specific about your drug so we're gonna

709
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,080
do that today

710
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,670
he said here I'm gonna ask me to explain

711
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,899
a DDoS attack in English I don't you

712
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,990
know I barely have the words so that's

713
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:33,020
exactly what we're gonna do so he spent

714
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:35,020
15 minutes in a mix of French and

715
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:38,420
English basically explaining to me that

716
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,920
if you have a lot of computers okay but

717
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,600
not actual computers okay they might not

718
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,970
be real computers and all at one place

719
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,879
there's a bunch of traffic to one server

720
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:48,800
that you could crash a website

721
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,180
I started to ask him questions I said

722
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:56,050
how many computers I said how much time

723
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:59,480
what sort of websites could we take down

724
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:01,639
and quite inadvertently he gave me a you

725
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,910
know sort of entry into the industry and

726
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,800
how things could work so when I join

727
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,900
screen one of the first things I said

728
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,139
was okay we agree if I join a security

729
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:14,420
company you'll teach me how to do some

730
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:17,690
cool things yeah and the CTO said well

731
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,850
listen I can't explicitly hand you the

732
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,220
tools to doing anything illegal of

733
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:24,560
course we wouldn't do that but if by

734
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,850
chance over time you know we taught you

735
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,610
enough that you then went and made a

736
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:30,580
decision on your own that would be fine

737
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:33,469
so my favorite hack night was DDoS

738
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:35,149
learning how to execute a DDoS attacks I

739
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:38,300
was very disappointed to learn that for

740
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:40,340
a very small sum I could actually just

741
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,560
pay somebody that I'd know it was it was

742
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,990
it was very sad I wanted to do it myself

743
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,389
but also not go to jail right which is

744
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:49,480
sort of the story of my life yeah

745
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,890
conflicting desires conflicting desires

746
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,450
so apart from the hack nights in the

747
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:57,230
cuckoo's vacation we have a great

748
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:59,420
onboarding for security and we use pedro

749
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:01,130
judy has a really great fishing training

750
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:04,190
if you've ever seen it very interactive

751
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:06,370
basically fishing or not fishing which

752
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:09,310
is good fun for teams everybody can play

753
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:14,030
and it came in handy actually last night

754
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:16,250
so every quarter at screen we do q3 of a

755
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,420
quarter release demo day okay so

756
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:20,270
whatever the teams have been working on

757
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,830
for three months we invite customers we

758
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,720
invite prospects we invite our investors

759
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,429
we invite the general public to come to

760
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,230
our offices and to basically see what

761
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,230
we've worked on for three months our

762
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,220
co-founders are formerly from Apple okay

763
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,470
so there's a little bit of that echo

764
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:36,410
there as well it's a big day it was last

765
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:39,380
night I was watching remotely from my

766
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:41,360
hotel room in Amsterdam and right after

767
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,970
we finished the demo I received an email

768
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,340
from Pia ICU

769
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:47,540
subject line urgent hey Alison do you

770
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,689
have time to do something really quickly

771
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,950
for me bye mate okay earlier that

772
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,420
morning Pierre had actually sent me an

773
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,010
email that was very similar to that okay

774
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,510
we're trying to close a vice president

775
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,309
of marketing in San Francisco who needed

776
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,289
to give notice by

777
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:00,908
ence T okay and we had all these things

778
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:02,440
moving around in San Francisco it wasn't

779
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:04,240
away couldn't call our lawyers couldn't

780
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,110
get board approval for shares and things

781
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,110
like that it came in handy but I'd had

782
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:13,928
this fishing training pretty recently it

783
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:15,879
also came in handy that one other piece

784
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:20,860
that I'll talk about which is emotional

785
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:25,168
intelligence okay say if I were a highly

786
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:27,490
strong type-a overachieving HR manager

787
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:29,320
there's a chance that seeing his urgent

788
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,869
email at 11:00 p.m. last night when I'm

789
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,570
traveling would have stopped something

790
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:36,459
okay I might have sparked my fear but

791
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,980
I'd done something wrong or it might

792
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,869
have triggered my impostor syndrome or

793
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,309
it might have triggered me into saying

794
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:45,279
okay whatever it is I need to drop

795
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:48,039
everything and do it now thankfully I am

796
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,169
none of those things or at least I'm

797
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:51,850
aware of those things okay and so the

798
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:55,029
first thing I did obviously was text him

799
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:57,369
and say hey Pierre and look closely and

800
00:30:55,029 --> 00:31:00,909
so there was an extra in chair in his

801
00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:03,549
name in another company without that

802
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:05,139
kind of fun memorable fishing training I

803
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:06,759
probably wouldn't have made the made the

804
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:09,549
link I also did that training 16 months

805
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:10,690
ago it turned out everybody in the

806
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:11,860
company had received some sort of a

807
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,419
phishing email right after our demo

808
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,539
which if you want to know if you're

809
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:17,860
doing interesting things that's a good

810
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:19,509
good validation that we were doing

811
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,668
interesting things and then our q3 demo

812
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:22,990
was quite a success I won't say anymore

813
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:24,249
if you're interested come and see me

814
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,590
later

815
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:28,029
we also offer in addition to this type

816
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,820
of training we also offer across the

817
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:32,259
device password manager as a perk

818
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,749
because we don't hire a lot of security

819
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:36,850
professionals 90% of the employees at

820
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:38,379
screen had never worked in security

821
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:41,199
before okay we have a very small team of

822
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:42,869
security engineers three people everyone

823
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,210
else basically is either a software

824
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:48,610
engineer sales team member products or

825
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:51,639
support we do that on purpose okay

826
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:53,258
because we're not building in the old

827
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:56,019
way of things we're building in the new

828
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:57,909
way things okay so everybody's starting

829
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:59,470
out in security which means we carry a

830
00:31:57,909 --> 00:32:03,070
higher risk which means awareness and

831
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:05,080
training is big for us but the most

832
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:07,178
powerful thing security teams in HR can

833
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,230
do as a group benefit is to establish a

834
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:12,030
security first culture I might

835
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,590
like just a little parenthesis here what

836
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,270
is culture because people get really

837
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,889
confused about what it actually is and

838
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:19,280
isn't what is a company culture any

839
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,280
ideas

840
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:37,950
okay the norms the basics absolutely

841
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:40,080
the values okay okay internal motivation

842
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,059
okay it feels like the right thing to do

843
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,520
okay

844
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:48,540
attitudes yeah goals

845
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:50,850
yep yeah nice Netflix defines it pretty

846
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,309
well they say it's basically what gets

847
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:56,129
rewarded tolerated and punished okay

848
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:57,600
what are the things so the norms so what

849
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,250
just goes on all day every day and is

850
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,740
okay what sort of jokes can I make in

851
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:03,600
the open space without retribution who

852
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:07,470
gets promoted who gets fired and why who

853
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:12,000
gets hired who doesn't and why having a

854
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:13,830
security first culture sounds like maybe

855
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,450
we have like a multi door system at

856
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,590
screen was like retina scanners right

857
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,929
security first all right

858
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:20,790
everybody through here that we keep out

859
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:21,990
office address offline you know nobody

860
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:26,100
knows actually where we're hiding out

861
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:28,500
doing the security that we keep out all

862
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,760
about Apple accessories under lock and

863
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,450
key at all times

864
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,580
that we have a strong email filter on

865
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:37,200
that subject one of my very first I'm so

866
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,270
excited you got to use your sign 10

867
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,610
minutes 10 minutes team that's alright

868
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,730
one of my very first hecho jobs I worked

869
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,780
in an oil and gas company in Australia

870
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,240
IVA starts with implementing a new

871
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,918
parental leave policy including the

872
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,490
establishment of lactation rooms in our

873
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,470
headquarters every week I would have to

874
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,179
go to the IT department and ask them

875
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,429
very nicely they would release my very

876
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:00,960
safe for working house from the national

877
00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:02,280
breastfeeding Association of Australia

878
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,240
that were being called me and I'll

879
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,740
filter every day this as just as a side

880
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,840
note this is why we need more diversity

881
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,190
and software engineering and security

882
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,470
teams because these types of filters

883
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:16,530
being set up by a certain population and

884
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:18,689
legitimate things get caught so my first

885
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:20,760
my first entry into the security world

886
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,418
was can you explain to me why

887
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,320
female containing potentially a

888
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:28,679
pornography it should be released into

889
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,810
your cat which was good fun here it's

890
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,730
free here at screen we have a security

891
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:34,620
first policy but an open-door policy as

892
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:36,690
well which means you can walk into

893
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,460
either of our offices in Paris or San

894
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:40,230
Francisco if you need a desk for the day

895
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,899
and I encourage you if you are in either

896
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,699
of their cities to come and see us we'll

897
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,560
give you Wi-Fi you'll be able to see our

898
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,699
dashboards in real time you can see our

899
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,350
revenue you can see our number of

900
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:50,730
customers you can see the bugs we're

901
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,310
currently fixing in which agent they

902
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:56,219
occur you can hear our conversations you

903
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,980
can see our springboard that's something

904
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:01,740
that we do very openly our CEO has been

905
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:04,020
known to meet direct competitors at

906
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,240
events not dissimilar to this and

907
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:09,990
explain our entire 18-month strategy

908
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,759
okay we are a very open company for a

909
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,470
security company for one reason we

910
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,950
believe in value okay and we don't think

911
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:18,720
that secrecy or fear is the way to a

912
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:21,689
more secure future we believe openness

913
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,169
okay sharing human vulnerability that

914
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:27,350
leads to less system vulnerability our

915
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,460
number one defense against attacks

916
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:30,750
actually probably our number two defense

917
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,180
and number one defense against the text

918
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:36,090
is our end product screen and over to

919
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:37,850
defense psychological safety okay who

920
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:43,890
ther knows what psychological safety is

921
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:48,420
yeah what is it it's tough to define

922
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:50,160
actually okay thinking that yeah okay

923
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,710
thinking you're secure it's the belief

924
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,220
that you can take a risk or make a

925
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,150
mistake without being punished okay it

926
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,589
doesn't mean that there aren't there

927
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,630
isn't a flow-on effects but that you

928
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,360
won't be punished for taking a risk or

929
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,380
making a mistake

930
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,210
who here in this room has already

931
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:14,880
personally fallen victim to a phishing

932
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:18,500
attack yeah okay he's not a difficult

933
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,500
thing to admit in a security conference

934
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:25,620
yeah it can be it can be right it can be

935
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,850
my feeling is the real number is

936
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,470
actually a little higher than hands that

937
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:31,759
were raised we haven't we haven't missed

938
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,379
Sara Lee I've tried but we haven't

939
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,910
necessarily established a culture of

940
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,320
psychological safety here today

941
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:40,640
give me another half a hour and maybe I

942
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,470
will but basically if we have a lot of

943
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,368
cultures in engineering and technology

944
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:48,140
and security that are very based on the

945
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:49,910
fact that our knowledge will protect us

946
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,220
okay we are good at our jobs we are

947
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:54,589
smart we are smarter than most okay

948
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,970
there's no way I would fall for

949
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,430
something like that I have such good

950
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:01,848
training I work with an excellent

951
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:04,368
security engineer Cedric who just built

952
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:05,480
an incredible POC but if you're

953
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:07,430
interested in I can tell you more about

954
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,890
but he basically works for Apple for

955
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:13,460
about 10 years and did some of the first

956
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:15,140
Dale breaks on the iPhones and he's the

957
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,180
first one to tell you that it would be

958
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,830
so easy to get him in a phishing attack

959
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,598
why you like to be like I would be able

960
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,069
to get him to clean you like concretely

961
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,119
I'd know exactly what I would do if I

962
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,890
want to Center it typically put on the

963
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,119
Lich's link and I've told him I said

964
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,970
this is how it would happen said er can

965
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:31,520
I share a passion for a hot metal and we

966
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:33,080
often go to concerts together okay super

967
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,089
easy hey Cedric I just took a ticket for

968
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:38,060
this concert if you're interested click

969
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:42,349
the link if I want to okay super easy

970
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:45,349
because why okay closeness vulnerability

971
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:48,290
also feeling of belonging things like

972
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:49,670
that he now only other vices own tickets

973
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:52,450
it tells me who made me that set of

974
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,450
that's a different story

975
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:56,869
psychological safety is required okay

976
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:58,490
you're fooling yourself if you think you

977
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:02,660
can have rules and punishment and also

978
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:05,990
have a secure technology company

979
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:08,990
anything like that the ability to say

980
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:11,180
hey JB el sitio I think I downloaded a

981
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:13,490
harmful file yesterday when I was

982
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,980
traveling yeah can you take my machine

983
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:18,439
and look I changed my password already

984
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:21,410
but can you just see what happened and

985
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:24,980
know that I won't be punished I won't be

986
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:26,868
ridiculed okay and that at the end of

987
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:30,260
the day it'll be used to teach other

988
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:32,089
people something beyond justice the

989
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,710
impacts on security a great company

990
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:37,119
culture is one we're speaking up is

991
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:39,290
routine okay there are a lot of

992
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,760
professions around the world where if

993
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:43,369
you can't speak up and say that you've

994
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,109
made a mistake people might die

995
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:46,880
okay the medical profession if you can't

996
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:48,109
speak up and say hey I have a bad

997
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,579
feeling about that so through yesterday

998
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:50,749
I think we should go back here okay you

999
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:53,599
need to be able to speak up

1000
00:38:50,749 --> 00:38:55,339
and the risk of looking dumb I think

1001
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,200
this might be the hardest part in

1002
00:38:55,339 --> 00:39:00,319
technology and security companies the

1003
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:04,490
ability to look dumb okay recently looks

1004
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:05,869
dumb doing something yeah yeah it's not

1005
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,609
a great feeling right when you're right

1006
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:08,630
at all

1007
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:09,950
you kind of hoped you might have less

1008
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:11,509
suppose me or some of you like it

1009
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:13,279
apparently like looking dumb I like it

1010
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:16,579
this is great security first looking

1011
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:18,019
done I love looking stupid unfortunately

1012
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:20,019
life tends to lead me to a lot of

1013
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:21,799
situations where that's the case I

1014
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:22,549
recently learned how to ride a

1015
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:25,309
motorcycle

1016
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:27,259
now I hadn't ridden a bicycle in about

1017
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:29,779
15 years and I don't have a driver's

1018
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:32,420
license so this was possibly an

1019
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:35,089
ill-advised ill-advised adventure but my

1020
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:37,970
very first lesson the teacher was like I

1021
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:39,589
knew you're being you know but like how

1022
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,509
do you even just walk around you have no

1023
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:42,288
sense of balance and I said okay look

1024
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:45,589
excellent

1025
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:47,539
great 30 years old you can't do what

1026
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:49,430
most toddlers are doing doing very well

1027
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:53,749
so that was humbling that was very

1028
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:54,980
humbling looking dumb it's something

1029
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:56,749
that we should cultivate it should

1030
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,670
happen serve regularly you know

1031
00:39:56,749 --> 00:40:01,939
organizations we're in every meeting we

1032
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:03,710
can say hey Jim our VP of Sales I'm

1033
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,809
sorry I know you've told me 10,000 times

1034
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:07,039
what a RR is but I still can't remember

1035
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:08,900
okay which one is that

1036
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,420
or conversion rates we use a lot of

1037
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,519
acronyms and what tends to happen in

1038
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,289
rooms full of smart people is we smile

1039
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,058
an on dog I'll go and look that up later

1040
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:18,470
okay I don't want to look I want to look

1041
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:20,210
silly in front of all these small people

1042
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:22,069
they hired me I think I'm positive I

1043
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,539
encourage you to do the opposite I

1044
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:25,700
encourage your particularly fear leaders

1045
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:27,259
in meetings like that where there are a

1046
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,879
bunch of different people one simple

1047
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:31,160
thing we do is anytime an acronym is

1048
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,019
used in a team meeting it screen one of

1049
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,609
the leaders says oh sorry Jim when you

1050
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:36,919
say ARR you mean annual recurring

1051
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:38,450
revenue right and it stops maybe the

1052
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,039
first year the most junior employee or

1053
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,489
the most recently arrived from having to

1054
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,019
do it

1055
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:45,680
but because they've seen the leaders do

1056
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:47,988
it okay it's fine it's normal so we do a

1057
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,890
lot of things publicly to make sure that

1058
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:49,800
that becomes our north

1059
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:52,770
okay that book

1060
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,690
the right behavior we share on our side

1061
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:56,340
channel screenshots saying hey team be

1062
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,620
careful I think this is a phishing email

1063
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,760
okay we share that and everyone kind of

1064
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,200
claps and everyone's like wow good

1065
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,860
that's great okay we'll go and have a

1066
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,899
look psychological safety is the ability

1067
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,010
to be vulnerable okay if you want to

1068
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,930
remember one thing about the talk

1069
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:12,930
psychological safety the ability to be

1070
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:15,480
vulnerable vulnerability in humans is

1071
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,600
good for avoiding vulnerabilities in

1072
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:21,360
your systems and technology okay

1073
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:22,279
vulnerabilities okay OS top 10 bad human

1074
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:27,050
vulnerability

1075
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,050
good thank you very much

1076
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:38,600
does anyone have any questions all right

1077
00:41:54,470 --> 00:42:01,529
HR department how is that something you

1078
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:03,810
can bring to them okay I repeat the

1079
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:05,880
question for the video correct yeah

1080
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:07,560
fabulous okay so question was some

1081
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,510
echoes of Britney Browns take on

1082
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,580
vulnerability which by the way hugely

1083
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:13,440
flatted a big fan of hers so loved that

1084
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,480
that's coming through the question was

1085
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,010
how can you scale this sort of thing or

1086
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,900
how can you roll it out across a 10,000

1087
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:21,900
person company as opposed to a 50 person

1088
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:25,950
company yeah I think it comes back to

1089
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:30,240
the same things it comes down to this

1090
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:31,890
happened very quickly so we speak

1091
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,359
English in the office despite the fact

1092
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:38,279
that like 70 percent of the people are

1093
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:39,570
French it takes one conversation in

1094
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,920
French in the open space for that to

1095
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:42,900
catch fire and all of a sudden never

1096
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,760
have speaks French all day there are

1097
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,040
certain things that have like an

1098
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,620
exponential impact so it's things like

1099
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,270
in that big organization it's obviously

1100
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,250
leadership alignment it's saying hey

1101
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:55,980
we're making vulnerability human

1102
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:58,560
vulnerability a whole knock of how we

1103
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,440
hire how we onboard our employer

1104
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,020
branding this is where hay chopping kind

1105
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,090
of go full employee cycle okay and roll

1106
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:08,070
that out from hey the messaging we do

1107
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:10,080
about screen is not we have the best

1108
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:11,220
company in the world there is one

1109
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,670
company who does that messaging its

1110
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:16,350
Twitter I would not necessarily think

1111
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:17,670
that Twitter actually has a great site

1112
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:18,930
the psychological safety culture

1113
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,060
somewhere I can see from the outside

1114
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,259
it's very hard when you have claims like

1115
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,580
we are the best okay

1116
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,570
that screen would say hey we're doing a

1117
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,340
bunch of things that we think are pretty

1118
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,690
interesting but there's a chance those

1119
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,820
things we're not doing come on in and

1120
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:31,800
help us learn about them so I think it's

1121
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,830
across that whole chain leadership

1122
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,330
buy-in and the I come from a background

1123
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,549
of change management it's always about

1124
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:40,080
figuring out who the influences are and

1125
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,470
if you find in a 10,000 person

1126
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,730
organization that your main influences

1127
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,149
are the opposite of the culture you're

1128
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:50,230
trying to instill this

1129
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:52,990
two options right one of them is clean

1130
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:54,369
house and and and the other one is

1131
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:56,459
except that your culture probably won't

1132
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:56,460
change

1133
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:03,709
[Applause]
