22
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,430
ok I have come to believe and less

tub Jack inthe ok said

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,270
a.m. the sad moment is something that
and

26
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,910
is an unexpected twist pictures in the
film and

27
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,410
is quiet quite the twist in the in the
in the film and

28
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,410
I'm it applies to health problems from
bility a

29
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,670
i was thinkin outside the box China and

30
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,000
think so where to exploits something
that what done it was over an ability

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,880
but I wasn't sure how to exploit it

32
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,060
so it's a clever thing we did see Korean

33
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,140
and people might myosin

34
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,620
the functional say problem the heritage
USA

35
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:40,959
am but nobody thought way of exploiting
CA NJ and afterwards you think oh yeah

36
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,440
explains a lot us and bezel a.m.

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,260
absolute URL's so absolute you as a
complete

38
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,720
there the specified full URL and and
passes

39
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,079
the the Prosecco and is no guesswork
involved

40
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:03,579
to the browser but the result in a
process called relative URL snow that's

41
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:04,060
different

42
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,250
Recife URL's debt depending on the
structure the sites he couldn't say dot

43
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,060
dot slash

44
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,810
eek you can go in the document this
something not quite right ball out

45
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,109
browse guess you where it thinks you are
in the document so the 70 is the file

46
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:27,070
the browser's no idea sons guess which
the browser

47
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,980
so I consider that if you are less
harmful and I'll show you why

48
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,240
severe you visit a site

49
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,290
and seal this the CSS disappear

50
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,610
and usually if you perform a slash in
there

51
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,630
the URL to leave pets St website for
example

52
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,980
you'll see the CSS disappear something
is awry and I wonder why

53
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,560
why with by what's happening so upset

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,670
I'm fabled looks at his request and the

55
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,810
the big the behavior when you prefer
asked for was slashing the following day

56
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,890
and was different he that the CSS
disappeared

57
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,720
and the CSS my return 0 for 403 alt ok

58
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,320
gone said the massive past

59
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,500
commitment a.m. reference style sheet
say

60
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,480
and shed the slash the URL

61
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,090
and a doesn't doesn't expect I am

62
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,870
the site sides expect you to have to
insert slash

63
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,280
and therefore results the CSS following
a different way said

64
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,490
suicides at a different location what's
interesting is

65
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,530
the other it said the four or 430 to
health yet so you might not notice

66
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,370
because

67
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,830
you mean you might wonder why and PC
Suite it feel to

68
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,950
she performs a ship because surely
outside the facts

69
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,790
so that embodied develops website with a
relative

70
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,030
step a CSS URL I dot hands open a
breadth

71
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:08,240
yeah all known that many of them do more
than that Chico could be on both

72
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,110
sale

73
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,130
a.m. if you at the slash and

74
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,400
the you are always changing the expected
URL is provided

75
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,070
so comp the

76
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,400
the URL the you gonna get he's different
than what is expected am

77
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,630
so what happens is

78
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,180
the eager to read this

79
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,740
did the the recipe I was passed but it's
actually

80
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,050
a.m. in bed it is actually executed on
the I'm

81
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,940
injected page the CSS follow is actually
going

82
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,919
and to the hasty male page instead s SF
CSS file

83
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,970
sus it RP always

84
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,550
relative path over act a strapon and
technique networks

85
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,110
am blessed with CSS but it work in other
areas as well

86
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:10,520
call it appeal see need some pics
persistent text on the page

87
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,880
than I such for example he's name

88
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:21,400
and a male subject header or something
like that unita events if poss

89
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,099
the references Style Sheets onion

90
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,300
the browser will then to the style she
and I execute called so

91
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,889
pic K it will and

92
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,789
what for the CSS file that you specified
and but it lacks the excuse some haste

93
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:38,550
email page

94
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,710
and the persistent X invented will be
executed

95
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,889
works i of obviously gump

96
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:50,780
sought to understand how how to exploit
it needs

97
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:56,280
quelques SS lesson am salt what's
interesting about specification

98
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,470
I think it's in CSS 2.1 and

99
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,159
use urges must ignore the Style Sheets

100
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:06,780
and when eg ignore the styles when it
counts is

101
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,360
I'm an invalid rule am so mad you can
take advantage of that

102
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,830
and by had and in the CSS selector

103
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,420
and then executing the had the CSS

104
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,840
sup so I

105
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,880
if we can get the best 2.0 web page

106
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:34,160
and contain CSS may be commensurate so
use the CSS selector

107
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,410
you connect you can make egg Norway
what's happened before

108
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,280
so I'll if the you best in you lol

109
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,440
he's been sent to web page and Kansas St
male

110
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,500
you can make nor the taste email called

111
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,390
which slipped thousand things is CSS
expressions are strained

112
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:03,260
basal expression just created pet testis
so the webpage concerns relative

113
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,860
URL so that the shortest action will be
just a forward slash

114
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,650
so once the first Ashes appended onto
the URL

115
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,660
the relative path this change some other
develops if you're always changed to

116
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,890
points paced him up style she looked a

117
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,800
its lowest level a CSS what you'll see
if you look at the

118
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,620
network I'm you'll see pointed to this
article

119
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,960
a he'll you see pointed to the a.m.

120
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,210
slashed add lead page

121
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,400
and then ill look for the CSS within the
web page

122
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,530
so all Nate need to have the right tools
and enabled

123
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,510
or and in a statement him you might I
think a speed on that by

124
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,830
default supports and pretty URL's

125
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,540
see need you need a pretty URLs asleep
as it's called

126
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,040
am and so what what's happened what's
happening is that you actually the

127
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,790
shirts in styles Nazi SS

128
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:06,600
the rush reference in the php file so
this is how it works

129
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,149
stop courtesy

130
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,510
and so Thessaly you close the CSS
lighter

131
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,760
injecting a global will had cake

132
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,820
excuse expression the classic style
sheets

133
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,950
is lauded and and the left but the whole
page

134
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:30,950
unjust jets forward slash what with
whatever you are really want so double

135
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,399
slash what if some deployed I dot slash
in

136
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,660
could could exploit up likely Seth

137
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,820
actually not a hell ask

138
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,380
bach IP at same ip:

139
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,950
celeb the plaza comes up

140
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,149
see if it a.m. and said Dada slash a
divisive URL

141
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:57,700
it looks of the woods in the direction
she obviously but the browser doesn't

142
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,250
know all

143
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:06,930
Rep follies on the server knows what the
phallus social provide fit directory

144
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,709
then we can send the URL back to SL
three ep

145
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:14,880
for example slashed a dietary

146
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,930
whatever so then

147
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,640
the style she is unloaded back onto
itself the N bomb myself the

148
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:30,230
that page the pair web page and
expressions where can I see compatible

149
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:37,709
9 sport you can use acronyms to

150
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:43,830
him downgrade the website and execute
expressions

151
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,070
and next public talk is about mutation
XSS

152
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,100
and me my real cable with the Nets

153
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,300
so happens when

154
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,420
paste email me tips from a safe step
from

155
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,190
and on from a safe states wouldn't say
if states am

156
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,440
so you have a specially valid hey smell
had troutman

157
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,850
the looks if and they said yes but Wed
and

158
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,710
when the in a hasty mel is bad admitted

159
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:21,070
and is mutated into to come and insisted
so well with best through with the

160
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:27,210
the actual place to a party to be rather
called and as many ways to do this

161
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:34,970
actually call calls XHTML hey smell
confusion and CSS strings URL

162
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,310
but the public art in stuff all happens
I

163
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,650
so

164
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,200
does the classic back to the you sick
Hasegawa came up with

165
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,400
so basically brand image and

166
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,730
element found in the title was to back
tix

167
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,200
and when when ish rewritten

168
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,470
when in a hasty management and then
britain and get rear end and the

169
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,320
on our and Hundley gets executed

170
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,530
and it was previously in the tax law to
read you sick ass ago I discovered a

171
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,760
am and he's the birth

172
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,100
he discovered beautician XSP specialises
in

173
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,660
the bet on it him

174
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,680
did recognize the seller in i seven but
now it's patched

175
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,850
unfortunately so

176
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,830
maybe you can do so confused the the the
parser

177
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,190
a.m. with XHTML like fact is

178
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:40,880
and in haste email so maybe can confuse
a into thinking this still inside that

179
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,910
should be and therefore vendor entities

180
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,690
so for example

181
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,940
I'm X and P tak

182
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,800
a.m. this is

183
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,250
add the solid strained

184
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,060
is it is a militia specially notice a
forward slash

185
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,910
on the year the end of the

186
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:09,220
a woman named when actually written

187
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,370
and it gets a the the source code get
sparse

188
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,490
the its is get parsed closes the XMP tak

189
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:22,640
and executes the action and that works
in IE 9 compat mode

190
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,630
he also said

191
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,329
you said Mexican style script comments

192
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:35,110
XML Sault Ste

193
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:40,750
the this an example with style so when
in haste emerge bad in Britain

194
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:46,779
okay meted so

195
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:50,230
another tag that meet its is the

196
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,740
at in IE to hasty male a like

197
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,220
comments tak and they say is so fly ASP

198
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,420
and when people that hey I'm we're
putting

199
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,200
ASP that and hasty now backs nothing
that's way

200
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,970
where it came from behaves like a
comment what brand is actually two

201
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,149
different versions I

202
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:16,060
sell for example amp

203
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,790
the attribute here his hosting a link or
did and and if you know I S

204
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,180
they great outside his clothes in the

205
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,250
and the attributes and then

206
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,079
the actually was encoded and that will
get decoded

207
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,410
and that meet its am into

208
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:38,130
months estate the so as you can see a.m.

209
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:43,120
the hay straw posses full because and
within the attributes the

210
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,240
great outside is clear zinc

211
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,019
the tag itself but he still thinks it's
enough to beat say

212
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,370
carries on renders the pasted up

213
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,900
that works in 99 salt that

214
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,810
is is a record deal where old a.m.
example

215
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,910
up mutation XSS so what

216
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:11,010
lester searching google for example to
the search for a.m.

217
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:16,440
an Indian title and then ashram and then
had put it smacks of dot com

218
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,070
and then manually put the

219
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:25,779
browser into I E eight more went to
print preview is clicked

220
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:32,580
we get interesting mizell and the title
mutates within the print preview itself

221
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,610
so a even though this is a

222
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,890
pay for sex trade and when you do the
search in Google

223
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,180
when you click Print reviewing the
tickets and executes the action

224
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,700
nice print preview from bill to just do
a search for

225
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,460
DUP string God Creek Chrissy ashram in
the print preview itself

226
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,920
sale

227
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,750
how committee a.m. simulated I'm

228
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,430
what you need to do is and basically be
tried in haste email

229
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,940
you can do that with a quick shot got
their just cause and document a body dot

230
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,150
in haste email plus equals and then

231
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,350
like strength and that meter in his team
itself

232
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,839
so when yet it causes mutations

233
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:28,760
the if you do it multiple times you can
have multiple levels a mutation

234
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,779
so a.m. he cut like doubling corded
headset

235
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:38,060
paste Malachi ad States and then it
would be decoded multiple times after

236
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,950
that the in haste knowledge by two men

237
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,200
so

238
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,760
yet there is to fill up a very little
and get

239
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,160
is a simple decor DK slashed laps slash

240
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,240
and XSS that will be right

241
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:00,460
I'm the in haste email and give you a
preview

242
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,150
so a couple of legacy id: books

243
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:08,830
and you can actually manipulate

244
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,050
I'm case and using that global reference

245
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,520
and to the anchor am what happens is

246
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,890
so she referenced the

247
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,740
and anchor as X I'll

248
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,130
and what happens is quite unexpected
really

249
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,630
because when he set the the variable

250
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,280
transcripts URL and the

251
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:44,820
encased hey Travis changed so the jobs
could be you lol

252
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:51,130
is I'm injected into the hatred of
attributes have the anchor

253
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,610
about Lexie Cup

254
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:02,710
another trick is

255
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,800
a.m. you kid BS and functions from

256
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,500
I'm within the art with javascript
function call a.m.

257
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,900
so basically she got injection and

258
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,620
within a.m. a function call and it's not
common

259
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:24,020
you can bypass the I XSS filter

260
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,560
so if you access occurs there just

261
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,410
you can be defined a.m. some function
and to let

262
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:40,680
and that will execute excess so that

263
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,780
him book and is friend Austin

264
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,360
so for Gloucester's a.m. can be attacked
easy dunk like tom coburn

265
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,090
so dead kept separate base that means
that you can I'm

266
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,780
full and JavaScript object

267
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,480
and in be where you see something else

268
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,770
so and should therefore

269
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,500
he couldn't overwrite references to
location

270
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,970
so classic straight

271
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,860
for poster is top got location to cycle
self

272
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,480
and then self-taught location Eagles top
location so basically if you actually

273
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,470
was framed

274
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,840
and and the direct is a.m.

275
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,080
at the place by the parent URL

276
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,260
so that 3 the as a reduction from the
parent URL

277
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:37,450
if they're if the decisive strength

278
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,940
social control the top object that we
could execute XSS because

279
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,520
if with actually and using the

280
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,540
top object and poet the self object

281
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,540
and then and we can the on

282
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,040
when if he gets redirected we can
execute XSS

283
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,760
so I'm for my day for example equals top

284
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,260
location because JavaScript URL so

285
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,960
the Jets just to occur before the framed
poster in order for it to execute

286
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,010
am so

287
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,100
and niad hates to my last to be teased

288
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,870
decoded and the location assignment is
also decoded

289
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,040
so we can double and cold art vector

290
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:34,639
amp

291
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:34,990
so

292
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,190
you could slide felt the have so

293
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,200
location so if we give the

294
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,929
for them ID a values top and location

295
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:48,240
JavaScript hamper sound and then 58

296
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,840
to let wild and that will be decoded
brent's

297
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,850
as the Hoechst email attributes so the
up some will be called

298
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,730
who will be decoded and then when the
location simon says

299
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,840
and fired that nobody called again

300
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,460
salt with the double he quickened double
decode

301
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:15,880
the attributes sale

302
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,419
a.m. if the junction occurs

303
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:23,250
a good day the expectable their a.m.

304
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,330
we can bypass the the chrome excess
filter

305
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,809
am thought that's by design for if they

306
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:33,760
and double courses fell to track sample

307
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,360
a.m. we could get hey external version
of it

308
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:46,000
that bypasses the crumple

309
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,970
so here a.m. we close the script tag
projects

310
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,640
SPG because with reject SPG to put

311
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,700
the posse it's a am hacen el

312
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,830
and so ill décor tasty balanced is

313
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,370
within the SD within the SPG script and

314
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,880
salt this will bypass a crop filter am

315
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,500
the and in script I'm will break out at
the

316
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:17,440
variable and then XQ so hot

317
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,169
in a way to bypass the a excess of said
the system patched

318
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:25,240
and you kid and

319
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,850
if you've got an existing script block
and the the case after the injection

320
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,100
then and we can inject a script

321
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,200
and then pointed to address URL and then

322
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,500
we me he hates cum cuts in its the
second the last part iv:

323
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,909
the string with her name the injection

324
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:48,049
ham with the reflected to help on the
page

325
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:51,120
and that will that will back us thought

326
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,690
and that's an example so they

327
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,970
ABC poll the end is required because we
need the clothes in script

328
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,149
eggs in chrome I'm the the script

329
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:07,149
and Dick Weiss unending quoth unending

330
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:11,419
and script tag and even though ship
before slash

331
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:16,100
am after the the script name here he
still won't work

332
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:23,290
am so yeah and that's how it works

333
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:27,140
I he was winnable to add matter cursed

334
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,190
coach are set injection and now

335
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,500
dispatched so if there was ever a simple
black person could just inject

336
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,310
the choice at and give your YouTube
seven and then execute

337
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:42,990
for the tax on now and the from

338
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,450
the and patch the hex TT

339
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,080
p eek with and attribute but they sure
got that

340
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,520
better can also have it char set I think
originally

341
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,680
a.m. the did detect not

342
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:05,460
am so maybe some aggression

343
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,550
so I E a also black is black ink tank
rejections

344
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,790
and this is because and she

345
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,250
doubling called your excess specter
inject Bianca

346
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,250
then you when the clickable link

347
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,400
year you will bypass a filter an excuse
XSS

348
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:30,650
so the the regex really basically just
blocks the hit rest basically a bypass

349
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,190
that use the form action

350
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,320
but that has now been patched his phone
fortune so well

351
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,590
the formation a basically works by

352
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,680
Jackson hadn't and had an element

353
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,640
and then the in court in the excess
specter

354
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,900
then give the bottom the form action and
am

355
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,200
which were paid to your YouTube did you
are I'll

356
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,420
the the patient your own and then him

357
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,880
keV a style that cause a page

358
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,700
and then absolute up sleep positions
well and clicking on the bottom would

359
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,520
resubmit

360
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,050
your head in field back to the page and
that would execute

361
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,870
excess battle settler so

362
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,910
this genetic methods bypass both the IE
and Chrome filter

363
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:21,330
and whatever aside

364
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,400
felt as a character he could take about
is up

365
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,340
a plot to bypass both filters and I
eased

366
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,360
the eyes a bit a more intelligent than

367
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,000
chrome in that respect because and it
takes into account

368
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,680
and less and grab and characters

369
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,720
and then still bit xx SS even if you
inject in that within

370
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:52,250
am a script best injection so basically
what we do is

371
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,540
mean if the double courts stilted for
example

372
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,610
we jet double quote we didn't they
keyword

373
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,809
the eiffel to looks poor and then we can
bypass

374
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:07,460
the filler and these the need is an
interesting part am

375
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,970
if this is the when it include ABC

376
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,639
and before this talent section because
otherwise the job scripts

377
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:18,159
a script injection will be executed so
ship injects

378
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,710
ABC and after the single-core

379
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,730
that will bypass the job scripts

380
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,809
injection rules and so that the

381
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:30,970
parenthesis won't be the place by a hash
symbol

382
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,149
and hun that will

383
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:37,210
enable to act XQ XQ the excess specter

384
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:42,259
so the

385
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:46,119
XSS odessa is a lot easy to bypass and
then I E

386
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:54,840
in this well in this particular case

387
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,970
so you can a.m. using quotes works
within the script injections

388
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:03,350
and using course with keywords for
example JavaScript URL's

389
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,710
you can am jet quotes or injects

390
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,580
a.m. an eight characters filter to
bypass the charge kit bass rules

391
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:17,510
say some examples

392
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,190
Sophie have if a sack fillers they
process

393
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,560
and obviously up made a mistake should
be judged to live because its

394
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,300
predecessor

395
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:30,360
I'm I'm filtered book if you put the
process within the jobs Creek keyword

396
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,580
that would bypass the I Phil so if if

397
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,840
social as a separate column weakens a.m.
inject I N

398
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,100
the on their humble there and that will
bypass both filters

399
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:51,410
how'd they do work what's a special case
to script a stooge actions

400
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,430
a.m. if you put the double core

401
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,390
home within the practice this you can
bypass the

402
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:05,900
I E to access till two

403
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,960
I am so src doc a.m. dust awesome for
bypassing

404
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,310
wife's and you can use multiple levels
are decoded

405
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,640
so here we can a.m.

406
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,130
use this src doc

407
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,970
II tribute and give it a double in
caudate a.m.

408
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,010
taste smell entities that

409
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,070
credit the ashram within that's it
secured up

410
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,390
helps src docs are and then a.m.

411
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:37,380
the the action will be decoded the FAA
will be decoded

412
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,840
second time within the and src doc and
then

413
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,870
executed de TRL seen her origins and
Firefox so

414
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,800
and of every browser part from Fife
Firefox I'll

415
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,880
Firefox in II edge am

416
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,840
of in her origins and

417
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,350
we can mix you a link or adding that
page to a balanced his as well

418
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,670
because he used pacing of five entities
and

419
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:11,110
is an example so here we

420
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,220
injects at my desk URL a.m.

421
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,740
Scott have said 26 which is the
ampersand

422
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,020
an I'm which is last month's

423
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:27,480
signs well in court so they you a
recorded his dick

424
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,640
dudu encoded encoding is decoded

425
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,810
and then the haitian I and stink odin is
too cold it's a

426
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:41,440
and then that results in the ashram be
excuses so

427
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,650
a.m. nothing about you or else is that
they looked a lot like JavaScript

428
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,410
so if you look at the URL

429
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:53,150
a the hasty TP

430
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,430
part is level step in and they

431
00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:04,380
forward slash for its lush a.m. is a
comment it now he he could actually how

432
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:04,710
of

433
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,910
just a label step in for some reason
Pownal the blouses

434
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:18,130
is a syntax error so that small a job
skip tonight

435
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,200
so if we can inject new lines

436
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,510
them weekend a.m. execute the URL itself

437
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,520
because even sadder comment

438
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,830
and the new ride then the net the next
event will

439
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:37,049
will execute called so I suppose both
new lines

440
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:40,250
and line separate at lime paragraph
separate is

441
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,960
within the URL a.m. so if your URL
contains in a line or a paragraph

442
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,770
separator

443
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,980
then you can execute when and the euro
rose about

444
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,000
have credit all my supporters

445
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,179
allied separate is I made in sport

446
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:01,040
a new life Firefox you arlen Colts

447
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,270
Sox so his example

448
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:10,429
I'm location too harsh give any allied

449
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:14,600
let what and then FL document URL if
you're inside

450
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,110
a.m. nm events handler then need

451
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,299
can eliminate the doc .doc part because
I'm

452
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:24,600
within the that Hundley that document is
ashamed

453
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,260
and for state elements is a shame that

454
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,400
a hit you you looking for props in the
element

455
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,669
and that if calf I propped on the
elements he will then look at the

456
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:35,230
document

457
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,020
so when you a.m. involved URL that a lot
for

458
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:44,850
have if I'll document URL a.m.

459
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:48,370
and there's a think that's light
separator

460
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:56,810
am to works

461
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,030
and can also

462
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:01,410
a.m. if you if you've ever done a check
for hem

463
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:06,230
an external URL before slashing looking
for backslashes

464
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:10,190
you can actually inject tops with the
forward slashes

465
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,290
so and that will probably bypass love

466
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:18,510
service I caught that to such check new
lines also work

467
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:26,580
and sell

468
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,200
the window on their humbler and is
interesting way to rescue XSS

469
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,280
so we can execute without print Asus

470
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,320
I'm so when you've got

471
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,420
when US side on era

472
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:46,980
which is wen da da I on our am aside
function you can throw an exception

473
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,980
which is then executes you are called am
so that will

474
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:56,400
to let XSS unfortunately

475
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,380
a Firefox prefixes a with two words when
you fire

476
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,350
had when you do in about and book

477
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,460
chrome uses only one word am so what
happens is it

478
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,880
he says on call to something so if you
tried to install

479
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,930
and you need

480
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:18,350
so what happens is a.m. your side on
their hand

481
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,800
the entire her handler to follow
Heathrow

482
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,930
an exception you give a.m. unequal

483
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,590
and and then let and then than

484
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,850
the encoded parenthesis there and that
will

485
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,180
I'm XQ he will execute the

486
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,550
the viral XQ uncle a when court

487
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,010
equals let Wall and

488
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,850
muscle God

489
00:33:44,850 --> 00:34:01,510
and questions skin

490
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:18,280
yep

491
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,589
that the combination real techniques
really him

492
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:25,210
i'd Dave do some frozen I am a crate
a.m.

493
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:28,399
website push other dockery care which
basically you can't do

494
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,889
should footed am so basically works I
jest

495
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:35,589
performance I'm Wilshire and excess
practice

496
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:39,440
so I dawn stardom a way to automate

497
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,830
and testing as like brought a bad

498
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,929
Rossum heavier and so I can find light

499
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:48,970
the you the URL example found that he's
in fuzzy

500
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,470
and body do manual testing quite a lot
as well

501
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,960
and even and just browsing the web cam

502
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,140
and am fine in and unexplained behavior

503
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:03,800
and that should try to investigate
itself on the relative URL trick

504
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,099
and I just wanted I was injecting I'm

505
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:11,710
was injecting a website with sick access
using false lash

506
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,940
and then a call and then I wondered why
why was a CS

507
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,200
this essential disappear it and then a
look today

508
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,280
a the network and then you can say the
guess 302

509
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,180
I was wondering why would just feel to
be clearcut finest the CSS

510
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:31,119
and does so basically I discovered and
how to inject the CSS unto itself

511
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:44,970
yep

512
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,460
yet

513
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:51,140
a.m. sale

514
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,750
West to check a a.m. his you can check
your emails with an anchor

515
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,050
and then inspect the host so I am

516
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:02,060
Bassey inject some characters am so

517
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,840
injecting for such ease and then and a
character in the middle

518
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,170
and then inspect the a I corrupt

519
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:13,369
a.m. actual the anchor element and then
checked the whole state is

520
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:16,880
actually an external host so did his job
script

521
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,770
actually checks where where they you are
always play tic

522
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,890
no issues in

523
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:29,540
using the browser and specially are
using shows a

524
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:33,890
to check out ham and basically you can
name

525
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,660
you can get what you got the shells a
URL

526
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,820
you can then basically share that with
anybody and then

527
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,320
a teacher the browser's when they're
executed for people

528
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,990
will tell you which characters a over
r.i.p

529
00:36:47,990 --> 00:37:02,329
been shot cash

530
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:03,359
yes so

531
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,059
if is like a behavioral difference and
is usually a book

532
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:11,140
so if you got to browse is that do
assessing then with the browser does

533
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,950
something else

534
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:15,369
then there's usually a book that you can
exploit the Asian

535
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:25,089
you can I'm take advantage of funny

536
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:28,500
she

537
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,599
buzzes did a pretty good job the the
basically

538
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,170
a.m. much in each other's behavior and
and that helps Kuala eliminate a lot of

539
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,710
the books I find definitely

540
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,280
so if they said mushroom well

541
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,640
chrome is doing and then draft can send
behavior

542
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,099
then day will they will reduce the
amount because I can find

543
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:52,210
I'm software a good example without I am
well as

544
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,390
popper so opera a.m.

545
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,980
allowed and more properties am in the
lock a

546
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,130
an external location for an ashram am

547
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,069
Excel out more properties am one of
those properties lead

548
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:09,260
and then you could execute am X demand

549
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,369
and called and on upper am that was

550
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:16,089
if if they'd behavior and matched your
browser's we've had to put up the

551
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:16,660
ability

552
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:26,750
picture

553
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,210
know everything it will if

554
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,440
a.m. basically and any website has

555
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,710
a pretty URL and I'm so a space

556
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:40,000
peña the dotnet is for people to as
well

557
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,180
page paper the rewrite rules by any
website that pre the pretty fashion or

558
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:44,579
else

559
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:52,470
you cold

560
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:57,770
you could potentially a.m. he

561
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:02,599
at know I'm no she come fix it from

562
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,160
from a certain point you and because
even humanistic

563
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,390
you can monitor the characters here
within the past named except for the

564
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,270
direct tax

565
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,300
and the the only probably the the best
fix is to use

566
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,660
either real relative URL select forward
slash whatever

567
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:27,150
or an absolute URL

568
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:40,030
yep

569
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,450
yet

570
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:46,510
a yes so if you already have an ability
to what we'll be leading ophelia

571
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:51,490
heap

572
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,440
you could eat you could have a

573
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,160
a an RP or Venable page that has
reflected XSS is our me

574
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,420
sold within the you are he duno itself

575
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:21,910
would be encoded but that would still be
available to a popular

576
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:36,610
yet

577
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,760
I'm sign off on

578
00:40:37,760 --> 00:41:00,600
Matt will talk after maybe communiques
put it better

579
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,820
cool

580
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,560
thanks to rest thanks in

581
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,120
its
