1
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,920
you very much a llover body I apologize
for my voice it is trying to leave P I'm

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,600
trying to keep it at least for the next
forty fifty minutes

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,210
um we'll see how that goes likely have a
mic

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,410
so everything should be good and I have
a big giant bag

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,579
triple action American cough drops so

6
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:33,760
I'm set good but so let's get started

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,390
so wanna talk about how you can take
lessons from dev ops

8
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,410
apply them to your upset program cuz
fundamentally I think ap psych has to

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,540
change I think we need to have a mindset

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,570
shift a man I'm gonna talk through where
my head is with that and how I've done

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,300
that and and

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,230
both not currently appears and also I
was a the product security lead at

13
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:54,930
Rackspace

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,000
so about me five months ago I I left
Rackspace in joint pearson's absolute

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,680
group

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,750
prior to that I was at Rackspace and
prior to Rackspace I'd worked in a

17
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,670
couple different

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,759
absent consultancies doing up sick pen
testing threat modeling that kind of

19
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:10,229
thing

20
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,290
prior to that I was a I was the

21
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,890
upset guy at PA as the Texas Education
Agency author

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,450
the non the college I'm a education

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,400
agency for the state of Texas or you
have millions and millions of students

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,810
um I was also penetration tester for the
state of Texas and also taught at

25
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,680
University

26
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,900
as well as ransom IT systems for them oh
and my first

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,640
my first job out of college was it via
tell which ironically being here

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,729
um the IT operations for vehicle were in
bryan/college Station Texas which is a

29
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:47,090
tiny little town that only exist because
the university is there

30
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,950
but almost all of our business how to 95
percent of our business was in Belgium

31
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,760
the Netherlands Luxembourg France a
little bit of UK

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,409
so when I wrote about ap I got woke up
at two in the morning because somebody

33
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,010
from Belgium have woken up

34
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,180
and found out that I broke it he was
shouting at me and

35
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,470
help bill kept going to work leave me
alone ok I got it so

36
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,760
a few for what I have quality in your
life make it so that you get woken up at

37
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,959
two if you mess up

38
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,360
and you will find quality to be a very
important aspect of your programming

39
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,800
I

40
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,490
um besides my professional life I've
been involved in a low since 2008

41
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:29,430
I didn't in 2008 for summer coda lost
live CD which has morphed into of WT

42
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,730
don't he stands for web testing
environment it is a whole bunch of

43
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,020
Debian packages

44
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,930
and they have pre-configured tools in
them that you can all a card install on

45
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,410
the

46
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,570
Debbie and variant of your choice the
Bluetooth go to whatever

47
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,110
or I also produce VM's um I was on the
board of directors for a loss but a

48
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,290
whole bunch of speaking

49
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,810
at various conferences internationally
in training internationally

50
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,290
I actually haven't under graduate in
economics and a masters in MIS both from

51
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,610
Texas A&M University

52
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,810
um I actually I love the fact well

53
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,540
I like economics although I like
technology to but I think it puts a new

54
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,370
perspective having at phnom

55
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,440
technical degree behind me because it
gives me a different point of view and a

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,880
lot of times and I see things that
security people to

57
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,070
that sorta really awful incentive
structures right

58
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,900
we're gonna make this so owners are
going to hate your life but we're going

59
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,340
to take to do it anyway

60
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,010
like no let's lined up the incentives
and incentivize people to do the right

61
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,530
thing

62
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,570
we're gonna get much better results
least that's kinda my view things

63
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:35,290
so what's the problem or the problem is
particularly when I moved to Rackspace

64
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,140
the cycle time is getting crazy short I
don't know where you are now

65
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,239
I'm at Rackspace source or a statistical
out liar

66
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,090
was one product group that averaged 75
deploys per week

67
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,570
both so please tell me where no
seventy-five deploys per week my testing

68
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,290
window is

69
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,650
writer there there isn't one um

70
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,410
and if they weren't that aggressive at
Rackspace continued deployment

71
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,360
or continuous delivery was a goal anyway
I'm so into that environment if you're

72
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,600
really an agile quickly moving shop

73
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,130
the traditional part in the waterfall
where you do this one week of security

74
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:10,800
testing

75
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,590
doesn't exist and so I moved over to
Rackspace I realize like all of my sort

76
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,769
of past thinking about how I do ap psych

77
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,160
it was there was a relevant it didn't
work had to swerve

78
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,620
radically rethink what I was doing not
only that up

79
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,430
I'm but if you do try to slow down the
development work stream

80
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,689
you just gonna get stomped on by the

81
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:33,799
us because quite honestly there's a huge
first-mover advantage

82
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:37,269
particularly in the Software as a
Service world but if you're the first

83
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:39,219
one to launch the service you get a buzz
you

84
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:42,449
the hype so you are we fighting the
business perpetually

85
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,879
on your back but if you try to slow it
down so

86
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,599
you really can't in my mind slow things
down you have to understand how you can

87
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:50,549
go faster

88
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:54,079
deliver value to the business while
still getting things a secure as humanly

89
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:54,869
possible

90
00:04:54,869 --> 00:05:00,610
well or the problem oh yes

91
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,289
so I'll a traditional software has
really left of lot of time to test

92
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:04,939
anyway

93
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:08,819
back when I was it TA I saw Gantt chart
from another project managers

94
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,360
and you're following down the chart and
there was a little flights for

95
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,719
security testing at zero days why

96
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:18,879
because the schedule has been pushed and
pushed and pushed in this quest all the

97
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,979
things that the end in security testing
0 days

98
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:25,050
guess what you like that said that a
fail from planning on

99
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,489
and yet give up continues to rate all
those things there's just

100
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:32,329
it where your business is that now at
some point you will be pushed to go much

101
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:33,809
faster than your going now

102
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:38,689
um and the other thing particularly at
Rackspace with OpenStack in Python

103
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:43,469
from those are interpreted languages and
there's really no good static analysis

104
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:44,360
for Python

105
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,329
so what are you gonna do like the normal
automation you do to try to static Eliza

106
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:49,669
stuff you can even do

107
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:52,619
i three even if you could wear that
automated you cut on the back foot

108
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,300
anyway

109
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,249
and that Rackspace a lot of players Noel
there a RESTful APIs

110
00:05:57,249 --> 00:06:00,889
and there's really no good automation
tool for RESTful API as i've seen

111
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:04,399
littler no RESTful API is actually
produce a wall or I might have a chance

112
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,169
to programmatically talk to it

113
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:11,119
so what do you do right you're also
unable it's like it's all deal with all

114
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,739
over we should drink some poison

115
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:16,860
and go to sleep well not really right we
should automate all the things

116
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,009
and i wanna talk but they have of the
automation how we've done that

117
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:24,610
the Rackspace then at Pearson and just
generally what I think needs to happen

118
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,619
to make this happen

119
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:30,169
to make a application security be a much
more functional part the busiest

120
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:34,709
where we're pursuing value not just
being the throwing rocks from the edges

121
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:36,110
and screaming we're all gonna die

122
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,749
I love this quote don't get into one
form adapted build your own

123
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:43,720
let it grow be like water

124
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,530
I think ap psych has to adapt because
the software world is changing at a

125
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,620
crazy pace

126
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,970
and if we don't change a crazy pace
we're going to be left behind

127
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,640
I think we need to sort of look to our
development brother and and find out

128
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,760
what they're doing that school and works
well

129
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,150
and co-op that for us so

130
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,500
I have to stay it is definitely a time
to mourn

131
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,520
it is time to bury traditional ap psych
we had this nice week of testing

132
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,790
at the end to the development cycle that
Ted we hardly knew you were trouble

133
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,150
around all that long anyway but it's
just time to go

134
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,480
excuse me

135
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,480
so let's back up a little bit and talk
about a little bit of traditional

136
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,240
software

137
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,650
persons Devils right the old way right
very early you are very prescriptive

138
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,110
along requirements document of all the
stuff that supposed to happen

139
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,210
you had very prescriptive requirements
and design you a very long design water

140
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,090
up design documents you probably had a
waterfall process

141
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,669
I'm you working group in silos so there
was this team

142
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,160
headed off to that team headed off to a
teammate the desert on a ghost cue a

143
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,080
virtue is done it close to deployment

144
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,620
right um there's very little feedback
for loops really purposely designed at

145
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,510
least in the water for places I've been

146
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,880
and at the end you catch up a coat over
the wall said it worked on the laptop to

147
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,479
look deploying it will see later

148
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,810
right that's where the battle the way
it's a waterfall is this we've all seen

149
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,310
this

150
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,870
I think the problem with waterfalls as
you start what planet you're going to

151
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,610
fall

152
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,430
right this is my ideal waterfall I think
it shows

153
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:17,160
Tollway I I just cannot a message in a
system where you can know all the

154
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,970
requirements

155
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,720
particularly like a six-month deployment
no that you need

156
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,900
at day one ProBook 6 like that's just
silly

157
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,590
the world changes too fast so

158
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,130
to give up their answer um why did
develop come around particularly the

159
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,729
cloud companies in the world

160
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,919
they wanted high availability and very
fast introduction to features

161
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,370
and that is the polar opposite of
waterfall right that's not going to

162
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:44,840
happen

163
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,210
a waterfall because for them
particularly software as a service and

164
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,480
cloud manufacturers

165
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,510
that first mover advantage is crazy big
and it's hugely important

166
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:58,470
if you get it first you win a lot of
users on the other thing is I'm back in

167
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,280
the olden days when you ship somebody it

168
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,540
you know those things told CDs anybody
seen whether those

169
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,540
right understand why waterfall existed
you ship the product that you had to

170
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,740
finally say done

171
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,860
and put it onto a hard medium and ship
it out via mail

172
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,770
or put it in a box Philip somebody
wonderful makes sense for that

173
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,860
but Software as a Service modern cloud
computing that's a completely different

174
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,170
paradigms you can change that stuff on
the fly

175
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,640
why would you go through this law or
aren't arduous process

176
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,170
really nail things down early that need
to change late

177
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,010
um what makes a difference through
really a cultural thing it's not just

178
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,390
Jenkins RCI CD your doctor or the cool
new something

179
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,610
it's really a mindset change um

180
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,760
and it's really focusing on business
objectives at a cheap level and really

181
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,630
bring together the system the what would
traditionally be the system

182
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,850
administrators on the developers as one
group

183
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,060
that really aggressive group the track
they actually

184
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,910
every week 10 the developers were the
sysadmin hap

185
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,540
it was 5am and so while every five weeks
you were the sysadmin for that group

186
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,600
and it was shifted hat I mean you want
to talk about sharing responsibility

187
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,870
if you screw up the deploy on Friday

188
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,930
your coworkers getting on Monday new as
are all one team

189
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:18,300
to really change the dynamic right you
get this culture at like I wanna help my

190
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,250
friend with me who's part of my team

191
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,970
for excuse me a minute ever by those
people process

192
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,290
a particularly repeatability you up
stuff to be

193
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,280
push the easy button and get it done
take some work initially

194
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,940
but that means all those featured a
ploys are crazy easy um

195
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,750
and the goal was better up time and
lower operational costs right cuz if you

196
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,160
can fix the things quickly

197
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,260
you're fine a lotta cases at Rackspace
when we had stuff that kinda what's

198
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,240
clearly a lot of our

199
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,100
you know but whatever and number of web
nodes a little funky we just take all

200
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,140
the low belts rotation pop a new one

201
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,870
like we're not even get what will

202
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,000
offline diagnosed with role think but
we're not gonna try to fix it in place

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,850
would it kill it

204
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,790
and while the killing but shift of a low
Beltre pop a new one because we can do

205
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,160
that

206
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,000
order to command to have a new thing I
did too low belt reports done

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,760
right our customers never know on the
back and we can take this image others

208
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,140
BMC what's going on to buy wants health

209
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,650
the whole different mindset we're not
really fixing it for production were

210
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,529
fixing it just we have a lesson to learn

211
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:23,450
but notice that the state history

212
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,990
is most easily cracked wall bamboo or
willow survives

213
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,120
by bending with the wind as another

214
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,570
a pope for bruce Lee while quite like
from

215
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,000
really sticks with me because I think we
need to bend we've been really rigid

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,210
about we must have the absolute perfect
security my god it's not a hundred

217
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:40,730
percent

218
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,220
we're wasting our time it's just a joke
well I'm sorry

219
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,310
maybe you have to get eighty percent and
that's the best you can do

220
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,100
pathetic lot better about whining and
screaming getting nothing done

221
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,529
I think I think really need to be very
pragmatic about how we handle

222
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:55,660
application security

223
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,750
particular programs so I'm stealing the
three ways from the Phoenix project

224
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,050
if you haven't read that book a although
leave now

225
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,570
but leave later and go get it were
ordered on your phone on Amazon or

226
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,140
whatever

227
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,589
it's a fantastic book II mail I rather
think if I could live to love this guy's

228
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:14,320
life it was a

229
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,089
a great great book I'm if I was already
kinda buffet love

230
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:22,770
develops but this push me over the over
the cliff so there's three ways have

231
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,330
developed discussed in that book

232
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,860
it's a it's actually a %uh fiction a
story

233
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,300
up they take cover loved about analyst
fictional account

234
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,940
and the number one way is workflow so
workflow

235
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,480
look at what your purpose is a what prop
process adds to it like

236
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,070
what do you do for the business and what
is your process getting that done

237
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,270
and make sure that's correct from the
beginning to end and you really

238
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,880
understand it and it's smooth and well
defined

239
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,270
I'm not talking about a four
hundred-page process document

240
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,940
with three other bullets talking about
truly understanding it will not do this

241
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,720
for Pearson

242
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,020
I got an 11 so that that really large
size and paper

243
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,720
the big paper size i sat on my desk like
a pencil and a draw to workflow

244
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,089
right I didn't what three other page
document the 100 bullets

245
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,870
it doesn't have to be heavyweight you
just have to understand it and

246
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,930
conceptualize and

247
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,060
and for us that became how we sort of
talked about how we were going to do

248
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,680
things

249
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,260
so don't don't think it has to be
heavyweight then once you get the

250
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,750
process lock it down

251
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,170
in a raid on that sucker to make it
faster I'm you may hear those idea a

252
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,110
value stream

253
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,070
that is P may move the process which
provides value to the business

254
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,930
for the value string perhaps ek is
assessing applications

255
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,360
finding vulnerabilities and hopefully
preventing voter believes it for doing

256
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,079
it early enough

257
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,360
um they also talk about the divorce from
left to right or I guess

258
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,230
from left to right and left side being
the business

259
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,980
and the right side being operations in
the customer so you work from the

260
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,400
business side through to the customer
you have to serve

261
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,690
change your mindset cousin to talk with
world about this I think in the next

262
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,350
slide

263
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,020
but yet other than the next slide but
for security right your customers

264
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,600
actually the development group

265
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,620
right those are the ones in the business
you're serving

266
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,750
and then you hear the talk of well flow
is the rate at which things go through

267
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,730
your system

268
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,070
I've been doing testing for a long time
I can kinda look at a nap and go

269
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:19,450
yeah like I'll take about three days
well that's a big puncher hey rico that

270
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,390
at least a week

271
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:24,500
I can ike I've done this enough but I
know but obviously those are completely

272
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,690
on my backside

273
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,800
based on experience mind you but still
outta my backside

274
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,089
if you do it I'm gonna talk about a
couple minutes you actually have numbers

275
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:33,930
behind those and you can start making
really

276
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:38,070
interesting judgments about how you
handle contentions in your security

277
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,660
program

278
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,740
so just an example work for the ride

279
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,740
you'd write some code you committed to a
repository

280
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,579
you run some unit test

281
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:50,389
the Packers on up into a Debian rpm or
whatever your way up acting is

282
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:55,129
you do to deploy that to a test in test
environment you do integration test to

283
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:56,329
make sure everything's cool

284
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,420
you deploy to production right that's an
example workflow so what is an example

285
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,149
work

286
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:04,259
look like four application security
writing

287
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:09,019
well to me looks like this what I call
the upset pipeline

288
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:14,220
on the far side we have some request for
our sources I work internally I'm not

289
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,779
consulting right now else we've request
for our services

290
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:21,009
we have an app called back for holding
but as an estimate or even better data

291
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:22,049
tracking app

292
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:25,230
I'm we also orchestration done by stacks
form

293
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:30,049
we provision security services and we
also hand out work to people do manual

294
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:30,749
assessment

295
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:34,549
all about me at all observe automated
tools

296
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:39,529
love that feeds into thread fix but
still the correlation anti-doping for us

297
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:43,040
coming from but I have one more lie
source the plot reporting

298
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,139
and metrics we also use that to show up
stuff

299
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:50,889
and to bug trackers like juror that so
now we have a well-defined workflow

300
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:54,029
at a fairly well-known status things
flow through the system

301
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:57,629
so what are the key features a knapsack
pipeline

302
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:02,540
the biggest thing for me is it's
designed to iteratively improve

303
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,829
right I started out with a pencil
drawing on a piece of paper

304
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:10,360
that's one step up from a nap can fish
and now we have this lined out with

305
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,110
multiple servers running at Pearson

306
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,689
um I and we'll never really got be done

307
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:19,929
but we're always gonna be adding
tweaking making things a little faster

308
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,079
but on purpose

309
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,429
we didn't design has to be finished we
design is to continually be

310
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:28,709
added to and it's it's it's a mindset
change the you need to make systems that

311
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:29,899
are designed to have things

312
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:34,040
headed all a car over time because you
always have time to knock out that next

313
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,589
something

314
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:37,649
but maybe you have a slow week now you
can put that in

315
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:42,509
um provides reviews or perhaps perhaps
they can to please the flow so there's a

316
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:46,360
really calm unknown path through this
pipeline and we can cut the

317
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,410
knuckle know where you are in the system
what's the status of this engagement

318
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,179
oh what's right here we've done this in
this but not that because actually know

319
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,499
that concretely cuz we have well-defined
States

320
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:59,889
so both for our team and our
constituency the tail

321
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:03,779
p.m. group we can tell them exactly
where they are in the flow

322
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:07,360
we don't have a lot of data right now
Albert overbuilt after your so we will

323
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,610
have a really good data to know

324
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,100
not only are you here but on average it
takes as much longer to complete

325
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,659
right actually building a system the
letter say that with confidence

326
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:19,589
um does rely heavily on automation up an
almost

327
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:22,880
entirely just writing automation
routines and telemedicine

328
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,189
meta ap psych person right now I'm here
to make are upset people faster

329
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:31,580
not really do ap psych which is fine I'm
cuz we have more than enough work like

330
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,730
I'm sure you guys do

331
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,000
it's designed to grow over time and what
most importantly

332
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,139
this designed a very gracefully
interconnect with the development

333
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:41,760
process we have the various teams we
talked to

334
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,230
because you can't completely for you can
chain can't force them to change the way

335
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,940
they work

336
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,200
unless you just like fighting with
people I'm you have to figure out how

337
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,149
they work and how you can too easily
integrate with how they're working

338
00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:58,090
when a great quote from Phoenix project
and somebody else who's names alluding

339
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:03,840
spending time optimizing anything other
than the critical resources in allusion

340
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,070
and the idea here is it was a bottleneck
somewhere in your pipeline

341
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,450
if you fix things upstream to go faster
just building a bigger to

342
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,500
yes thank you like old

343
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,950
thank you for that I'll if you fix
things downstream

344
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,580
it doesn't matter the flow from that
choke point isn't to get the faster

345
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,039
you'll just have idle time

346
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:28,139
so you really have to fly with a
critical packet is in optimize their

347
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:32,250
so or the key goals for the upset
pipeline

348
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,700
well I want to optimize a critical
resource which for absecon as people

349
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,500
when there's 540 some of us here at this
conference

350
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,059
not hardly enough to cover you alone the
rest to the bloody world and I'm from

351
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:45,659
the state's

352
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:49,710
right so we're kinda hurtin for people
so we gotta figure out how

353
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,769
we optimize and make the most of the few
people we have in this business

354
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:57,269
I mean anything that doesn't require
human brain

355
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:02,019
at a great candidate optimization right
because if you can optimize you can

356
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:03,360
drive up consistency

357
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,000
if I have a junior by working for me but
I have a well-defined

358
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,760
of mostly automated process I can be
assured

359
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,610
heard that is at least meet the minimums
to find by the consistency of my

360
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,420
automation

361
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,510
write this helps you get the most out of
your junior guys make life easy for your

362
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,440
senior guys

363
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,670
I'm it helps increase work tracking we
now know where people are in status

364
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:29,020
his deep love these engagement in this
is where they're at on the hapless truck

365
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,150
flow through the system

366
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,150
and visibility and nicely into metrics
right if

367
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,910
to ask you this well I can say this
later I'll keep it for later

368
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,450
and that it does reduce the friction um
well the idea is to reduce friction

369
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:42,730
between

370
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:47,790
our teams and the a the development
teams because if we can't claim to the

371
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,310
bug tracking system and drop something
at their normal process does put issues

372
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,160
the backlog

373
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,970
we're gonna put issues in the backlog
because they were just like another book

374
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,080
granted we have a security tag we track
them but

375
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,320
from a developer portal view it's just
another normal day at the office

376
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,080
let's talk about intake some

377
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,130
so for the intake this Prof or major
classifications

378
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:14,230
an existing app a brand new app a
previously tested up

379
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:19,020
or captain 32 findings retested as risk
riverbank 4 categorizations

380
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,270
I went from those we're only gonna ask
you details about that at once

381
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,490
right the first time we see whatever
your app is

382
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,700
because we just started this in January
we're gonna ask you

383
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,250
as a project manager what it written and
what's the audience in a couple

384
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,480
questions and meta-data

385
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,600
we capture that a bagel Holden the next
time you come see us we just say hey

386
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,330
is all this talk correct I don't want
you have to fill out a twenty

387
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,150
question questionnaire every time you do
an assessment that stupid

388
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,850
on it just annoys your constituency um

389
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:55,380
yes ready for that and then we've been
um

390
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,090
adapting Uncategorized that data mostly
by using tags

391
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,500
we found a bunch of different days a
sort of slice and dice that information

392
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:02,950
using

393
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,760
arbitrary text act under those
applications that we see in its been

394
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,320
super useful in the middle of the
pipeline a

395
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,290
the story triage in Bell requests and we
decide where they're gonna go

396
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,920
okay there's gonna be a manual for spam
this is a particularly scary up it's

397
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,110
going to get the full menu

398
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,539
this is a not so scary

399
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:25,769
up its gonna get only these two
automated things from

400
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:29,309
and allows us to store all a cart offer

401
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:32,519
the different a the security activities
we have

402
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:38,379
based on risk um but they give you can
be run in parallel which is huge

403
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:42,570
for increasing speed we automate setup
and configuration

404
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,059
um as much as possible so that

405
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:50,340
for example or are setting up static
analysis we have one left the you can

406
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,070
call

407
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,859
the just set something up and post third
fix tembo

408
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:58,940
answer to a prosthetic analyzer right
that saves a ton of time and now it's

409
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,669
consistent

410
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:03,460
that things then the same in all three
systems but that kind of automation if

411
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,349
you have in place

412
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:07,409
call this and one in that and the other
in something else on the 3rd

413
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,659
also discovered that little bit of glue
code can buy you a lot up

414
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:15,379
what a momentum and we're really
focusing on

415
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:19,109
for others is me we're helping the
people the brains

416
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:23,059
focus on customizing those scans are
those activities

417
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:26,590
about the setup right we're gonna hand
you up you ideally

418
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,879
everything possible you need to start
whatever your activity is and then you

419
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:34,470
can customize a difficult situation cuz
we can automate the customization we

420
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,619
present help

421
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:40,099
insight into doing that at least not not
right now I'm so if we can give you an

422
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:41,179
easy setup

423
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:47,359
peaking at that you can spend your time
doing customization okay

424
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,419
pipeline the end so this is a source of
truth rover ap psych activities we don't

425
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:53,749
everything in the project

426
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:57,039
and so that is if we we've got to know
the state of what's going on

427
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,619
that we enter the pipeline um do indeed
oops a normalizing the findings

428
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:06,889
into one kinda universal standard but
also does

429
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:10,049
we use it to generate metrics I actually
wrote some go cold cold

430
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:14,609
PF Patrick's the youth more go cold cold
here client really original with my

431
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:15,249
name's

432
00:23:15,249 --> 00:23:18,440
I use that to generate metric ton of
traffic stopping

433
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,320
we're gonna know the status have any app
or upset program in total

434
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,529
its all in threat fix but if it's not in
thread fixes for us works but it didn't

435
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:27,109
happen

436
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:30,320
that is our source truth and they have a
nice rest

437
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,470
interface on red fixie camp almost to
the stop out

438
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:37,650
um and also that that's good for
Expendables the touch point right

439
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,110
with all of our constituency the
developers the PM's or what have you

440
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,450
it so when we're producing reports for
metrics consistent because

441
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,820
a third fix that normalization of the
various names and stuff from scanners

442
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,870
the one normalized form so what we like
upside pipelines

443
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,180
it really allows us good visibility to
work in process

444
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,390
we know what's going on at any time we
can log in to bowl and see who's worked

445
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,220
on what

446
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,240
and where they are in terms of states
and it allowed us to Scribner

447
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,710
um better optimize understand why those
choke points or

448
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,240
and that we're focusing our automation
so we focused our automation and setting

449
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,620
up the static analysis

450
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,680
early on I'm now currently focusing
light I'm

451
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,700
and automating reporting with those were
the choke points those with the pain

452
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,990
points we felt once we got stuff flowing
through the system whatever I we find

453
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,460
next

454
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,800
or to make that we just keep generating
it has greatly increased consistency

455
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,040
um it's really nice we understood
inevitably

456
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,980
the hey by the way we want you to look
at this apt question now we know who's

457
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,550
working on what we can kinda fairly al
Qaeda

458
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:45,170
like no I remember everybody is working
on it's all in bow

459
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,890
we can actually make a reasonable
judgment we can also have conversations

460
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,730
when the business

461
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,530
if you wanna drop everything at the fire
look at this apt that's fine

462
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:57,250
but here's the 10 things that are going
to happen are you cool with that

463
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,640
before we really had to do that maybe
from our memory at best

464
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,040
that we can give them concrete answers
but we fantastic

465
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,250
rescue me %uh that's a cost the
switching

466
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,280
and it's been flexible enough that
people that are senior people in her

467
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,620
junior abuse with health problems which
the portent does not look to have alt in

468
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,610
your people but we don't

469
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,720
inoperable you don't either I will stop
talking here

470
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,430
because Aaron my coworkers during a talk
with us tomorrow

471
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,400
we'll talk specifically what we did
appears and I wanted to look at this

472
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,240
high level

473
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,110
so I don't wanna steal anymore just
under that I already have we go back to

474
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,960
talking about but I love this pipeline
idea I'm hooked on it

475
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,330
I could talk for hours about a voice
okay so let's go back to work flow

476
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:45,050
making each step repeatable um in this
is to remove any sprint haphazard an ad

477
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,760
hoc work right like when I said

478
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,040
well I need to create a nap in boa need
to create an app and threats X me to

479
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
create a nap in the

480
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,930
static analyzer need to create an apple
or dynamic scanner they all have bloody

481
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,860
different names

482
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,890
right because three different people put
them in

483
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,700
of you automate that you put in one
thing that goes to all the places

484
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,290
just simple things like that can really
reduce friction in between the two

485
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:06,900
members

486
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,280
not I tend to just of well the process
once manually

487
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,090
see what's required and then run it
through a second time to make sure what

488
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,770
I think the process is correct

489
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:21,560
number for Thai automated I never look
back um

490
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,660
scripting languages are definitely a
friend if you don't know one fun when

491
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,590
you like and use it

492
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,140
i right and go cuz I like go there's
nothing magical about go of you like

493
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,380
Python or Ruby your

494
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,560
no don't care picked one that you like
right in it

495
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,040
um oh and yes

496
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,060
if you're not doing this you should
really look at the configuration

497
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,560
management

498
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,850
or small pop at Chef answerable I don't
care which one you can have religious

499
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:44,960
arguments about that

500
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,960
but the fact that you can make a
deployment consistent time in it I'm not

501
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,020
as huge

502
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,340
huge huge huge that's why I reckon we
had a no go fully

503
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,470
a one of our API endpoint we just took
it a little belts are launched a new one

504
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,530
because Washington Post poll in a script

505
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:04,220
call new node noon owed at a little
Beltre added

506
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,450
were done what happened with this guy
let's go look right now is to panic

507
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:13,120
right i cant take my time to drink
coffee a look at why that they want self

508
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,950
sorta freaking out trying to build a new
one um

509
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,990
but I would really

510
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:25,130
the highly recommend creating deployable
artifacts it recruiting Debian rpms hi

511
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:25,650
ok

512
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:29,340
what they are but Lake repeatable
deployable artifacts

513
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,660
if nothing else if your progression
version 2 if you have the old rpm you

514
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,350
can quickly get back to version 1

515
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,670
rpm remove rpm at done right as opposed
to a crap over the steps where the phone

516
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,130
book

517
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,450
credit the code I gotta check other
repository just picked it all go away

518
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,610
well makes whatever you can do you can
do for one or two hundred thousand

519
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,950
servers that's like very important

520
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,919
in your mind right noooow to one of
things need to make more people and even

521
00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:57,789
silly things

522
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:01,740
or deployment of both live automated I
created debian package that the PLO's

523
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,379
Bowl

524
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:05,740
truthfully little after we created
internally but guess what it's really

525
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,679
sticking the three

526
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,740
deployment time for both like five
minutes lot from the Revo ironical

527
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,399
scripts

528
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:15,110
ASAP over debian package apt-get update

529
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,269
done I there's no thinking it's just
made it

530
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:24,039
really really easy so making for piano
lab sec

531
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:28,460
but you're gonna be retested whatever
findings he find

532
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,440
so spend the extra 10-20 percent when
you find them to make a little script to

533
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,129
test them

534
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:37,090
not only does it make you retesting
almost instant you can hand it off to

535
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,730
the development a guess what

536
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,240
on this thing returns or the 0 instead
of a warm

537
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,869
right come talk to me cuz you probably
got it fixed

538
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:49,179
because how many times have you said hey
this is broken

539
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:52,929
go fix it they come back and say it's
fixing the retest a look well use what

540
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:54,710
affects the beat in Texas that case

541
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,249
okay they go to get in Trenton and their
a given something I can run

542
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:02,619
themselves developers to want to give
you code doesn't work but they don't

543
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:03,619
know how to test it

544
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:08,259
you can expect them to tested can little
Dakota used to do so iraq just a quick

545
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:09,769
and dirty little Python scripts

546
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:13,450
the exercise divall ability I found and
I headed into the Dept teams

547
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:17,299
roughness thing until it says yea when
it says yeah it's fixed

548
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:24,899
right done some I'll make tests easy to
understand and easy to be shared

549
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:28,809
are particularly iraq we're always
shifting people around

550
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:33,360
it was really I was almost hard to
complete an engagement could almost be

551
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,399
because we were the priorities were
changing really fast

552
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,499
so I didn't make my stuff hand-off Bowl

553
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:43,419
it made it really hard to go on to the
next engagement and keep the momentum

554
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:44,169
going

555
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:47,519
so really think about doing what you
doing in a way that you can head off

556
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,610
stupid tricks work right here okay while

557
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:54,759
gonna talk to Caracas um stupid right
works great

558
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:59,190
if you have all of your output from
tools in a particular file

559
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,580
make a zip drive although that empty
directories just F

560
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,100
every engagement the pit

561
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,260
name and the name and engagement drop
your files in there I can hand you my

562
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,030
files

563
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,950
you know where everything is I mean the
post to Pinterest like that are

564
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,809
fantastic

565
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:16,150
and make test abstraction compatible you
know what the one pic master test

566
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:21,669
1-all a car a whole bunch little pests
so I threw it up a man who has practiced

567
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:22,740
10,000

568
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,220
X what's but the man who has practiced
one kick

569
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,750
a thousand times right and that is
really key

570
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,070
like you need to be a master of the
thing that you're doing

571
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,870
another think big big thing so pick
something to get really good at it

572
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,240
never passed under X right so

573
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,100
test early and often some increased the
the rigor of your test

574
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,210
you go from left to right cuz the thing
is much more solid enough

575
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,530
so that's being developed on the for the
right you are

576
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:55,059
the more special is the but also those
replete a really important

577
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:58,400
for knapsack defects equal false
positives

578
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,960
for everyone to false-positive you
report to a developer

579
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,150
that's like a hundred real actionable
results

580
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:10,679
when you lose credit wanted crazy speed
so really be careful at Black Eyed all

581
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:11,830
the people that work for me

582
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,730
if you up on my foot in your backside
you report a false positive because

583
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,090
quite honestly you know better than
clicking next five times on Nexus

584
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,100
are Nessus that Nexus Nessus

585
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,020
bringing a PDF if you're not living
false positives like where is your value

586
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,220
as a human being

587
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,240
there is none right no false positives

588
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,190
other than obviously early is best

589
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,710
that's his main local opposition to the
global view so you can speed up

590
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,220
something if it messes up the rest to
the system

591
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,530
that the essence of this I got a 10
minute warning someone go colorfast

592
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,550
at La to content apologize um

593
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:51,980
so what's you've got that process down
this is where you start generating and

594
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,020
going faster

595
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,520
but look for steps that are manually can
be automated find those paper cut from

596
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,200
those things that annoy you were slowing
down and ought to make them

597
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,750
what is the data are missing every time
I do well up annual

598
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,540
application assessment how can I get
that and put it in for me

599
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:12,210
when I start those kinda things are
hugely important so the second one is

600
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:12,950
improved

601
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:17,200
feedback um I have an open source
project a lost custody

602
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,460
Americans 2008 I've probably had

603
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:26,160
bono 40 pizza feedback and the last time
I counted in 2009 it been downloaded

604
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,500
three hundred thousand times

605
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,430
I know my stuff is not that good and I
know it has bugs

606
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:36,130
I'm so like getting feedback is crazy
crazy crazy

607
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:40,360
valuable you need to make it really easy
for people to talk to your group to let

608
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,060
you know hey

609
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:45,140
this didn't work for me I can understand
your report what the heck does this mean

610
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,040
like you need to be very open to get
that because you're never gonna improve

611
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,010
if you don't make that simple and easy

612
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,210
a man that tell you can take that be
back into elisa maker program that much

613
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:54,700
better

614
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,820
from

615
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,080
and for you your customers are really
inside your business

616
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,240
and most importantly the customer a step
to

617
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,760
is step one right the previous step to
the coast where the prior step

618
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,740
you have to understand that you're not
only in a big pipeline

619
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,560
your actually need to present to the
next up something that's functional

620
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,930
if you do a manual test you don't put
the result in the thread X

621
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:24,630
you that work didn't happen as far as
we're concerned right you have to

622
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:29,030
complete the loop and then really
important embed the dollar's worth

623
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,750
needed

624
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,180
so if you have an automatic deploy
script like turbo

625
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,280
the documentation on how to play it is
in the source code repository with Bowl

626
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,020
live because I'm gonna ploy it a police
source code on the repository

627
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,340
right it seems like simple but he became
a star like I'll put

628
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,980
on the wiki and this other

629
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,309
within the repo when this is over there
put it all in one place

630
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:54,270
I kids but don't tricks but they make
all the difference I

631
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:58,570
I'm in a continual experimentation
learning the third

632
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,390
a way about them this is getting the
business

633
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:06,470
to embrace allowing you to fail in this
is a tough cultural

634
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,109
a lot of places but if you're not
experimenting in up finding the thing

635
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:10,750
that works

636
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:15,820
quite honestly your not funny thing that
doesn't work edison YouTube a light pole

637
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,500
supposedly tried a call he was quoted as
saying he tried

638
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,230
all the things that didn't work until he
found the one that did and I was

639
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,240
thousands

640
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:30,149
attempts to make a bloody libel right if
he was allowed to make thousands of

641
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:30,850
failures

642
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,960
up we probably still have light bulbs
but you know what I mean

643
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,310
right yell at you in a bit test fully
embrace this

644
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:42,940
um the other thing is that mastery only
comes with practice

645
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,929
so the first time we do it but first
time we deployed Bowl

646
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:51,840
it took me a day quite honestly thank
you the second time we deployed Bowl

647
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,149
it took me an hour the third time it
took me 15 minutes

648
00:34:55,149 --> 00:35:00,020
and now it's five right so don't expect
my son is terrible about this pasta try

649
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,350
something the first time to expect is
awesome I like

650
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,350
kid you're not gonna be awesome you need
to do what about a thousand times and

651
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,060
then guess what you'll start to be
awesome

652
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,930
but realize that you're the first time
you gonna do this is gonna be slow the

653
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,470
second time it will be faster

654
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,300
so I'm gonna talk but experimentations
I'm gonna various places that I found

655
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,090
useful

656
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:23,330
hopefully will be useful to you so
findings directly in the bug trackers

657
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:27,510
no paint tester consultant likes
reporting well I don't think anybody

658
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,340
likes reporting

659
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,119
um than in most other places I've been
able to work I've been able to

660
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:37,400
of link caught off a PDF and drop stuff
directly in issue trackers

661
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,190
because I was the where they gonna look
the developers the PM's are going to a

662
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,320
commission tracker

663
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,790
know what a reader jar PDF not only that
you put in issue tracker sensibly

664
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:51,390
they can break up that one big
engagement up and number findings and

665
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,539
individual concrete work if you're at
all shot that ought to be work anyway

666
00:35:55,539 --> 00:35:59,170
you to save the PM the time abandoning
all that crap into the backlog anyway

667
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,220
you just made a friend

668
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:07,099
film early editions approve an
overworked oh we use project to do this

669
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:10,490
I'll if you happen if you have a bug
tracker

670
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:14,410
you get bonus points if it is an API but
you will definitely need a security

671
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,980
categories you can distinguish her books
from others

672
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,089
offer the resident nag nag nag

673
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:24,640
so for each in this the really crucial
mindset different

674
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,730
for each severity a finding that we have

675
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:32,099
we have an SL way the FAA is not to have
it fixed

676
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:35,140
not to have it fixed is to have

677
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,410
a mitigation plan in place because quite
honestly

678
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:42,700
a lot of all abilities that you find
test you have no idea what work

679
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,460
I i've a rough guess cuz I've done this
awhile honestly don't know what it's

680
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,150
gonna take

681
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:51,680
so let's get together and if we have a
critical we have 24 hours to get

682
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,380
together

683
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,089
and have a meeting of the minds and
understand that by this date that I can

684
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,109
now put into a calendar and hold you to

685
00:36:58,109 --> 00:37:02,519
you will have it fixed but it allows
equal footing for both

686
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:06,920
us the PM's on the dev team's to discuss
how we're going to get this thing done

687
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,019
because we have to agree on the San
arbitrarily deciding that a critical

688
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:10,569
text

689
00:37:10,569 --> 00:37:15,579
three days who the whole follows if they
have to re architect the whole thing

690
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:19,380
I could be six months right so don't
make this

691
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,539
Leiby days to get fixed picket days have
a mitigation plan in place

692
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:27,220
was a huge culture change for me and it
really helped and

693
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,990
and the age-old the findings based on
that as a lay and then we start

694
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,500
reminding people politely

695
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,980
hey you got seven days on your victims
we need a we need to take

696
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,980
and if they don't talk we start walking
up to or chart

697
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,440
getting to the director and Rackspace
the case the head of product

698
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,569
these teams have these outstanding all
abilities they won't even talk to us

699
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:47,660
about getting them fixed

700
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,730
and that UW men's reply and make
management is cool with this

701
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,180
it started back to war if you don't but

702
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,349
you'll actually really started
attracting initials X

703
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:01,920
but amazingly help well the group but
dealt with the track we had in our

704
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,030
meeting schedule cuz that's just the
block user

705
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,560
Angela min 20 Minister like that's what
you gonna do that today okay we're done

706
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,040
see later have remains back in your life
on but we'd be listed directly talk

707
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,300
about how we get this fixed

708
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:18,630
well as your pictures good anti-peace
and I'm okay with that perfect no reason

709
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:18,930
to get

710
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,320
excited about it um bonus points if you
can put it on the dashboard

711
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,520
because then you get this iSuppli this
came all the time iraq

712
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,900
Chi the cloud database product out there
to fix the water was taking you guys

713
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,370
club I'll solo

714
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,920
haha you look at those private things
going bull

715
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,130
stuff get fixed automating
infrastructure talked about this earlier

716
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,370
stuff papa danceable these are
declarative languages

717
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:47,010
you can write and ask for script or a
program to the back a deployment

718
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:51,120
you can checked into source code a
conversion it right is a fantastic

719
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,710
things

720
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,730
so here's an example of Realtors close

721
00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:00,310
how to install something somewhere but
this is methods to where you can bundle

722
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,680
up installation urging

723
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,900
set-ups for various servers right this
is a place because a security for

724
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,540
specials

725
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,750
a lot on your cycles because if you can
prove but automated deployment is

726
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,420
hardened

727
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,920
guess what I don't care large water or
fifty of them

728
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,690
cuz are all the same and they're all
hard and so the work I did you get that

729
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,530
one harden

730
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:23,830
is now repeated every time you do a
deploy this is a huge huge huge

731
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,170
productivity gain

732
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:28,860
if you can get there we did the racket
was fantastic

733
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:33,670
um know if you are a good call a point
merge those past substrate because you

734
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,990
can download these recipes cookbooks
what have you

735
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:39,330
from internet and those are usually
quite honestly security crap

736
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:43,130
because I just get it working that'll
actually harm anything so good karma

737
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,200
points make a hardened

738
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,330
engine X not just get into next and the
other thing with these configuration

739
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,220
management tools

740
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:54,640
okay again 0 minutes ago really quick is
that they have tags

741
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,730
and you can apply requirements those tax
so in this case I have a

742
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,890
the cast service kit monitoring mmmm
cash

743
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,900
database kit monitoring and nice people

744
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,600
you can actually make a security
requirements based on the pegs all

745
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,470
databases must do these things

746
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,890
all servers period must allow root login

747
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:18,180
but those are the kind of things you can
do with the formation

748
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,539
inspector you need one

749
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:23,789
saw a post appointment book the goes
back and verifies it was kind of picked

750
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:24,750
up with the idea

751
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:28,569
you have an architect who designed the
building have a builder that build

752
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:32,430
many of the building inspector come then
make sure everything's cool

753
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,660
so we have to post war that hook that
would go to a quick scan

754
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,940
above the deployment and make sure they
were kosher right there is a huge way

755
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,960
to get um to get

756
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,049
the visibility into those supplements
know what's going on

757
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:50,480
you can also use linus which is a cheap
ill open source project

758
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,210
it's a whole big bunch a message script
to do hard things checks

759
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,710
this fantastic because the you know the
defendant is our

760
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:01,010
bash like show me a Linux to doesn't
have bash

761
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,760
hike painted be dropping your aunt or
you run it

762
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,869
done I'm agent you really need one of
these

763
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:13,500
%uh mitterand if you wanna so it is said
it's a read-only agent

764
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,020
that just looks for the configuration of
the system in reports that's the

765
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,410
configuration state back to the
mothership if you really want to do this

766
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,650
but you have a policy

767
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:25,579
and then you can enforce the policy now
if there's like back a couple years ago

768
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:27,520
when Jenkins at the pub owner Billy

769
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,490
you can have your mole tell you
everybody was Jenkins and what version

770
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,180
it is

771
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,690
when you can go those teams and get it
done the good writeup on the border

772
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:39,960
sure all the red Jenkins and watch them
turn green

773
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,960
but that's a huge thing clout passage is
a commercial product

774
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,789
possess muzzle america's an open source
product does something like this

775
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:50,460
but even if you write your own little
bit uptight or what have you it's super

776
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,440
crazy handy

777
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,819
up yes this is the last one

778
00:41:54,819 --> 00:41:59,710
pretty well abilities and its head so
instead of doing the normal scan report

779
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:03,240
go fix soap star subscribing to all the
in now

780
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,680
lists or the security lists for the
whatever lists

781
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,039
for the products that are Katie or
perhaps and

782
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:12,970
not are you getting equal the comes in
that says hey there's really a problem

783
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,910
in Tomcat

784
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,010
now you're going to the dev team full of
him saying hey

785
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,329
there's a bad problem in Tomcat how are
we going to get this done

786
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:23,890
not I'm gonna wait six months until the
quick release can happen

787
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,570
I want to a scanner on a freak out his
talk has been out-of-date for six months

788
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:32,060
but is completely turn things round up
having a nice calm conversation but how

789
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,690
we can get this updated its not like

790
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:38,120
who got the world's gonna end has been
vulnerable for how long um

791
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,610
I honestly use Gmail's in some
commercial tears and that worked rather

792
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,720
well for me when I had nobody to do this

793
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,840
there's also a protocol security
available

794
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,920
are the tests for you from commercially
but it's really nice to be able to

795
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,930
proactively approached

796
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:55,570
of seems to say hey we got this problem
let's figure it out I just I just heard

797
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,470
about it today

798
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:01,300
as opposed to like oh god we've been
volatile from month rescues mickey take

799
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:01,800
place

800
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,510
of them a try to look for a paper cuts
and fix those things first

801
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:09,270
because if nothing else we all have to
work we ought we ought to enjoy it

802
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,250
so if you can fix the paper cuts to make
you hate life life will be a lot better

803
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:13,850
for you

804
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:19,120
almond find out your work alright make
your own ap psych pipeline up here for

805
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,230
looks like what we did

806
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,990
but you really need to understand that
workflow and start getting some tooling

807
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:25,780
around a couple really speed up

808
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,500
their systems and crucially make things
designed to be

809
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,020
a home grown organically right you're
never fully done you're always

810
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,660
adding things to make it a little bit
better and just as a as a

811
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,280
as an industry we have to be a lot
better with accepting

812
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,830
kind of testing standards are you must
be this high to ride the ride

813
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:47,260
not your perfect because a lot of the
stuff I end up doing it right there was

814
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,200
fully automated

815
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,720
was you must be this high to ride the
ride you pass the smell test

816
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,570
I don't know if you're really rugged but
at least I know you're not a basket case

817
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,650
right and that's something you can do in
an automated fashion and if you don't

818
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,520
but start learning talked up

819
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,010
because that's your gonna talk to you
get a lot more credit points BC Health

820
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,070
call using CIT with Jenkins

821
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:11,160
I got ants will script that sweet right
if you can talk to have your in a way

822
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,920
better place

823
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,970
I love both for these books are
fantastic read

824
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:18,490
I would highly highly highly highly
recommend to get the Phoenix project can

825
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:19,000
read it

826
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,180
the other one is fantastic if you do
incall operations and

827
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,849
questions

828
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:28,380
if I have any time we have 15 seconds

829
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:34,290
any really quick questions yes sir are
you at work in the garden

830
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:38,450
not currently but it is in our roadmap
we're not to that point yet

831
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:42,510
us their pipeline the next step for us
is gonna be doing a lot of that baseline

832
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,339
security

833
00:44:43,339 --> 00:44:46,940
scanning work and that's where that will
use call that'll probably be

834
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,990
August ish when we get there I would
guess okay

835
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:54,280
thank you very much myron this on the
par-5 Voice Minutes

836
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:04,040
30 well sorry for five minutes a switch
rooms if you want to go
