1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,440
to talk about the top 10 web hacking
techniques a 2014

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,910
everyone a

3
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,800
I mean you've seen a version of this
talk before thought they were

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,480
producers you don't know you were
articles

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,540
so a because you don't know either bus
we

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,860
a matter hinton and the newseum Michael

7
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,690
yeah we're good I'm so a matter it soon
I'm

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,829
directors your service is over whitehat
security

9
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,300
I'm Jonathan I'm a manager for the
research center

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,260
my head up are you operations in the UK
shorter flights

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,910
yes more lively is underway so because
you haven't seen this before

12
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,210
on inaudible clicker thing you know
you're so

13
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,019
good just in with taxes you pay homage
to you

14
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:04,129
I just a crazy amount of wave
application research that goes on

15
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,820
throughout the year just turned you know
squishy 21 talk

16
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,460
most things better on our on our list

17
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,970
are have their own hour-long talk a

18
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,160
is a new in this room that has something
on this list you know about between us

19
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,650
to use

20
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,810
some other people on this list there
from you so weapon or no

21
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,310
article what is your name you don't know
on this list for something

22
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,369
work about years for

23
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:32,740
you know doctor a we've been doing this
every year for about

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,250
a nine years or so so on this is the
kennedy

25
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,850
away where a for

26
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,000
and for to

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,580
how this works me take submissions from
the community

28
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,630
for you know best new research
techniques

29
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,920
year right opening wat

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm here you know anywhere from you
alone your last year

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,550
130 see total submissions

32
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,720
and what happens then is there's a
Nouveau

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,820
back a narrows that down to top 50

34
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,160
and we take top 50 I love three experts
like Troy

35
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,860
was just duty you know his honor here
and

36
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,060
panel expert now is that 15 down to list

37
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,200
top ten Alps resort in tone

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,730
right so we can see if I whose names
have

39
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,980
attack whether techniques a

40
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,760
for use in we cease we've heard taking
over there

41
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,140
things lot every year with you know he
pours

42
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,290
him crime

43
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,320
I am in last year mutation XSS a

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,850
takeover top slot for by merrier talk
later today

45
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,170
K yes access their

46
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,019
top spot again but three top five worst
on corruption-related so people still

47
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:54,910
really like incursion

48
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,920
I so without further ado I guess

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,230
make things up it

50
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,510
same here

51
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,490
on better okay cool

52
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,490
better sorry a

53
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,800
to a no further ado I guess right here's
the

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,120
the the top 10 if this year creditors
purchase King again

55
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,700
right helping any research surprise that
sharply take number one heroes

56
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,250
a it was probably the most echo chamber
escaping

57
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,870
web ap thing to happen in the last
decade

58
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,600
right I you know you know it's bad when
like your parents are calling you and

59
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,380
saying hey should I be worried about
this I saw it on the news right that's a

60
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,440
matter you know okay

61
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,230
something serious going on right and so
based on a review is

62
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,630
we have nowhere near enough time in 45
years

63
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,750
talk about I'll tell if these so we're
going to try to give you the

64
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,700
right just a fly through love I 10 36
and they're kinda deep dive into you

65
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,900
top 5 will be more pressure cool so
starting the return we have

66
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,580
covert timing channels now cover time
channels essentially a side-channel

67
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,260
attack

68
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,310
or a timing attack where the measuring
up how long it takes in the process

69
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,230
instructions

70
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,600
may provide what issues are within
privileged information this particular

71
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,640
research

72
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,970
I was covering various issue to be cash
others the time that was required to

73
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,480
infer

74
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,829
data were either cash non-cash so they
look at the last modified in the tag

75
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,860
response headers request headers
denounces

76
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,830
online if one fights and stuff on
modified since this magic non-merch

77
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,970
and a strange on one heavy math going on
here but they made our top 10 list

78
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,620
that was actually the interesting thing
about number 10 those the first time we

79
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,280
ever saw someone campaign to try to get
onto

80
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,750
are but unless they actually put on
slide deck on slide scared said

81
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,440
this is why you should vote for us to do
without them once they get to work

82
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,380
together

83
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,900
so I number nine this ones kinda
interesting case it was

84
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,850
you know the distribute down service
isn't exactly new technique prep but the

85
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,280
avenue of attack was certainly unique I
this researcher actually was able to put

86
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,910
the

87
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,180
the DoS attack with in facebook notes
like the Notes application part

88
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,330
Facebook there a largely should be get
flood so the dust jacket actually

89
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,470
originating from facebook da cops those
pretty interesting

90
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,500
number eight we have a remote code
execution for strikes to you

91
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,410
as a nice dress is your day resulting in
the manipulation of the class loader

92
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,530
and it being able to like this with
public execution

93
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,300
so what you do is you would pass the
class to class loader commands

94
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,900
as a parameter to add on action resource
and then

95
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,169
pretty much it would run whatever could
you want to so

96
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:35,740
funny thing about this is that the
original six was to you

97
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,940
cinderblock class to class loader over
you can convert that to you

98
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,009
bracket notation easily bypass the first
one to fix that

99
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,430
and then again they weren't checking
case sensitivity

100
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,760
so class be da class later portion can
be lowered his ERA Perkasie

101
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,310
so once again the lebanese back open
back up again um

102
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,740
eventually this text and read at the
bottom is what needed to be added to the

103
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,510
exclude grams portion stress to you

104
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,680
in order to you to sleep excitability
this guy got

105
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,889
I think three total CDs are able to get
to see the

106
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:09,250
every time they fixed it but not good
enough for many resubmit it was a new CV

107
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,259
any reason that it got a new CD the
three CDs in the same bug repellents

108
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,139
that was pretty cool

109
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:17,990
arts number seven Google to factor of
bypass this one was kinda just

110
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,410
this this was another unique when the
middle is this yours is an attribute it

111
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,430
to anyone

112
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,930
actual researcher at this is Anonymous
hacker rate but this one again made the

113
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,370
made the news in time and I we you know
we decided to

114
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,949
to still let a qualified to be on the
list and I'm glad we did because I got

115
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:34,389
voted

116
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:38,210
you know pretty high up as this was just
an overall

117
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,760
the man we saw these two factor of
bypasses more

118
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,940
I you know this SJ uptick in the past
year

119
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,240
specifically targeting people like
journalists who were starting to use to

120
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,510
factor of which is of course

121
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,870
a great thing right you know finally our
we're getting journalists to

122
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,380
used you for dropping their social media
accounts things like that but we also

123
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,550
saw them get

124
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,990
you know bit pretty hard if they were
able to bypass and

125
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,250
the one that actually the post that
stirred up a bunch in

126
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,530
had an article in Wired knows her stuff
but was the reason that made the list

127
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,099
was

128
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:12,330
on the bypass is actually through the
cell phone

129
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,629
carrier providers they're actually
social engineer your call the cell phone

130
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:16,289
provider

131
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:19,780
and social engineer their way into you I
adding a

132
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,919
call forwarding and text forwarding
number to the account and so

133
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,110
I if they were using tax sms-based to
factor of

134
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,199
and there were some sort of SMS
forwarding going on they were able to

135
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,400
to steal the token bypassed so

136
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,490
number six attacking people against one
click this is essentially

137
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,189
a just a qualified ceaser and I'm really
happy to sit on it is the first time

138
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:43,629
that a bug bounty one single but money
is made our list

139
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,990
typically the new hacking methodologies
but the songs it's really cool

140
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,310
because I'm basically we got Charlie
found here is that when making a

141
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,009
authenticated request to pay pal and
stripping the

142
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,159
such an credentials or a authentication
tokens

143
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:01,169
you be redirected to a warning page okay
now

144
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:04,620
Cesar protection was in place for this
particular app however they're not

145
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,520
regenerating

146
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,560
Cesar tokens so what you had it once you
have it for that particular user

147
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,589
we found is that if you put in a victims
email address

148
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:17,210
so you have a nude pic and email address
the targeted attack any false password

149
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,979
submit the form in the response the
ceasar token that was generated was not

150
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,830
associated to that particular account

151
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,110
so what you have that one token then
everything within the constraints at

152
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,289
Caesars are applicable in this changes
along with same token because the app

153
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:32,579
was not regenerating it

154
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:36,269
um this is because the person I've ever
seen a way for you to like

155
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:40,229
the session to the this is our cooking
was tied with your account with

156
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:40,899
YOURUSERNAME

157
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:44,089
for some reason the reasons think um

158
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:47,230
and they ordered him a ten thousand
dollar

159
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,480
by many for the some really busy but
many make this top 10 list about

160
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,570
Benihana myself so

161
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,990
pierce the sky yeah that that's user

162
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,680
doing what you do absolutely anything to
let people carry itself

163
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,699
research project okay number five really
get to the

164
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:06,459
detect here I so as did anyone here but
this one didn't see this talk

165
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,500
the last year this misfortune cookie
research

166
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,070
to some because research this is
probably my favorite wanna last so

167
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,709
given no its not number one this is this
was close to my heart so

168
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:19,710
I these researchers were able to

169
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,940
to I actually attacked residential
gateway routers

170
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,490
a with a single HTTP request and the way
they went about his recall if you're

171
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,030
interested I'm gonna give you a rundown

172
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,920
if you're interested go watch the full
talking about the best talk but I saw

173
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,560
last year

174
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,720
on up here did sorry so

175
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,500
the just a little bit background what
you need to know to actually understand

176
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,470
this attack

177
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,560
these are things that I don't really
have a full grasp on I also have you

178
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,460
heard in this city are 69

179
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,630
this was new to me yeah it's new to most
to do to you few

180
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,000
okay so I what this is this came out
this

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,400
the this is the protocol misused or
abused you know they're

182
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,880
a which it came out in 2004

183
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,980
and and really what this I is is the

184
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,550
I is also known as the CPE way and
management protocol

185
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,890
right so CPE is consumer premises
equipment right so this is how

186
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,990
your Internet Service Providers are I

187
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,510
accessing your home routers and doing
something right ever call your ISP

188
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,860
and say hey something's not working at
all so in a sense answer to reset

189
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,890
Odin you know it power cycles your
device at home

190
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,910
this is the protocols being used their
right so these researchers with that

191
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,320
said hey that seems

192
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,530
it seems pretty powerful read the
there's a lot of power

193
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,720
going on with the ice the hazards
control your device in your per

194
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,780
Prem right so what's going on here and
so what is going on is there's

195
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,930
this auto configuration server as ACS
server

196
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,070
that the ice teas used to have some
semblance a

197
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,750
you know do authentication meaning you
know the ISP knows that you're actually

198
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,620
the consumer that started talking to
consumer knows that

199
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,680
you're actually I speeders trying to
talk to you in there some yes a

200
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,170
back-and-forth communication there

201
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,780
on but like I said this was written in
2004 and

202
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,600
this protocol actually just uses I so
RTC

203
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,710
which is just acceleration EP ratso

204
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,380
a you know this is when hackers dream
rate okay cool so to see a chippy

205
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,770
it's got control over the home router I
okay and

206
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,620
this ACS's the all powerful device that
we're going to worry about right so

207
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,230
a look at this said that's a single
point of failure I'm going to focus on

208
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,460
listed do my research track so it did a
little digging

209
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,940
and the notice that this protocol uses
port a

210
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,280
7547 an do is more digging

211
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,010
and I looking at research from I think
this is University of Michigan

212
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,080
when they scan the entire internet this
port is actually the second most common

213
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,330
port open on the entire

214
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,830
entered besides course eighty rate and
so

215
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:54,310
you know cases widely prevalent there's
no single point of failure again this

216
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,950
the stream just keep getting better

217
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,960
I so that this was the

218
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,250
this was a scan about 2.8 1,000,000

219
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,590
devices is this an okay peace
extrapolate this over crossed

220
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:10,080
you know this number for consumers is
correct for the entire internet I have

221
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,990
the actually didn't have to assume
because rapid7 actually did a scan the

222
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,850
entire internet

223
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,690
I later after they started the research
and the numbers actually worse than this

224
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,510
is 1.18 percent

225
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,410
so 46 million I had two devices

226
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,720
at this port open okay so what's on the
sport was running on a sport

227
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,400
so this is a breakdown a the technology

228
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,860
running on this open port that is open
on you know 1.18 percent of the entire

229
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,490
internet

230
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,470
I and so again as as researchers were
you noted on

231
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,880
yet big choke up I over there I
rampaging

232
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,240
so fifty percent love these open ports
were running Ron Peters

233
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,560
I've done a little bit deeper said okay
what

234
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,820
versions a rampage or are there what you
know what kinda person to this code do I

235
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,400
need to act on an ordered if I want to
take advantage

236
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,850
summers of our her death at ninety the

237
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,020
plus per se above the ROM pager

238
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,490
versions that are out there for all
running the same version and want to get

239
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:10,900
away

240
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,290
year that version was written don't
wanna

241
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,000
no Thad be a dispirited 1980

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,400
a know is actually two doesn't even a

243
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,180
so their really up to date version of
the software was roughly seven versions

244
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,870
behind

245
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,080
am's you know ninety-eight percent

246
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,580
back 52 percent love one

247
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,930
percent in June percentages backs up to
ten devices

248
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,000
a running the same version that's old
version

249
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,520
love rounded so it's gonna operated rats
that's kinda the breakdown of

250
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,520
what's going on why we care so a

251
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,640
this from pager version you on router
firmware

252
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,920
I these researchers the Sighthill expose
the stuff this specific version is it

253
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,090
everywhere

254
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,550
I you pretty quickly they were able to
cross the router

255
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,450
right page with Sony should be headed by
using the added the Authorization header

256
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,530
I near Cooper quick guide issues new
browner and 600 ace

257
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,279
and

258
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:17,079
in their router crashed the problem was
that there was no debug interface

259
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:20,970
for this router whatsoever so they can
really get a core dump in

260
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,259
kinda you do all the cool things this
area figure out what can overflow

261
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:25,459
situation they had

262
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:29,360
right but offers you familiar with this
kind of research this is the

263
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,569
bit ago was notable there unprotected
stream copy

264
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:35,579
a surged that their for a quick so

265
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:39,050
on this is I this is brother cause
partners talk

266
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,709
%uh these guys gave I'm since there was
no debugger available

267
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:46,589
that they couldn't get the cord open
couldn't figure out what they did to

268
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:47,670
crash the router

269
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,519
they actually opened up the router and
soldered into the motherboard and then

270
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,740
wrote their own debugger

271
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,970
which is the most accurate thing I've
ever heard a

272
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,939
which is awesome and then a on to make
even more awesome than a bit short on

273
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:04,970
freebie Power Ranger fairness I a bit
support document their record stands for

274
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,410
but it is called the answer

275
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,740
a so this is what they're the open their
debugger

276
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,939
once they crashed the router is what it
looked like and here you can see

277
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:15,089
instruction pointer up

278
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:18,259
top and be really okay when it's over at
the instruction pointer it is nasty

279
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,370
sectors router

280
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,019
I problem was this wasn't reliably

281
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:27,620
a exploded all over the internet because
even though it was the same Bergeron P

282
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,699
do so prevalent

283
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:32,649
a the memory stacks depending on which
firmware

284
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,550
was using which devices using I was a
lil bit different so you can reliably

285
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,720
exploit this

286
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,120
you know this exact point memory that
you would need so they had to take a

287
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
little bit further

288
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,860
I well run Peter happens to use cookies
a

289
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,910
near for infinite valuable reasons

290
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,079
pro so but the the way that there there
could be either way it out

291
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,160
a is is pretty interesting so they have
a pre allocated

292
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,230
you know namespace it's really just c0
c1 c2

293
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,149
whatever and that array is actually
pretty allocated memory

294
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:09,990
snow across devices they don't need to
worry about the different memories to

295
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,459
is this this terrific is reallocated to
know exactly where it goes

296
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:15,620
I in the infinite wisdom

297
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,250
around pager the the corner memory that
was

298
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,580
what was used was just strip the sea

299
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,860
of Albuquerque it's certainly a $50,000
that was the border 0

300
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,630
right cool I so that made it into the z4

301
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,890
these ghost few to just the you know
rights in which is confusing

302
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,020
completely just remote code execution
always right

303
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,920
so your speech on the bottom with just a
benign example

304
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,660
rights if you just change the name to
the beach is Ian and whatever you want

305
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,060
the instruction pointer to be

306
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,040
on better start report urges change in
happened to you

307
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,770
oh my god the tax right to substitute
past few when you're trying to be a few

308
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,200
something

309
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,529
an average is redirect the browser to
you this

310
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:02,779
you know the slash whatever it so this
was the only

311
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:06,480
and start reporter that actually put in
their talk

312
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,010
I think because the other ones are too
scary I'll

313
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,110
on stage they didn't show the actual
array of cookies to be used

314
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,559
but I just with setting it was three
cookies

315
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:21,339
there ever completely bypass
authentication the router

316
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,059
could flash the firmware if they wanted
to do whatever the heck they wanna

317
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:24,420
rights

318
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,569
so again this is from residential
gateway routers this owned

319
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:30,670
all the computers behind a you know the
tire neighborhood

320
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,820
I think their ways 189 countries in some
countries over half

321
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,410
the IP addresses were gonna put the
Bears so it was not a small bug

322
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,860
I'll and this is usually the slide rice
A

323
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,980
and here's the world warm and fuzzy part
of why shouldn't be worried but this one

324
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,220
I don't have a warm and fuzzy I'm sorry
I were fuzzy for this room is you can

325
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,809
if you're using a mobile device you can
flasher firmware frightened people in

326
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:56,320
this room probably can't figure out how
to flash the firmware

327
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,059
but a don't give you know ground on my
phone number when you tried ur

328
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:05,760
water three flashing her firmware or and
I'm not to hold my breath for my ISP

329
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,059
updates any of their advice is that they
have throughout a

330
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,670
your residence where is this was kinda
scary but this geyser

331
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,509
maintaining a list

332
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:17,460
viable devices there for want to check
it out

333
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,809
okay it's moving on before we have the
Rosetta flashtool

334
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,799
this mean a lot headlines last year is
anyone familiar with this money chance

335
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,239
her to present a flush

336
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:32,809
couple people school is he in the room
yeah it is

337
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:37,960
good fantastic so he's got a much more
in-depth talk about this I believe that

338
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,719
1530

339
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,289
today yes a deadly got into the deep
dive we're not gonna do it just as much

340
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,299
a skimming over it

341
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:46,570
a.m. congrat yeah that being said

342
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:51,289
a so what this is the tool that he
created to convert to binary swift into

343
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:53,469
a non alphanumeric swift they can then

344
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:57,229
be executed on a target them inside
using Jason P so

345
00:18:57,229 --> 00:19:00,419
two things that are there will have with
no interruptions

346
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,849
yet the I as you have some binders worth

347
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:08,200
every instance like minor garbage before
and

348
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,919
is tall essentially users have been
going to you act as a result is some to

349
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,879
translate that information into

350
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:17,779
readable alphanumeric text is awesome to
the jason B

351
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:20,769
so many hackers and I'm like I can
around the Zags on the response came

352
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:21,719
back with a call back

353
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:25,700
yes was it all over the place so Jason
px thats X

354
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,940
that accepts a call that parameter a
value berkes

355
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,159
it is the largest cities even underscore
any period so although there's a little

356
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:33,789
bit but

357
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:36,919
in the collision place you can't as a
binary and but because I was looking at

358
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:37,389
work

359
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:41,529
but if we take this with file and
converted to you just alphanumeric ce

360
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:45,499
with those allowed character sets we can
foresee some P to execute the Swiss as a

361
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:47,139
toasted on a target domain

362
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:50,539
now just a couple sites for using this
or are using this

363
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:53,739
Google Yahoo LinkedIn and Twitter get
your

364
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:56,830
and was a Google it's not like some
third-party acquisitions

365
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,070
acquire two months ago its dub dub dub
Dubble accounts like Google Maps I cool

366
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,330
like all the duties of

367
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,330
so here we have just

368
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,399
brief overview again love the research
is going to later arms a minor breakdown

369
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:10,619
among us with better

370
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:14,619
now here we've gotten impressed with the
liberal press and hold him a compressed

371
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:15,109
worse

372
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:18,639
for the purpose of this research we're
just gonna purpose per are focus on the

373
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:19,809
New Zealand compressor

374
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:23,399
is due to the fact that he was able to
brute force the other 30 to check some

375
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:26,010
into the data the verify the integrity
that

376
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,420
you love data section the almost over
the magic by to you the term which

377
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,090
version is

378
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,120
then version following and then breakup
a

379
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,890
depending on which typeof congressional
no russian issues after that

380
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,890
so result of what has been used and that
I could make you took encoders

381
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,590
in order to map non-oil bites to you
about it because we have a lot more

382
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,180
in the character set binary trash if you
will

383
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,230
then just other numerics with a special
characters so

384
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,410
not I'm going all the talking with you
will he doesn't

385
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,920
sadly but the Waste King dollar girl
characters for the first few bites here

386
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,460
as well as the other thing to check some
is cannibals in the matter he does it

387
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,220
ties into you

388
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,310
1530 yeah with a again

389
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:11,330
this is the pic on to be generated so
just small ActionScript right there left

390
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,090
this is how would convert into bombing
of an American version

391
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,460
and then you can exploit that put into
this right here

392
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,630
comes with bosnian bedded on an attacker
control domain

393
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,330
using the content-type content type
forcing object tag so you can see the

394
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,640
rainfall mobile doc on

395
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,150
in the attribute value for data and then
down there the bottom

396
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,600
in the preamble use for flashvars we
have people will say the words i cant

397
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,060
use the chase on the call back

398
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,610
as well as attacker host are supplied

399
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,740
resource if you will to log data the
money trail through it

400
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,890
now medications for us

401
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:49,130
one you could just not used it will be
at all or sandbox that particular

402
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,180
information of

403
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,820
on to the weekend with headers a we can
take on the disposition

404
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,640
attachment file name: which is going to
then don't know that's what phone

405
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,470
surrender at

406
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,010
under in the browser you can also change
X button type options

407
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:04,320
know stuff or at rather because then I'm

408
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,330
as long as the response center doesn't
come back with a shockwave flash

409
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,420
you're looking to go after changes on
application

410
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,420
a JavaScript then it's not going to fire

411
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,690
as belted swift also

412
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,560
the quick-fix if you will it's just sad
the block comments section daniel green

413
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,180
text

414
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,640
from the call back images on is what
Google's would get a Twitter all they

415
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,510
were doing to you

416
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,640
remediate this very simply so if you're
actually I can around the scene is now

417
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,810
in a comic responses

418
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,890
then that's basically what's coming from
it's a defense to reserve

419
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,150
attack is that in your that still your
Twitter via

420
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,240
slash thirst for success but for
Southern Miss Twitter bio

421
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,570
for for a while yeah China's

422
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,840
its that's fair there okay cool

423
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,070
so yeah we we flew through the actresses
here

424
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,750
you can SC that occurred the bladder so

425
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,120
okay number three we have put also this
was the

426
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,810
the year the branded vulnerability rate
if your gonna believe in the marketing

427
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,980
team then

428
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,600
sucks for you here's these guys did and
so they got on the news

429
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,450
a so everyone heard %uh pool right and
there is on the brutal and there is

430
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,320
likely to bleed or something like that
there's all sorts appears as a verse

431
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,910
that bike

432
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,700
you know just kept rearing its ugly
brutal head a

433
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,290
but its kinda go into what made pool

434
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,580
I what it was right why is everyone so
scared so for

435
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,890
you know we we had to leave the slide
and you know usually we give this talk

436
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,510
to you

437
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,590
you know not necessarily a full app sec
drought-stricken after you know

438
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,910
here what's SSL ratso a cell's magic

439
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:42,020
and a your attic somewhere

440
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,030
for the road switches it with a key

441
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:49,610
where's Troy base64 encryptor 2003
another area and the

442
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,920
the USA for tax record that somebody
cracker

443
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,520
the survey 64 attendance record it so
okay XO

444
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,670
I your just quick rundown vivo version
addresses also

445
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,770
the mobile version has a cell for pool
was a SSL version

446
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,570
3 I'll play my favorite game talk what
year did so.

447
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,140
3 about anyone forget

448
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,220
where is it well you know what up the
Niners yeah

449
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,820
moves closer your I he was 96 98

450
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,370
writer came in a long time ago right I
till

451
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,780
TLS replaced it in in the nineties and
anti lost 1.2

452
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,840
came out he doesn t retrieving dealers
1.2 is stills

453
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,110
you real ratso a servers and three as
the problem on a version that

454
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,600
a is going on so ready to be a history
lesson on how that how that works right

455
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,070
so so you have some issue P request
thread

456
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,860
that sensor data the first thing that
happens SLP three is there is going to

457
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,910
be a Mac added to the end that perhaps
so this is just the

458
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,799
to

459
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:53,100
as make sure the sensor data and hoping
tamper-proof

460
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,799
it's basically checks on for for this I
for tax rate is an actress and check out

461
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,980
the request fails

462
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,129
and it's letting you know that was
tampered with right

463
00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:06,499
and then the after the Mac it's added we
have some padding to get at it so

464
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:10,289
pat is gonna vary in size depending on
what I prescription you're using if

465
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:10,960
you're using

466
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,210
%ah wasn't DES is any bid it's gonna be
a month will be bitten

467
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,210
Eske sixteen-bit so

468
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,549
I yeah because patting on here pat is
important for

469
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:26,779
for this tax cut away going through this
so with the

470
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:30,690
last character patty is actually the
magic won writes the last character

471
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,639
outing with that does actually tell you
the sizeof the paddock rights that's

472
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:36,409
gonna say okay how far back

473
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,989
do I need to go on depicting this to get
the Mac Mini validate Mac in the

474
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:40,679
negative sense

475
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,580
be right so this whole pay I with the
padding the Mac said today to get sick

476
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,269
repeated

477
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:50,210
in Sobe three using the second block
chaining other

478
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:54,840
a which also was prepared for the ball
by which one was a primer

479
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,090
Easter them Prime Minister whatever

480
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,830
I so this was this yeah this is also
available

481
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:06,659
are afraid so there's one in many ways
or so outside watching works is easy I

482
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:07,899
think this whole blood

483
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:12,289
to break it up into you two groups and
going to %um

484
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:16,690
exclusive for them all it online right
to this is the encryption work this way

485
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,129
de Kirchner works that way I missus

486
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:23,700
history lesson sorry yes right so a if
the

487
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,840
decryption work backwards number that a

488
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,080
that that important characters that last
one tell you how long the padding is

489
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,789
tell you how far you need to go back
knowledge Mac that's important in this

490
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:35,320
attack

491
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,429
because I back failing and actually
dropping the request is what helps the

492
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:41,350
attacker

493
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,619
iterative talent is going to be able to
I

494
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:48,220
the stealing actual sensor data raped

495
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,380
so if say yes attacker man middling you
I N

496
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,520
you're on SLV free connection with the
attackers going to do

497
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,440
gonna take some wanna the CBC blocks

498
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,000
from the sensitive data so some early on

499
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,530
CBC block to copy it and pasted over

500
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,620
the and up at so

501
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,680
as we remember about that last character
being important

502
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,930
is going over right that last pair so
most the time what's gonna happen here

503
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,270
is that this request is going to drop
right back the overriding

504
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,570
adding that means that the length
characters wrong and you go back to the

505
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:25,910
Mac

506
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,100
I the Mac check fails and then the
connection

507
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:34,320
just drops right by about one in every
two hundred and fifty six times

508
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,080
I just kinda looks out stars align

509
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,180
and the length is right and we're all
good

510
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,380
connection is fine right so

511
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,710
if the attacker erase the same with Mike
JavaScript or something

512
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,130
you know just a ton of these requests
and I

513
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,700
keeps just copying pasting is over what
this allows them to do

514
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,470
is each time that they get that right
they know that that last character

515
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,080
they know that last character is as part
of that CBC block which is in cryptic

516
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,070
said today

517
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,750
right and so if they keep doing this
10,000 times

518
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,340
they're going to be able to get a few
characters I sensitive data

519
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,700
right so everyone said okay well what's

520
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,080
you know what's the worry just don't let
someone do couple thousand question

521
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,460
even then it's just a few characters at
a time what's the what's the problem

522
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:23,970
right

523
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,500
well the session cookies are and always
that long

524
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,590
right so that's the kind of thing to
worry about and they're also

525
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:35,010
predictably located you know early in
the sensitive data rates may know where

526
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,640
that is

527
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,750
so being apart a session token was you
know

528
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,310
feasible us this is the kind of thing
that we were we were

529
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:45,990
you know word about terrorist attack
I'll so

530
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,480
the fix is a pretty pretty simple and
kinda silly to say this conference so

531
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,130
I it's just don't use the you know one
of the oldest versions as a sell out

532
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:55,650
there

533
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,559
I just you're completely disable that of
course they're gonna lose some

534
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:02,960
Explorer 6 users to your website so

535
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,710
I personally say sorry bike I figured
out

536
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,170
I or a yeah a

537
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:15,500
if you are absolutely forced to use you
know to leave SSL version 3 enable their

538
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,180
website

539
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,400
I due to some customer base somewhere

540
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,670
being unable to upgrade their browsers I
you can

541
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,960
you can know disable the CBC a outer
them and use a different one

542
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,480
which will leave you vulnerable to other
things but we'll fix brutal a

543
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,820
and yeah that's contributed once I know
to the sun's kinda funny

544
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,990
because a in October last year Microsoft

545
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:42,800
submit a patch to you I sexism actually
allow you to enable TLS version 1.0 on

546
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,090
it

547
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,230
be sought to go into like all your
kitchen settings to specifically enable

548
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,530
it

549
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,940
and users are using a 6-2 prickly don't

550
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,650
even care whether it's important to use
a particular virginity loss just

551
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,980
if you're if you're using a6 you know
where the settings are

552
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,120
herbert a good the number two

553
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,679
we're moving on to shell-shocked Wilson
is best or so lucky said use the euro

554
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,929
branded phone abilities

555
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:09,870
on in shock came out for a couple weeks
afterwards everyone thought that you

556
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,460
know it's kind it was gonna take over
and this is how I like

557
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,290
the AI apocalypse come two starts behind
a turtle apocalypse

558
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:20,620
yet so it's extremely extremely easy to
exploit

559
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,309
its like on a scale of one to 10 10
being the easiest it's a 10

560
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:28,100
on he's to exploit the severity of it is
also a 10 because

561
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,960
from a good execution one can argue that

562
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,080
exploiting this is probably easier to do
than explaining it to someone

563
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,580
it's that that awesome from a single
request

564
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,130
single and I think request over the web
remotely your

565
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,080
reported back with a shell which as we
all know it's game over so

566
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,430
just going to a quick example when it
first came out around a raw a

567
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:54,030
gray gotta follow on Twitter he did a
lot to be done is it seems that came out

568
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,930
it does open source talk of mask which
people may or may not use for

569
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:02,840
your force purposes insulated air was
select a target IP range

570
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,200
to scan the internet with our weather
reports and

571
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,000
in his user-agent: cookies hose refer
headers on request

572
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,290
hatter's he just admitted in object
reference we're going to you later

573
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,360
and in a pink a minute to King back to
him so would you expect to see

574
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,429
if you scan the internet with all this
information and the shell-shocked by was

575
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:22,850
active

576
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,790
we're gonna call home he gonna pin you
back

577
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:31,050
now although that's not really hacked if
you will

578
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:35,470
I mean yeah it is but we believe that
this is the right thing in back and this

579
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,820
is from a quick a quick scan

580
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,150
like this could probably happen with the
first 30 seconds scare how are you

581
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,400
following me on Twitter how many people
saw this happen

582
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,510
life just a few you sure you got a good

583
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,530
100 new this is the I gotta follow this
is

584
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:51,780
this was within hours hoof shots are
coming out

585
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,030
right so this was kinda oh crap that's
real where

586
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:59,420
with a lot of things pain is sir so
others nothing to troubling about the

587
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,100
skin pingback: an open the question

588
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,250
why did the serving us back and how was
the ping command actually executed

589
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,929
now again look as real as emblem I can
go to

590
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:13,260
to detail into it back in a time before
we had pretty user interfaces everything

591
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,309
was done by the Commission

592
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:17,550
you know it allows us to do you ask
questions like what's going on in Crete

593
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,010
files list contents to the processes

594
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:24,170
delete everything on my hard drive just
I'm sure in just like the characters

595
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:27,210
with because you know everyone stories

596
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:32,679
um this is where the shot budgets the
vulnerability lies in being able to

597
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:34,770
arbitrarily defined environment variable

598
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:38,309
which specifies function definition
spaces like me into action

599
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:41,360
what's gonna happen here is that after
that last

600
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,309
curly brace on me and bass is going to
continue executing code as if it were

601
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:45,990
syntax

602
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:49,770
not strict now in the sense that the web

603
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,570
bash is extremely widely used about 50
percent I love

604
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,500
servers what times at this time or
Apache an Apache will process CGI

605
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:58,980
scripts

606
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:04,210
CDS get a process in bash so just making
a request to it and it's analyzing

607
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:08,600
you know the referrer header or the
user-agent if your injection is in one

608
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,809
of those places

609
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:15,179
coding execute just by making requested
so now the next question is

610
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,230
a him how you know season runs
destruction exact exactly that

611
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,730
we know the tricks metaphysically typing
the command you've got programs

612
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:25,040
ABCDE any that are all talking smaller
programs

613
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,690
FGH I et cetera because we do as
developers you

614
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,470
Center rewriting new programs you use
was already out there likable person

615
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:33,929
file

616
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,160
I'm not going to write the pressures of
unease autographed or something sorry

617
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,679
like that

618
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,290
a lot of these use the bash shell to
talk to each other

619
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,480
in the background now

620
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,570
this that the purpose of this is that
it's not limited just web servers

621
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,679
you know into things devices anything
that's running the best sellers can be

622
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,530
vulnerable to this

623
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,640
if you have an autonomous wifi-enabled
dog feeder at home

624
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,929
it can be part of the dash or best or
about it

625
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:02,570
few of or like all those who serve for
life exactly what that something all

626
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,600
these on my computer was Muslim a
processing batch much is extremely low

627
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,740
extremely old it's widely used its well
adopted

628
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,980
away reply whatever game

629
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:16,000
when I'll oh yeah I hollow shell shocked
but around

630
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,489
that 25 years this month for pool 25
years rate so

631
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,510
I we can actually the the other five are
not so sorry we can actually go and and

632
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,970
and look at that thread

633
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:29,359
where the the researcher like disclosed

634
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,950
a and he here here's a really quite
grasp the seriousness

635
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:36,450
vignette is gonna says hey I think I
found something in him

636
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,379
think it's been around a really long
time

637
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:43,659
and the yeah understatement and the
security of the decade rate

638
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:47,809
also might want my new favorite t-shirt
is my user agent is in this bitch also

639
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:50,089
exploit that actually patches
shell-shocked

640
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:54,109
those as the because that's what I saw
okay run the command but

641
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:57,930
the patches itself to be the best were
matter the

642
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,349
would be awesome to see select whoever
finds an extra good execution

643
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,640
it's very legal with the paths there's
but

644
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,390
Infinite PC maker okay cool so that's
also extremely easy to exploit

645
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:15,410
extremely easy to implement and cause a
lot of problems in the game

646
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:18,680
summit in a number one as I just
pursuant to is hardly

647
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,660
another brain affordability another game
over we thought the world was going to

648
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,220
end

649
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,710
table on couple weeks go by in obviously
the world's leader

650
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,180
no hardly does little bit different come

651
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,569
it does share seriousness with
shell-shocked in

652
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:40,480
helps appearance its are really easy to
exploit not as easy as shocked it just

653
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,579
looks good getting a bit better

654
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:45,319
what's going on here is in the open as a
sole

655
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:49,480
protocol there is a model called
heartbeat the architects engine

656
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,140
and with the heartbeat extension does is
it stops you from having have multiple

657
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,869
simultaneous Steelers connections

658
00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:00,099
going up same time because once you make
a request to a server over SSL

659
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:03,390
the person happens until a singer she
Asian face you know the exchange keys

660
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:03,769
they

661
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:09,309
talk to each other and a there's a lot
of overhead by having multiple tillis

662
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:11,200
sections ones like a packet drops

663
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,220
at Sarah and will get lighter in a
moment

664
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,259
so disrespectful background use internet
gossip the six

665
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:21,960
a again but this time but same time shot
came out but have the servers up there

666
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,509
where

667
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:26,480
Apache with engine exploding on the rise
now merger

668
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,109
active sites skin like %uh this is
Microsoft I a server was a third miscues

669
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:35,509
but these Microsoft s channel
implementation

670
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:38,569
up in a soul which is not normal her
bleed and doesn't mean that if you're

671
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:41,599
using a server that everything's gonna
be fine because you could still be using

672
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,809
like an engine EXR it's a proxy load
balancer

673
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:47,700
between we had a ton of our client a
review worldwide at those risk and

674
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,370
website abilities are it so we

675
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:53,070
you know we were letting customers know
about this whole body and

676
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,440
a tournament he said wall no thats you
know that's

677
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,240
are load balancer that's not us can you
get this off my report

678
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,690
you know we have like an order coming in
like no

679
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,540
we care for their comfort for it but I
don't know call more times to your load

680
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,590
what the company I don't that's my
remediation guidance red

681
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:15,020
so here's the problem you know a little
bit just

682
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,480
introductory static analysis with Linus
and it's funny this

683
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,780
I believe this push this commit happened
like at eleven o'clock on New Year's

684
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,800
for like 2012 service models probably
interested in

685
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,740
like leaving going to drink or something
with so yeah Justin secure

686
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,390
memory allocation here payload was
padding is taken from using but

687
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:38,740
no bounce checks the restraints so we
have user input making it directly into

688
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,360
the batter

689
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,960
now with this does is this makes the
size the heartbeat response control

690
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,810
a bird's at 64 kilobytes of memory now

691
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:51,520
so again what happened sir would like an
emblem a ramble about earlier

692
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,420
the First Nation make your website over
HTTPS a TLS handshake

693
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,760
negotiations is going to occur they're
going to negotiate keys are you say hey

694
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,540
I'm client on the server how you Dewin

695
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,950
them jealous connections made now if you
have like

696
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,360
dropped packet or a little lag or you
close your browser

697
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,120
tab for some reason really my cup a new
tell us connection is going to be made

698
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,760
you can have multiple he is happening at
the same time so that does that creates

699
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,740
a lot of overhead

700
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,900
what overhead its computationally
expensive so the heartbeat

701
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:25,600
extension was made now with the
heartbeat and as with much little

702
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,299
overhead

703
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,910
much less overhead basic will you know
details connections to life

704
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,490
so you can have your quest response
comes back recibe la response comes back

705
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:33,980
rather

706
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,540
yes you know the clan still there keep
the law such an act now

707
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,630
the heart be requesting to contain some
work was there we've got a payload

708
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:45,130
and then decides that the these are all
both user controlled values

709
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,840
for an attacker to exploit this the
request is crafted the contains a little

710
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,410
bit the data

711
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:53,360
the payload inside the request which we
would craft to be arbitrarily large

712
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,760
because given special values through
that one but a similar bill

713
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,110
now there is only sending one bite and
actual information:

714
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,200
we're gonna say the size 65536

715
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,950
its someone going to anything this
request no circus side

716
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,480
was gonna happen server memory is that
this information is going to be cached

717
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,940
and then you see the in black there P
which is the only one bite that I sent

718
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,160
and the rest that random data is
something within the memory bounds but

719
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,440
64 kilobytes when the keepalive response
occurs

720
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,350
the payload that same size along with
whatever's memories can be returned back

721
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:34,370
and that's it that's all Hartley was

722
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,600
you can do this by sending an ominous Rd
request you don't have to be

723
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,390
authenticated

724
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:41,690
not be logged in the server just has to
be running the ball mobile version

725
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,790
have open SSL and I forget which side it
was but someone ran a contest as soon as

726
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,670
came out because

727
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,220
of taking off in its a patch and the
contest was like show us our

728
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,290
as Okies and I forget who got it but

729
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:59,100
and when to come in like 45 hours it was
still billions on request

730
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,580
it was a limit on request because you
can get a random arbitrary peace memory

731
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:02,950
here

732
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,480
and that can contain all kinds of stuff
it can contain user-submitted

733
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,360
data now the tokens cookies passwords
credit card information

734
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,550
anything that unlike up a normal post
request could be cash in memory

735
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,950
and because this can take some random
data into something request over and

736
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:17,560
over again

737
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,250
you get back to 64 kilobytes with
information and then just like a police

738
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,380
pieced them all together

739
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,350
more importantly you can get the keys to
encrypt and decrypt traffic from the

740
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,250
server so if you happen to be

741
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,430
logging information you can go back and
then use those keys to do

742
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,330
the crypt it perfect for secrecy is not
enabled no other is protection baked and

743
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,850
SSL not everyone is

744
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:41,570
and that's it those are hardly so

745
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,220
the you know what I'm before we get to
are lessons later the hell you know

746
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,359
harpley also the reason is number one is
that

747
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:51,470
it you know it's now the barometer right
it's like

748
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,950
the it is it as bad as sharply right we
just saw something come out yesterday

749
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:59,140
I'm what was the worst thing ruthlessly
years ago

750
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,220
logjam to watch it now but need your
small

751
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,569
newtie Les Paul and and the broader is
wallace's Bazaar blue

752
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:09,319
pratt was like what all the the
reporters are asking for but that's of

753
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:09,730
course

754
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,599
of course I will make them run the other
really scary thing is completely

755
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,530
untraceable

756
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:17,950
if you if you got attacked great so he
said her resume compromise in

757
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:22,559
and you know assume your SSL keyser were
stolen if you were available to any

758
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:23,089
point

759
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:27,270
and then redo them in how many people do
we think that that

760
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:30,700
right so a yeah I'm gonna go with not
that many

761
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:35,010
okay show I like the little less than
where I so encryption is king

762
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:39,530
a that's kinda what I said at the
beginning and I saying that the end here

763
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,480
you know even though was in the top back
last year you know it's it's it's just

764
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,190
widely respected research the a lot of
times encryption research things like

765
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,569
crime in Beeston

766
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:52,910
you know we saw the bulldozers on the
past take

767
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,010
a very serious level have knowledge
about encryption

768
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:59,770
right like you know Year's Eve a you
most the

769
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,460
the researchers from University of
London from PhD candidates right so

770
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,359
all the community just wildly Respir
respecting corruption research into

771
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,859
makes makes the list every year

772
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:14,079
your prices more more important I these
days as we see all sorts of crazy

773
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,869
government things going on writer
creativity is also something that's

774
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:18,819
really

775
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:21,829
really highly respected right so for
anybody who saw this talk

776
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:26,460
last year was one more creative bug you
ever saw was a pixel perfect timing bird

777
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,700
on was using so many scene 05

778
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,809
video being SPG attacked you

779
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:36,329
completely bypass same origin policy
greater

780
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:40,319
right so really creative stuff in and
this year we we we see it once again

781
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,079
which is you know things like
shell-shocked better up to twenty-five

782
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:43,680
years

783
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,240
so much looked at something that's been
around a long and is used in a way

784
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,619
was must be used to it so shocked
twenty-five years heart bleed was an

785
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:52,320
implementation are from two years ago

786
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,600
a slow version three years 1998

787
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,030
it's down to attack us to love on from
1998 software so

788
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,890
so that you know if this takes
creativity isn't a book smarts the

789
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,170
stakes looking at something with
