working

154
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,590
a so is an initiative to get people to
defend those because we have to think of

155
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,380
in this is a great job to make it

156
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,620
as possible to keep the price that low
up

157
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,720
they aren't so sponsored comprises so
far from the possible in the end of the

158
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,460
conference that will be a toward

159
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,670
there are headphones rest 200 euros and
as an x-box

160
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,320
soul Barack only if you stay for the
closing toll

161
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,030
there's no guarantees when you put in
your cart believe and your loss and that

162
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,350
red light district might never come back
you will get your price: yet to be in

163
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,030
the closing on

164
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:35,910
yep so thank you to sponsors the really

166
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,910
so the fans are really those who help us
to make this happen mega-projects

167
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,340

168
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,300
so I cannot thank them enough we have a
great bunch

169
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,940
of keynote speaker speakers hands-on
sessions so

170
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,430
really exciting this conference when I
first saw the conference 2006 as I said

171
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,140
either I wanna have confirmed the
Netherlands and finally BCCI only nine

172
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,950
years later

173
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,330
and as the biggest absolutely you ever

174
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,710
because with more than 540 registrations
I think that's really great and

175
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:17,870
all up to you for make this a great
conference

176
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:28,210
keep calm have fun thank year

177
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,770
I thank you very much my 10

178
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,620
on this is just might make she gave me
only six minutes

179
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,830
and I think I have to maybe be even
shorter

180
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,120
I would try up I so this is just a
couple of words from the

181
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,440
a organization and to talk about

182
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,630
who is all laws what are we doing what
are you doing here

183
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,650
what could you do in the future on

184
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:55,450
obviously we're very happy to be in
Amsterdam this is a brilliant venue

185
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,550
and a brilliant team working here I've

186
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,110
I've heard quite a number of amazing
stories all this

187
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,650
this hue which capture the flag activity
going on

188
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,900
this is truly amazing who is over us

189
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,930
almost is a global community of about

190
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,570
forty thousand people in different
chapters around the world

191
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,330
everything we do is open source I mean
obviously as you hear you probably

192
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,530
already know that

193
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:25,500
but I thought it's worth mentioning we
have

194
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,560
at the moment 142 active projects

195
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,510
so this is a lot of opportunities and
stuff you can use

196
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:37,430
or you can come and join and work with
us together on these projects

197
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,650
all the projects are open you don't need
to ask for permission at a loss

198
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,950
you just do so feel free to when you see
something when you hear cool talk

199
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,210
and you think this project the school go
for it

200
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,290
okay no need to ask for permission but
ask for forgiveness later

201
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,780
I we have now 239 chapters

202
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,580
in the around the world so wherever you
go if you go on holiday and you kind of

203
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,180
feel it she and you wanna talk about

204
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,480
up sec look up your local chapter okay

205
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,510
I'm that there's a high probability
you'll find one

206
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,400
maybe not in the Maldives yet

207
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,380
but well I'm as I mentioned forty four
thousand people

208
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,710
participants and on our mailing list and
communities

209
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,730
so wherever you need an expert are you
looking for something where you

210
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,270
wondering about a question

211
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:33,149
I it's quite likely that we have someone
who knows the answer

212
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:37,759
government seem to like us I don't know
maybe they like open source maybe they

213
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,339
don't

214
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,730
but at least they like quality and I
think that's what we can offer them into

215
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,189
liver

216
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:47,110
I'll obviously and academics like us to
and we love them

217
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,600
as you've seen before with the capture
the flag I we also

218
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,639
of course love ok corporate members
because that is what helps

219
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,699
us keep this community arm

220
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:02,870
going and also keep the prices

221
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,160
to a level that is good for everybody to
participate and

222
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,569
of course we love our supporting
membership cruel

223
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:15,339
a at this moment it's about 1972 that's
close to my purse

224
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,339
year I think we need to go up now you
know this number needs to go up

225
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:22,910
so I hope if you like this conference
you

226
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,329
talk to others join the chapter become a
member

227
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:31,069
on that's one challenge with membership
XC everything we do is free anyway

228
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:35,430
so it's like you you're not getting
extra value

229
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,449
but what you getting is you supporting
the community and in that regard you

230
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:41,189
doing something good and getting value

231
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:44,350
but you get anything you get everything
for free already

232
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:49,500
but the as you can see I think at least
1972 people

233
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,309
think this is worth supporting and maybe
I can convince you by the end of this

234
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,230
conference to

235
00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:00,680
I'm we have a strong operations team
they make this whole thing goes smoothly

236
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,920

237
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,170
