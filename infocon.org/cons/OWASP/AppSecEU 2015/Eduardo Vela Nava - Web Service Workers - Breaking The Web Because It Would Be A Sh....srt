1
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,250
global another my nickname and peter is
here that

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,540
I like Twitter so get I would retire it
more than i right

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,470
but and their high-level security stuff
I like hiking stuff

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,800
I E was born in Mexico but a been in
saree far left six months or so

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
I am I'd working with security team
would like mickey and

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,890
a mister Albertini and so on I'm

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm how proud of our and that

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,140
thanks for the invite Mary and okay

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,390
so this is what we're going to talk
about today up anyone else with Isis

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,899
and yes their service workers exactly

11
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:51,399
so Apple they're not they're not any
type of service workers they are a very

12
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,829
special type of service workers

13
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,070
they are good-looking Sonata and they
are our website with workers

14
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,410
I'm so they it again though the
presentation so for someone to start

15
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,870
talking about why we're here

16
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,170
I am some obvious that we scenarios up
some

17
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,230
but then shall use cases for security
defense I'll

18
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,820
some potential use cases for security
offense

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,650
and that i personal question up does
anyone know

20
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,860
how many people are familiar with
service workers in general I okay

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,910
so I'll I gotta love you so I'll give a
brief introduction up maybe ten minutes

22
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,260
or so

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,850
on how it is but okay to a little bit
first I'm

24
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,860
okay so why are we even hear so that the
reason that I was ok a sexist

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,950
is because I people wanted to

26
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,330
I just went there on an airplane and I

27
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,440
if you try to you get an airplane a
debate about the Peter this is what

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,060
happens

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,090
and I you get a very cool game that you
can actually play in your phone

30
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,170
if you know but it's not with their so

31
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,650
out I love them lol maybe ten years ago

32
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,820
I gears I was created as a brother to

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,450
try to solve this problem and that kind
of set the foundation to where we are

34
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:58,950
today

35
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,550
so I mentioned briefly so they cut three
things a local server

36
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,500
at the base and workable and all of
these things didn't exist in the

37
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,440
web I think your cell so local server
was essentially a way to therapy

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,670
local files like an engine Xserve year
sever running locally

39
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,700
but that what does the origin of the

40
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,890
up site running at the base which was a
sick you like that the vase

41
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,930
at that point with have local storage
unit

42
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,159
that and I wear purple which essentially
Westport reading

43
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,359
I JavaScript and one very important
thing to mention

44
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,939
he that it less a plugin like you have
to install it and then it look in your

45
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:35,739
browser but you have to install it

46
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,719
and that meant that it wouldn't work in
all cases so

47
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,810
a situation well with you it was
cancelled a couple years later

48
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,980
and i the reason was mostly because I
most of these features made it into the

49
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,310
wet

50
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,099
so they wear standardized as index TV
for the database thing

51
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:55,980
and upswept workers for their none that
I think an application cache

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,909
application cache what's the thing that
was supposed to be like the local server

53
00:02:58,909 --> 00:02:59,359
think

54
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:03,139
but I'll get to that in a minute so

55
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:06,760
ash I'll a crush essentially how it
works

56
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,010
and it still works today is that its
release the files

57
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,310
that will get cached of light and it's
just like a Super Cache

58
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,739
and and so on and a I'll out somewhat
negate has two

59
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,969
about be built but they didn't get much
much traction and you can see it simply

60
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,169
by the fact that Twitter

61
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,269
steel today is not a available in an
airplane

62
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:30,280
and I some nyquil Jake archibald

63
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,729
cool estate I mean jobs work today

64
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:37,959
at road this this not reasonable so this
article coughs colds

65
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,799
application cache a dish back and
essentially that summary of the

66
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,810
composition is that

67
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,400
they signed they signed a publication
cash was gonna

68
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,069
flaky and it can only do one thing and
so it's like a Swiss Army knife with

69
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,699
that the same thing again and I

70
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:53,729
that's what that means I think I'm and
it was unlike

71
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:57,229
just within one year of a application
cache startin to get

72
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:01,049
a lot of up %uh the popularity

73
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,359
so don't know where that came to the
Asus at his

74
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:08,040
this article is is so funny that I I
really wanted to put it there and I will

75
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,790
summarize it

76
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,939
ass at he's in a party and then

77
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,419
there is so much people and then no one
knows each other and then there is this

78
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:16,049
girl

79
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,169
that says like hi my name is def and
actually not do know one person is

80
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:20,620
called that so there is a real

81
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,530
name and ass so what the other than and
then he's like oh I'm not post or so the

82
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,669
ok if the shelf

83
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:29,500
and and then this application cache come
see it as like a I'm like

84
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,790
I'm application cache I turn your I have
experience from sup ask the success

85
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,680
and I just don't get one thought on bush
cetera

86
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,960
and essentially with Jake was trying to
the point it was trying to make is that

87
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,650
he knew

88
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,000
application cache better and it actually
is not as good as it that'd make

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,620
child so I he wrote that respect for
service workers

90
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,090
a within the same here I think anyway so
before with other service workers

91
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,070
there is something else our coworkers
that I went in through a little bit a

92
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,760
little before

93
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,540
and workers are essentially gasket
threats are some let

94
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,680
and they work essentially the the way
they work is like you have a website

95
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,750
and then the west face can spahn I like
another

96
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,800
execution context another global yes
rick Scott and then you communicate with

97
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,870
it with both message

98
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,960
and you can trigger as many as you want
and then you have workers and then you

99
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,480
have shared

100
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,430
workers and sure workers are shared
across multiple but what they just

101
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,040
and so on so that the bus essentially
what their workers

102
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,730
and should work and service workers are
he had a Dr like when we get his workers

103
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,100
at the Center for the application cache
like to give them a programmatic API

104
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,820
rather than the clarity 1 so that's a
service workers is

105
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,800
so the way it usually works like that
you have a website and have the clout

106
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,600
and then

107
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,070
i would tell his workers a pass at the
website azeris worker and then have

108
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,440
clout

109
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,910
and at the Seveso Chris got up in the
middle of all of these quests

110
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,940
and the seven or perhaps the millionth
and

111
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,130
there are five main events but several
there's

112
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,980
more up for it there's an extensibility
platform so you could have more in the

113
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,360
future

114
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,830
so there s by making them much I'm

115
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,260
prefetching that means before the
website is even started to get access to

116
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,540
when the brosser things that they

117
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,700
user might want to what will it take the
other one is with navigating

118
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,210
when their browser has committed to go
to that website no one is some resources

119
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,520
so when you're in a website

120
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,210
also resources including cross sorry and
resources will go to the service worker

121
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,380
a backrub think that means when the
website it's going to go offline

122
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,470
it might want some operation to happen
and I

123
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,360
push notifications that means but the
user is not online at all maybe

124
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,480
at an external website will I

125
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,550
a web server will travel to cash in and
spider web work

126
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,470
strangest so imma this very collimation

127
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,840
that it take to me like maybe 2001 which
I'll

128
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,200
see if it works say this with extra to
come

129
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,720
a 40 percent there the service of
process and shit it's called his style

130
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,440
then the attorney gates and he got a
Twitter and then if there was a process

131
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,970
n shit

132
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,230
the know the subway sources like the
logo and the sub CSS and cetera

133
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,210
are triggered then the bathroom sink
late as another user click street for

134
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:01,720
will

135
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,600
at date so is what response and

136
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,510
the zip exit the website and something
later

137
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,110
I Mario mention me on twitter and then I
get

138
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,780
litigation I don't remember what it was
about actually but a

139
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,140
it happened alright so add tell me what
s before can only that the think one

140
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,440
thing

141
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,030
which class cash resources now they can
do two things they can read complete

142
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,040
request information

143
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,910
and they get great control over their
response and requests that

144
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,780
are being made and only two attempts the
first one is

145
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,540
the user is trying to post a tweet still
Twitter

146
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,570
and that if it is wit and

147
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,830
at the same as what essentially is
associated before that happens and it

148
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,470
can decide whether to for what it or not

149
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,500
and Twitter never knows about his
request this is something different that

150
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,140
before was not possible because before

151
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,670
it was impossible to no a post body of a
request

152
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,720
like you quote there what's ever call
know it

153
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,730
but not just got and is something that
not even because that

154
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,910
be like a proxy like up a service
workers becomes like a proxy and I think

155
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,300
that there is not a canoe is like
whenever there is a request it can

156
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,580
respond with the Everett what

157
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,400
it can respond with another request from
another related resource

158
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,530
written response without with a file
that it manually create

159
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,900
and so on and so forth so that's very
interesting because that

160
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,880
allows for requests trafficking that I'm
going to get into in a minute so

161
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,130
there's a couple of things that come to
mind when you're starting a service

162
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,260
workers and most of them

163
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,540
where others by the spec others in one
way or another some of them where

164
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,940
I accept that ass Selby and I

165
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,960
we'll see try so at Doris

166
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,300
so every other specs I i don't know why
I just

167
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,960
find them like a relaxing so out there
is a SASE section in the service worker

168
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,520
spec

169
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,360
that at explains in the security
considerations that Seth

170
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,420
service workers create opportunity for
about actor but then

171
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,380
a bad day into about eternity and that
like the most poetic price action in the

172
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,290
spec

173
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,420
and its it I am very happy that I J Kerr

174
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,510
or Alex or whoever they did put it there
because he's like a

175
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,740
he's very memorable and let me explain
more or less what they were thinking or

176
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,880
what I think they were thinking

177
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,420
so at the once you have a so is worker
that works more like that

178
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,440
it's always in the middle right so now
it's is supposed to work when you are

179
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:17,900
offline

180
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,780
which means that the web said we'll
never get requested even when you are

181
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,280
online

182
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,510
or to rephrase that: what that means

183
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:30,310
is that if there's an XSS that allows
you to install a service worker in some

184
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,750
way

185
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,410
then the website will never be able to
recover from that or

186
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,160
that what's the problem there were tanks
of so to mitigate that

187
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,100
they were they they restricted the
number of ways that you can process that

188
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,930
was work in which I

189
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,040
I'll going to in a minute but I
imagining that you once you pass as I

190
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
was walking stopped

191
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,440
there's nothing that you can do one of
them is that you can use at

192
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,310
and I'll also be a case like you make so
many cookies that when the request

193
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,930
happens

194
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,530
the server cannot respond to it which
works in a lil I what service

195
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:04,370
and another way that nothing you can do
is that you can if the website rice 200

196
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:04,980
Easter

197
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,520
you azeris worker you just stop that
from happening because I was woken you

198
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,170
can say like

199
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,170
no I'm so yep at

200
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,110
its it's very that's what I think that's
what they were thinking so they can

201
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,320
trace a couple of

202
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,430
think that try to kind of mitigate the
number of places that

203
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,720
cool resulting total punish am right

204
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,650
so what are several others so I'll
explain the same from Mexico and I i

205
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,220
leavin

206
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,920
I live in the US and I have the the US
because I Korean maybe senator

207
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,310
side really care about this I
immigration thing and I when I was

208
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,010
looking at the

209
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,170
I'll way that since emerging policy and
workers and

210
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,190
some resources and this that works and
realize that is very similar to

211
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,940
immigration and I'm going to explain
this

212
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,590
here so as a member there are some
player

213
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,190
you trust that their party or like that
their country national with some other

214
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,130
rights and privileges

215
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,600
so for example if you hire someone that
person called though a lot of bad things

216
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,930
in Gurnee I it doesn't they then play
our them by their doesn't get any

217
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,290
privilege over there over that their

218
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,670
over the person it kinda like you a
person with that and

219
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,480
but you get to specify one thing and
that one thing is that what they will do

220
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,910
so for example if you are like this
company that implies that if a miracle

221
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,130
for the TSS

222
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,200
and employees like an engineer call for
the JS and salesman call for the safe

223
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,570
and that I I know up someone else call
for this e-mail

224
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,610
then you can mess around and feel like
okay

225
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,870
now the designer is an engineer and now
the self nothing is a salesman at

226
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,710
Atlanta

227
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,410
and that usually doesn't really matter
but in this case initial email

228
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,360
us it does matter and that lets loose
cell at that but that's it especially

229
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,920
for planes at things from

230
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,750
the very very beginning with materials
and the fire to me recently to

231
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,320
at the flash for example and especially
the if the same more or less

232
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,490
side-effect so the wait the way these
matters

233
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,630
is the class script source and new
worker became

234
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,820
in two different ways and one of them is
that the script source

235
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,820
runs in the context and the origin of
the caller

236
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,010
like of them by their off day on the web
said during scriptures

237
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,910
what pressure workers service workers
run in the context of the hosting site

238
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,500
this means that if you called Hispano
Walker

239
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,900
then just simply costing filed that kind
of looks like to have a script that

240
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,160
works with your script will be able to

241
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,900
to very bad things like up you know all
the things that I took before

242
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,530
so to prevent that what I day

243
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,790
better as it is at create a very strict
immigration part

244
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,840
that policy which means that I do not
allow to

245
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,380
outsource that workers you're only
allowed to outsource that script source

246
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,640
and some resources and there isn't it
matters then again

247
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,190
is because you will not be allowed to
spun Assamese workers from a different

248
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,310
Oregon and I which because I will mean

249
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,710
that that will be a problem another
thing that they enforce is content-type:

250
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,110
like you have to have the right content
type and at

251
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,590
and when you want me as a million the
race one thing that

252
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:02,260
it's important to mention which is that
if you have a way of hosting a desperate

253
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,680
filing the same the main

254
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,070
in the same are you with the right
content type then it usually will mean

255
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,620
that you will test also is working

256
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,920
well you have an excess rescue this is a
stepping stone

257
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,830
up however there's a couple cases where
that actually does happen

258
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,570
one of them is the S&P and others are
going to the but that's actually the

259
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,360
location

260
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,480
and that I was looking for getting on
the internet and I didn't real

261
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,959
that was the case in local deal a
yesterday that they forget today

262
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:35,120
so anyway CMP I'm into something you're
allowed to issue 100

263
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,690
and workers have this call calling for
scripts and the first group essentially

264
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,699
allow you to

265
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:43,709
Inc if I can include for in other
languages and what you can do then is

266
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:44,940
like if you can import

267
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,870
you can't make that call than usual you
just get up to object but if you get an

268
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,420
array

269
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,420
you can get to control it and then you
could do something like that that will

270
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,649
be one way that you could do it

271
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:56,260
I the other than the shipping port
scripts is that if you are able to cause

272
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,870
such file or terrible to do it

273
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,070
then you able to bypass expected that
options

274
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,949
at no content that checks and 0
simmering in check certain foreign

275
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:04,870
policy checks

276
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,310
which means that I you you come across
all of these fancy things I think it's

277
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,980
interesting that I forgot to mention
just now

278
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,079
is that this is all the way of creating
I files that are in the same origin

279
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,470
which is be at their bluff and the
filesystem EPS

280
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,690
which she is happy about that create
object doesn't help

281
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,209
and then that gives you hell that is in
Korean out

282
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:28,730
chrome disease to work until very
recently and now you then you have to be

283
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,610
some argue but see what is Rex for
example on it will work with the pore

284
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,350
strips as well

285
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,040
first offenders anyway so that's how
they indicate that all the decisions

286
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,819
I many thanks are also something they
were very concerned about

287
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:44,440
and they can be prevented with I am SSL

288
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,170
but anyway so let's say that I am in the
middle kinda hoped so one thing that you

289
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,500
when you cover the service worker at now
the money to me know the concept is what

290
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:51,899
right

291
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,019
and on they can do is that they disable
all security features like they can

292
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,930
disable CSP the console extra option and
so on and so forth

293
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,079
so we have a website thinks that they
are secure against that in line or

294
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,660
whatever access when you have a service
worker that is installed

295
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,920
they can disable I love those features
which is important because some people

296
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,819
use ESP

297
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,850
for %uh some boxing purposes so you can
say well

298
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,209
such some books and politicians and I
think you can do with a now you have

299
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:16,750
like this type of course Texas s

300
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,050
which means a something that its is then
shared without you having committed any

301
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,560
website

302
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,029
and he is he is running there in the
background without you being able to do

303
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:25,500
anything

304
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,790
I yep up mitigate

305
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,190
they they tried to prevent you from be
getting stuck in the first place with

306
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,019
SSL

307
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:36,070
and most other thinks where based on
muscle

308
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,440
is offenses were based on trying to
protect they XSS

309
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,610
Nexus S up stepping stone attack but
they think that a sec find the most

310
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,710
interesting is what you can do the other
way around which

311
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,030
okay the pope I haven't finished and
then after a Miss isolation the thing

312
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,750
that you can do

313
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,820
is that at most what does many web sites
like a is being a guest feel

314
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,040
are like a universities that allow you
to host files in the same directing the

315
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,470
same

316
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,540
origin other files but at

317
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,080
yes it by the by the rectory so the
seventh most people realize it was a

318
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,540
problem

319
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,740
so they they only allow you to be

320
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,270
at this level with water for the pot
that you the same as what was that

321
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,900
unless you have Heather and that's also
the energy here will be like a typical

322
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,090
like at maybe directories are separated
by at this very thin

323
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:25,060
I control but in reality it's

324
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,290
a is no real security control for sale
as well but at least

325
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,000
they made it so that if someone decides
to put like a jungle in front I think

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,190
the person that everyone else

327
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,690
but so I that Scutaro they

328
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,880
try to fix most of the ovations and and
a bit more letter which up like there is

329
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,470
some

330
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,770
such as we depart scripts and file URL
summit cetera but in general is not

331
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,080
about

332
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,450
so there s before going to the other

333
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,910
that of attacks that go the other way
round one thing that

334
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,490
it's interesting to mention is that so
he's not responsible for security

335
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,700
and for the fence and as it's kind of
interesting

336
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,530
art it might be interesting to think
about it so when the CSRF

337
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,189
I the most obvious idea will be like
okay so now you have a service worker

338
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:09,520
I you can just prevent the request from
being done in the first place service

339
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:09,910
worker

340
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,400
and I before that posts tweets

341
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,310
happens you can do to stop it the
problem is that he doesn't really work

342
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,900
because at some resources

343
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,270
on the this only happens for some
resources within that

344
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,780
out they said you were installed so
upset about the pace can just fetchit

345
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,170
without you getting a sense yet

346
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,300
at least a day at a much in it in the
future but you can do

347
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,470
is that you can force at the club level

348
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,020
that on request must tell us is a
fucking then you can add with service

349
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,470
worker

350
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,280
up but or otherwise is not very useful
for CSRs

351
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,270
I think that some people might think of
his success practices maybe you actually

352
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,650
do have a chance to the some pics

353
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,860
and one of them is going to you can
create an XSS filter

354
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,169
for

355
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:51,230
Firefox because they are the only ones
who doesn't have one and

356
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,230
and I think that you can do is that you
can

357
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,159
kinda force all requests on the
additional requests to be

358
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:01,980
to to life BSA from there like you
cannot you can make them

359
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,590
not the right be a I that you cannot you
can I have an example

360
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,580
said you can't make it to it a handler
shouldn't be accessible took several

361
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,159
users

362
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:13,639
not because he is so it does because of
excess as reasons for example or get

363
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:14,359
medications

364
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,499
so then the same as what it will be like
okay you don't seem to be coming from a

365
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:18,049
client that

366
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:22,289
I know of so just got up yes additive
alright had

367
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:25,429
I and then Peter never gets to see it so
there's a CSRF

368
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:29,419
and I think that you can do is cut the
security policy or extra options thinks

369
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:33,619
up side white so for some web sites or
for some well pick asians is very very

370
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:34,309
difficult

371
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:38,499
to set up Heather across the
qualification it may be simple for some

372
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:41,769
web sites that have a up single column
single separate thing

373
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:45,119
but as soon as you get very complicated
this is very difficult almost impossible

374
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,299
so what I was looking people actually do
that you called gas resources worker

375
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,029
that I just set up sets up

376
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:54,779
I CSP or up extreme options response on
everything that doesn't know about

377
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:58,739
nothing they can do which is also a
little bit interesting is that once you

378
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,139
install the service worker

379
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,679
without having to change the HTML the
page you can not like some books I love

380
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:05,529
the JavaScript

381
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:08,559
and I love the sub resources that are
being that regard to the user

382
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,149
and that's also kinda interesting
because you collect and look like a

383
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,820
lunatic so simple as that everyone seems
to complain about

384
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,960
I am right so up

385
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,980
some potential that protects workers so

386
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,139
I sum up this at while I was
investigated there is no cuz I thought

387
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:25,509
some

388
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:28,960
books I'm going to present the ones that
are that I will not

389
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,429
I feel bad about the speaking publicly
up

390
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:37,190
so one of them is I script errors so the
script errors are usually not

391
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,960
I I usually supposed to be on the next
same region

392
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,909
and the reason for that is because if
they re saddest rink

393
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:48,529
that he simply the suggested file then
that the strength cool

394
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:52,059
add to their I reference error which
says like

395
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:55,340
CSRF 1234 FIF is not the point and

396
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,840
dissent at this table fare src only ex
post the same Oregon requests

397
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,950
for exactly for this

398
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,610
in because otherwise I thought about the
side will be able to rate in a limited

399
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,559
way some what they're called off another
what

400
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,630
so the way that they were strictly see
the URL East I

401
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,200
the same aryan then included however
with his work as you can get a like oh

402
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,170
yeah I'm totally

403
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,190
at giving you the request for for the
cum are from the same region

404
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,240
but actually is a response from a
different website and

405
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,309
at that level the Brussels and know that
this response come from somewhere else

406
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:30,440
so that so that you can do another one
is that it works in Firefox but the

407
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,030
Firefox

408
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,220
a it is interesting up the way that they

409
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,570
you can edit content types and what you
cannot know the actual response %uh for

410
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,799
requests you can know

411
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,970
what that that that would return because
depending on the content IP address does

412
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,830
a different value

413
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,880
so what you may not be able to read the
actual data I in that when the response

414
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,720
you can see like okayed it with any men
charged with the this in another

415
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,390
others am another thing that works is
that fun faces are supposed to be some

416
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,370
reason for some reason

417
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,740
and you conduct that is something I
think I said in a script

418
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,900
they you make the request for a similar
in front this service worker intercepted

419
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,660
and response with a cross Rd in front

420
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,960
and essentially you live by the same
orient restrictions

421
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,549
and you could have a box and that you
should probably investigate by you

422
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:16,540
and that's another thing which is a West
African that or the lack of progress

423
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,340
striking

424
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,790
which I'll be a couple examples said it
was trafficking means that you can make

425
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,679
a request

426
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,179
from one API that this is requesting a
way that you like it

427
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:30,850
and then use that responsive than
request in a different place

428
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:35,540
so I 1x employees become so there's this
API call when you get to the 10 beacon

429
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,919
that you a lot allows you to put at any
website and then

430
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:42,390
allows you to send that pose a threat to
that URL with any content type

431
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,710
so you can make a positive as with any
content type and then you can intercept

432
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,390
the response

433
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,710
and put it anywhere you want like you
completing the style sheet in the CSS

434
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,260
file in a script that or whatever

435
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,620
as I mentioned earlier that you can I
issue a Request for one thing and put it

436
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,780
in the whatever sink you want

437
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,429
another thing you can do for example
that up we found

438
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:03,380
well I found two be useful in a couple
cases what's that

439
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,660
you can so before it was not possible to
get

440
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,520
a script source for example with a POS
request I mean it was just impossible or

441
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,059
out

442
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:14,130
or a flash fire or something like that
now with his office is possible

443
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,180
the same with PS intercept the request
for scripts or so and then get a

444
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,710
response with a trip to a response for
up both requests are

445
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,860
at request or something that witcover
wes is very interesting because you can

446
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,300
respond with empty strings

447
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,890
which is also very a and knowing up for
the server

448
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,000
you can also make requests with over
long URL's

449
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,250
with overtime cather's that sometimes
allow you to control the

450
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,700
I am they ever message second say like
that this that

451
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,060
anyway there's usually a message today
you can respond and then you may be able

452
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,470
to control some of the response

453
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,170
like bill to redistribute tickets or so
am

454
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,110
and you can also read redirects because
of said TSP allows you to really if

455
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,560
cspi national parks allow you to rate
that redirect chance

456
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,780
be at this a CSP think and

457
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,360
before you were only able to do it for I
sub requests now because

458
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,890
service workers you can do it for any
type of request including like those

459
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,070
requests but requester

460
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,870
angling for cars and of course requests
but

461
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,140
I am and that one which is at most
interesting one

462
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,580
that I I think is that you can i mix and
match

463
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,800
which is our rent responses and
responses half

464
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,640
there are two things to talk about this
one so one of them is that are some

465
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,420
requests like for images on both

466
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,430
out the OBD 0 and so on that I wish a
request with the ranch

467
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,820
Heather and ensure that if you don't
know how it works he that it said like

468
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,270
okay want a little bit of this

469
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,610
up his request and then it makes an hour
west I i want a little bit more a little

470
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,630
bit torrent sites on

471
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,710
so I there this server this the client
makes a request for

472
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,850
outrage Heather and then that I was
looking like he is sure

473
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,190
this is a response right like the
response from zero to three is full

474
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,410
and then at this day it planted like
okay thank you much

475
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,440
now I want from three to six and then

476
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,840
now this response close to that we owe
whatever for example

477
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,210
and the Rio whatever response would like
market will take no black they will get

478
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,010
ignored because they are they talking
that the

479
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,260
full a so the six me that the complete
contact

480
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,800
they called the complete containment so
it will ignore everything after this 6

481
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,230
essentially sauce at the end of the day
you have a response that makes this

482
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,000
same margin with sorry thinks which is
gonna be interesting but Anna

483
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,190
like you can do other things but I can
be able to figure out superb I think

484
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,770
that you could do

485
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,970
because of the things that you're
allowed to put the range goes on

486
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,970
I am on out there was recently up that

487
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,759
blue screen up that Inc information
Internet Information Services

488
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,460
pup and you go only to rate requests as
a margin

489
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,690
I would issue for example you could be
able to do it cuz surgeon Adam

490
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,509
but so I won't tell you the first to
know how what time it is

491
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:47,710
but a I would affect disease I did forty
five minutes

492
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,200
I think today that twenty minutes again
this happened last time as well

493
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,690
like mister I back and remember the last
time

494
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,899
it looks like the same and a hat anyway
this matter so this is more than ever

495
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:00,990
with the pope SP members are simple eek

496
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,309
on the PayPal Inc fun facing a remap ask
on security policy that I click

497
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:07,429
47 the bureau said workers thus there
with what there are things I will have

498
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:08,809
it is a problem will be fixed

499
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:13,190
and with a worse things are attack IDS
like way that you can't use

500
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,240
http for random stuff and the way things
are

501
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,610
defense stuff like a CSRF prevention
like you can say like I'd only allowing

502
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,139
going to

503
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:24,919
you're only going to a request that come
from I peaceable

504
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:28,769
I'll frames for example or reqs
togethers

505
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:31,869
some boxing all the Dallas trip that
everyone has ever everyone always asks

506
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:32,499
for

507
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:36,860
limiting the negation et cetera
opportunity for a CSP a-tither

508
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,090
alright and I'm at

509
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,090
I actually ate most of these things I
did get with it

510
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,249
a a crime has is very very useful

511
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:49,769
debugging for service workers so
essentially putting back on some writing

512
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:50,100
some

513
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,419
but some point they realize that that
less taking too much time

514
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:58,049
psych made is very loud that you go take
a look at the MTS get up for this thing

515
00:25:58,049 --> 00:25:59,179
so you can take a look

516
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:03,220
am alright so this is now Q&A after they
have like

517
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,509
time for 25 questions I you can't do I
have to say yes

518
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:11,799
act and you do blank with his workers
and that essentially going to the Pro

519
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:12,309
yes

520
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:15,619
I i'm a lot for them to talk about some
of the things that I said here

521
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:19,600
a I hope not but if I did that let me
know and I'll

522
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,539
how to explain aunt it wasn't just a
plot to play up in these people music

523
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:25,749
video and you to add me

524
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:31,420
that with alright any questions yeah I
speak too fast

525
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:37,100
yep I get here

526
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,560
at the event is less this has been a
while at it most obvious thing

527
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,890
as I mentioned before like they treat
they took care of possibly thinks

528
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:49,130
and they did a very good job I however
there's a compromise that has to be made

529
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:49,880
between

530
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,970
eyelash usability and are arming

531
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,250
developers and like knew at that
position vectors and

532
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,430
its cool I mean they they know the
consequences and a

533
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,670
that's okay i like it I yep

534
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:14,120
yet so asset actually CCSP

535
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,810
everywhere curse issue a case
complicated 27 Lucas

536
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:21,180
our clients which means that they are
bound to CSP

537
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,480
they are like its combat they are they
about the CSP essentially

538
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,760
and I so import script school we meet at

539
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,800
be a a CSP for example and then for
actually

540
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,850
making the request for service worker
they reset service worker

541
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,810
rather that then you can't respond that
you can't 403 if you wanted

542
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:43,320
for some get you will have to do it at
the

543
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,120
HTP like you can go you have to
configure Apache so that it

544
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,880
pretty terrace by request week the
savings work rather it for a treat

545
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,780
but that wouldn't work for things like
up artist MAPI a blog URL or something

546
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,150
like that

547
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:59,260
but a it might and it that the that the
trade-off

548
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,790
that they did that there's out long
balls from Jake I work explains like a

549
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:08,120
public service 11 announcement service
workers are coming and this at all the

550
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,970
things that all developers in the world
I should know

551
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,400
and I don't know how many people have
actually read that book the post but at

552
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,380
you should really talk cook else

553
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:30,289
yes

554
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:30,749
yes

555
00:28:30,749 --> 00:28:34,289
but you need to be able to do you there
they impose import scripts

556
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:38,759
trick or I'll you have to have an open
redirect would like the file system

557
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,479
thing within per scripts or something
like that

558
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:43,529
but at yes having a a single XSS

559
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:46,629
they tried to prevent thing as much as
possible with this

560
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:52,399
up Heather San a same directory thing at
a time opting for money to me like it

561
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,429
has to be a prison cell

562
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:57,009
because if you go to a coffee shop and
so there is a global terrible

563
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:01,349
so you don't solicit or throw itself
cook yep

564
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:05,549
week

565
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:09,309
I always get there early

566
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:12,659
so it's going to get so one of the
places I was mentioning that its its

567
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,570
kind of tricky to the ranch other thing

568
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,389
is because the type of saying sup I
issue and respond to

569
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:22,899
French others are kinda limited so you
may be able to do it for some some

570
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:23,590
resources

571
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,259
but not all of them so for example Image
S out the OP deal

572
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:30,279
I down go to track you definitely can do
it and I'm not

573
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:33,669
might be that because in some browsers
they're on some Oregon but

574
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:38,239
the it's not always the case so script
is not one of those that issue

575
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:41,950
or accept range a respect quests our
response

576
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,129
are both such cool

577
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:49,179
yet I yeah it's

578
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:53,179
II need to do something about it yeah
shirt they only images to be honest but

579
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:53,619
yeah

580
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:56,720
I like I i don't have much

581
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,929
content okay yet

582
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:04,940
cool iight anything else gift

583
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,869
yesssss exactly excellent thank you for
asking it doesn't work no

584
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:13,619
