1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,200
talking about sir is it a flash I just
very quick reminder

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,160
that I'm when you finish one talks
finished journey get all the PLO's

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,189
on your way out members a box up there
with some red and green cards

4
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,189
it up the talk grab onto the green cards
put it in if he didn't like the talk in

5
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,750
the unlikely event you did not get the
red color place

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,700
get green card boxes that we like to see
okay thanks very much

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,390
is a que on

8
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,489
hi everybody I like green the same

9
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,920
so had have here too present

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,700
resent the flesh actually let the
pressure is on

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,210
can you hear me well is an expedition
technique

12
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,340
that'd I almost a year old the

13
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,390
sold is talk with actually

14
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,050
hockey's welcome what it is might also
on want

15
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,290
steelworks what's was not fixed

16
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,090
what up six probably and how it is also
useful

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,840
now how can be used for now and on

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,900
so I think

19
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,590
most if you are a already and

20
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,970
knowledgeable about Jason p.m. which is
in the is

21
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,110
so I'm just two know how much time to I

22
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,320
to underpaid on that those I'm wondering
how many

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,909
you know what season he is the country's
mind

24
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:37,840
okay great I would just make a very
short introduction

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,630
and bikes and so is going to miss this
great technology

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,700
up okay in

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:59,000
probably doesn't like let's try again

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:10,860
I would

29
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,390
yeah good

30
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,790
and okay great citizen it is great
technology

31
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,819
to bypassing region policy Norman raid

32
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,600
to basically if you want to embed a
script a from

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,980
and and I domain you can do it with the
script

34
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,050
time right and but

35
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,610
and this is exactly what season P a
exploits right

36
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,770
so if you want to execute JavaScript
from another region and

37
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,760
and you don't want to use you know like
the proper

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,470
way of doing that you can use a hockey
and is happy is

39
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,160
and pending an external

40
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,190
script which has for example

41
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,440
this one and the only thing that Khan
them to Dublin intercom

42
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,450
concern pound chair and

43
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,880
specify a call back in this step

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,890
these kids reflected call back right

45
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,980
and deep content of DAT

46
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,670
reply would be at the beginning
reflected call back

47
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,760
which is the functions that if I and in
some detail that is passed across the

48
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,270
region

49
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,700
right it the only important thing about

50
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,870
hair to compete at its men report on
crucial to understand that that is that

51
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,470
the attacker controls the first bites on
the response right

52
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,000
so you specify in the world for a meter
the call back

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,810
and that combat is the first bite for
the response

54
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,320
okay so it reagan to

55
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,950
I'd both rate

56
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:49,810
so

57
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,430
but is it the questions about flash
thanks so much left fights published by

58
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,770
Simon & Mining

59
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,390
and they're a binary blobs and

60
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,990
at in that column

61
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,700
Parmenter of season 10 points you can

62
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,550
generally only specify alphanumeric
characters

63
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,850
not mine bites to and who

64
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,329
it would be cool if you could at
transform any sweet file

65
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,419
to an automatic 1 and this is what turns
into fascism in the flesh

66
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:24,460
is on tool that converts any

67
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,640
classifying to another on equivalent one

68
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,230
that is made only on and many characters
and

69
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,140
why because as I said and I don't

70
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,380
different things that come into play
anything first

71
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,700
with Jason be an attacker can control
the first bikes

72
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,890
made a call back from and second

73
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,200
flash fines have this particular
peculiar

74
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,180
implementations emerging policy so Heath
you can upload a flash time to a domain

75
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,290
and that splash 5 can do

76
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,970
out indicated requests a domain which
means kooky carrying

77
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,450
with cookies right can read to the
inquest and can also expand trade

78
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,590
that resides too and it happened to me
and this is by design

79
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,890
right we want to achieve is to

80
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,220
and have this we dollars a allowing a
new

81
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,460
user is not allowed to upload flight
five on that domain

82
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,100
to wear using and his Indian Point to
reflect

83
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,139
a flash fine because

84
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,639
the flesh parser is actually very
liberal and discards

85
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,300
everything and did it comes after a
violent clash fine

86
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,979
so we just need to control the beginning
a response and that's exactly what

87
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:36,900
season peas

88
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,550
be allows an attacker to specify the
first bites but we need to get america

89
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,189
right

90
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:46,090
so if we just create an HTML page

91
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,189
on packard a calm with an object had
went

92
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:53,629
content-type: and
application/x-shockwave-flash

93
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:56,860
and testifying vicuna com

94
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,870
flash is Indian Point call back the
flash mine

95
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,379
it's exactly equivalent to having that
flash file posted:

96
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:11,830
on the team yeah he said normally
flashlights and binary

97
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,639
and how is it possible to make to much
for americans

98
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,990
kinda magic at well

99
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,000
it's possible with compression and not
really would normal compression but by

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,319
I'm using compression

101
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,710
so fresh pies can be uncompressed or
compressed

102
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,050
in two different ways actually went we
see but first

103
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,199
this is a bad flash file and is made
just the

104
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,729
asking of America actually and it is a
rickroll

105
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:43,419
at I'm and would love to show it to you

106
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:46,750
right now let's at actually I
accidentally this with Adobe and the

107
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,610
fixed-bed

108
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,389
but not only that at a few and have an
anti-virus software

109
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:55,529
and you visit dad it gets blacked

110
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:59,189
because the added a recall to their by
virus definitions

111
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:03,469
and sometimes the same w32

112
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:06,639
not sure why Trojan rick rolled

113
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,009
tell this is just how antivirus vendor

114
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:18,319
work right yes management

115
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,260
so

116
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,680
they're supposed to get to know me
between a common attack on the comp

117
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,080
so the Yukon has a vulnerable

118
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,180
well working as intended at isn't the
end point

119
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,550
than just reflect the combat credit is
PHP mostly because PHP

120
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,630
s single to right I don't love his
Piemonte and

121
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,090
this just checked that it gets cold make
is just and made of

122
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,300
as America and underscore which is s
clash

123
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,479
W in the expression and it reflected

124
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:51,830
by dads apprentices open

125
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:57,310
brackets stuff that an attacker

126
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,050
can add on his militias page on acted
upon and object type

127
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,580
application/x-shockwave-flash

128
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,150
and data make him to complement his MP

129
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,030
call back any other American flash file
right

130
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,020
so the gym pinpoint where fact yet in
america cash price

131
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,740
into the and bras with think it is a bad

132
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,470
flash fire because we forced me
application/x-shockwave-flash

133
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,669
content-type: with the object that and

134
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:27,830
want and we have some other and some
other lines in the fashionable sneakers

135
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,840
actually this is no longer every crumb

136
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,940
and this is a university traitor so this
is

137
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,060
arm very they say

138
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,110
weaponized in a way Picasa at where

139
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,080
and you can't display or URL you want to
access with the victims

140
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,580
contentious so with cookies and
everything and

141
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,580
where too eccentric aunt okay

142
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,940
so you need access to your other
variable denying the same domain and

143
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,070
11.2

144
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,190
performing a trick question

145
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,100
and exit rate at to control the amount
to which

146
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:06,270
post a variable index retreated and

147
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,000
on my data which is that under our
ceremony can execute

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,770
artery flashpoints home and develop

149
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,430
for example ActionScript was ready to
download and

150
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,680
almost already went modern web

151
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,580
have was or is vulnerable so

152
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,800
Julia when you too LinkedIn Twitter

153
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,750
everything and just because he used it
in here I didn't do anything wrong

154
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,790
just used isn't the end the combinations
oldest

155
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,030
things create a vulnerability he's
looking into were actually say

156
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,300
and because the already played a
mitigation

157
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,310
thinking that one day it might be
possible to have America french fries

158
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,790
and so they were very the prudent in
that

159
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,970
in particular I I'd like to to thank I
look

160
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,280
X is the security and who wrote a great

161
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,210
blog post about trying to achieve and
for america if I said was

162
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,790
registration from and it was like he
passed

163
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:09,010
Mexico and

164
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,490
Google in particular was have a normal
on important domains such as doctor

165
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,460
dubler counts

166
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,850
sorry counsel complex intricate opens
for example sweet particular an account

167
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,220
and books maps and

168
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,520
their or fixed and we see how

169
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,450
to a step back now an

170
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,750
this is basically how s

171
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,890
3 had it looks like there are three
types of

172
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,160
last price and Bresnan

173
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,860
zeal in compressed one and as a demo
compressed one

174
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,430
estimates are and some

175
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,760
for start minutes we've rivers FWS

176
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,270
or see for compressed it is compressed
wood sadly

177
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,050
or whether Z his Anthony as enemy but

178
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,700
at we can ignored uncompressed and the
estimate because we would focus on

179
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,110
sadly what is deadly as ellen is began
erupting over

180
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,710
late with a header and the check some
right for

181
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,340
integrity and was later if you are

182
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,970
into specifications you can read RFC

183
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,170
1951 and then you have to read one 950
which is

184
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,410
deflate because Billy Mays lynn says Pat

185
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,660
yes if they played with Heather so you
have to get back and read

186
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,780
and study deflate an want a good thing
is that

187
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,710
fresh pastas and very liberal so they
allow invalid field so pick something

188
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,300
that

189
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,300
and version few you can put like an
alphanumeric

190
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,860
character and accepted same for file an

191
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,520
and

192
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,610
well you don't have to put a very high
bite

193
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,030
as the rightmost beneath the most
significant one

194
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,830
and if used to have a very high one at
least in chrome

195
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,360
it would not executed because it but I'd
love you too much memory and then would

196
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,840
refuse to execute but thats

197
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,450
meaningful 20 which is fine for us and
he's in the lowest allowed

198
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,230
asking right eight would work right two
conflicting

199
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,300
0 and then you have that the data right

200
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,560
that incorporate also a check some so we

201
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,000
we want to make it completely of America
and we want to make the check some of

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,100
America to write

203
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,240
because it is part of a file

204
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,820
so we really senior we have levels up

205
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,330
at hits on me to write

206
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:38,000
as we want to create something to South
America and want to define inside it

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,420
at tables for the compressor

208
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,490
to make it up in america and the people
themselves

209
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,940
because they're in bed have to be an
American and the text on this

210
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,740
development

211
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,320
so it's be difficult it's a difficult
problem

212
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,920
so what has been deflated as two things
that the district saying ammunition and

213
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,830
between action

214
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:02,770
I really don't want to spend time on
details some deflate because I think it

215
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,250
the rooms and actually take away and it
from the future

216
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,540
and its but

217
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,510
feel free to ask me anything

218
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,510
whenever I beloved

219
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,380
so many existing has these hanan

220
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,450
soul these the first bite is basically

221
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,600
compression method and for that

222
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,750
that form its and therefore and

223
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,060
the the other formats: compression im

224
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,320
soul good news we can make the first

225
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,720
likes to meow enough in my character at

226
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,180
which is complaining for months over
someone on his age

227
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,980
is fine and its its

228
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:55,530
aid for compression method and the
second one is actually on

229
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,600
well I window but at its

230
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,860
works the second one is a little more
tricky because it's basically

231
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,370
I'll also a little bit like a check some
at it has to have a modernist

232
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,470
21 which is equal 0 together with the
with a bite before

233
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,940
soul I just one run on very simple
scripts to try to brute force the

234
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,780
possibilities

235
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,950
and it looks like H know what his H

236
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,560
and capital see is good it works

237
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,440
it's a bad million signature is one of
the very few action

238
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,070
that are bad so we gotta are sorted

239
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,250
so we have a values in the blender we
used to have a bad

240
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,980
Swetha Menon night because the Parsons
relax and now we have a

241
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,389
that in scene had a dan

242
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:46,379
he signed the lease deflate I can be
played -ism

243
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:49,860
up block compressor

244
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,800
so you have some roadblocks

245
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,779
and each block it can on the shotgun
right and has

246
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,860
the first met switches into last block
then we have

247
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,899
I thanks two minutes that's a

248
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:09,470
his dynamic have fun so he is best for
your own tables for water table is

249
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,689
favorite movies the specification is
medically something then translates

250
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:14,059
bites 200 might see

251
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:18,180
and is something that will be will use
bad distinct

252
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,350
always has to be done and have fun there
are some numbers and counters on the

253
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,889
number literal summer plans one got too
much into detail

254
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:31,050
and there are three tables at the most
important ones the first one data plans

255
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:36,449
a which says a translated the scold

256
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:40,149
to dat other called and then there

257
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:44,490
about two more and a reason and a block
okay

258
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,259
so we don't care about compression
actually what we're doing is mapping

259
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:52,439
a binary time to I'm

260
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:55,439
try to find that is made a lot more
restrictive

261
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:58,800
charset weekend the a compression right

262
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,579
and it has to be an inflation and
because we are in

263
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,059
basically reducing the entropy or much
the toss and

264
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,569
my at so we r actually using a
compressor

265
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,079
to inflate something this is already in
between

266
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:16,309
and but not only that

267
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,589
we also have with want to my problems

268
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:22,980
that creating I table people's

269
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,459
actually that work so the current that's
the out with american

270
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:31,910
and making sure that the check some
itself is

271
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,110
a thin mint the check some is a

272
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:42,910
on the uncompressed see file okay and
how to check some work it's another 30

273
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,029
to check some but I was in a very light
weight checks and it's not going on a

274
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:48,050
date so it's not like to see for example

275
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,760
it's just touring some to two bites a
bring sums

276
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,100
s1 and s2 to for every bite its

277
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,290
can also work as a rolling some so we
can be computed dynamic

278
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,980
right and for each bite you add you
aren't

279
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,370
for each bite me you add you might be to
the first run some

280
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:10,209
as one and then not s1 to s2 and s1 and
s2

281
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:15,630
are of course and modernise 6552 one
which is the largest prime

282
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:21,089
a less than 2 power 16 to

283
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:26,520
we want to make both s1 and s2 of
America

284
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,880
and we can quit control the original
uncompressed with flies

285
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,890
as if you remember I told you that the
fresh pasta ignores

286
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,970
any a train by at the end on a balanced
life

287
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,240
so we can append everybody want so

288
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,640
if we can we can exploit these
malleability to create

289
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,960
a Haydock tax on right

290
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,960
but what is them and

291
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,250
clinton the most clever way of doing
that so

292
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,860
just one way and tonight it would be
used is had a hike by

293
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,559
lead disney's at me for example so that
we overflew s1

294
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,419
saloon S one to the other in Merrick so

295
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,580
as america's usually and kinda no

296
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,720
might value my because the esteem so we
overthrow it

297
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,010
and then we add the first day changes
that one 21

298
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,529
just made s1

299
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:23,230
what we want to be like any be whenever

300
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,320
night dan want to to keep as one fixed

301
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,850
because we want to update us to and make
it and

302
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,200
or something american but we don't want
to awesome

303
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,590
change as one so up very simple went for
not changing this one is adding another

304
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,140
bites

305
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,750
because every time you gonna bite its at
less one 70

306
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:48,620
it as one doesn't change right c310

307
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,990
s2 becomes as to equal s2

308
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,000
plus s1 okay and

309
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,909
and and we can add another Delta we can
call that the two

310
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:03,059
and that medical guess

311
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,640
a the s2 want so it's actually pretty
easy with his

312
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,940
that's led technique to get anathema
jetsam

313
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,730
so

314
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,290
noted we know that we can and manipulate
the fire

315
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,930
to get a check some at how we wanted to
be

316
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,950
at we need to use Huffman to actually

317
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,250
at in cold and added to file: to be

318
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,530
as an american so to get and bites
binary mites

319
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:38,090
and just for them soul I use two
different in corners

320
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,510
and and dad

321
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,860
cranes for tables cultural cover mourner
and

322
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,100
d ass musically I don't you can say yes

323
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,250
so for example could 16 I

324
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,250
woodland to this means that cause 16
becomes

325
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,630
00 which is the first in lexicographic
order for a length to code

326
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,930
but anyway at DPS this

327
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,640
thing tales the compressor how he should

328
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,500
decompress but also the team itself has
to be of America

329
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,120
because it included so that was pretty
hard

330
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,200
twitchy know something

331
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,940
really really hard to achieve air

332
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,680
and we don't care about efficiency we
don't care about

333
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,780
functionality we just want something it
is valid and that generates

334
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,020
I'm can make buy so we need we care
about

335
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,640
the and these alignments what he called
the lines

336
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,200
so we want in a way you think kind of
poetry

337
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,610
at we once I and region

338
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,000
did every that beats after

339
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,110
aids bits it returns a character

340
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:56,130
if you cut there right so for example
sometimes I had to specify something in

341
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:56,820
the table

342
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,720
and dat and does not do anything just to
make

343
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,780
don't even attempt government okay
actually most of the people in the news

344
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:13,829
it's just to make it nothin

345
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:14,929
so this is how it looks

346
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:18,359
thanks to Frank Allen

347
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,299
anyway for this debugger would greatly
help me in

348
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:25,799
and developing this and if you don't
know Frank ellen is

349
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,269
one other job guys one from the creators
a job in

350
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:32,879
made RuntimeException the if you hold
their own

351
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:36,949
eclipse on rent an exception he sees me
people so

352
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:40,739
and you can see that began after the
Commons

353
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:44,399
you see that by in asking what it is
would you care about

354
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:48,019
is and making them and Munich and you
can even see it for example the first

355
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:48,359
one

356
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,589
is zero then is that the and

357
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:55,449
at oh yes or submit orders amid

358
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:58,459
sometimes it's an SB sometimes MSP so
sometimes

359
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:02,229
its it doesn't weird and

360
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:06,249
inside the plane are some things that I
am must be on to something sorry as pure

361
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:09,659
but anyway at use it for example we have

362
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:12,979
d 0 you p 0

363
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:16,009
right ends this is what it has

364
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:19,100
to do so

365
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,110
that many wrapping up am

366
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,809
we have a passenger and

367
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:30,320
and the signature is asking and that I'm

368
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,539
we have a motion and we can but with
everyone there soap but asking

369
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:36,659
that government and

370
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,990
way of Highland same busy daytime

371
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,799
wickets I'm gonna make thanks to the
tables and a texan

372
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,299
is up in america because we can
manipulate the original sci-fi

373
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:51,139
my adding bites at the Apple right two
leaders lead

374
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:57,690
and Delta that mitigation I'd like to
talk about

375
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,629
and mitigation because this is actually
and even kinda clear

376
00:23:02,629 --> 00:23:06,600
what is that so far good it's kinda

377
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,749
complex and I don't want to dive into
much into the details

378
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:13,809
but really feel free to ask me
everything especially

379
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,690
at the end if you want so and

380
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,080
it's very hard to mitigate this because
it simply nobody's fault

381
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,230
it's kinda confused deputies from and

382
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,309
so it's not an obvious point right

383
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:32,119
because that just four months and if
other browsers called

384
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:37,159
because month begins it's not website
operators fold

385
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,019
because Jason he was like that isn't the
supposed to to reflect the common

386
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,169
right so its I think was that is a great

387
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:47,860
example how combining several things
that work

388
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:53,150
as the should work can create I'm gonna
be

389
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,340
I contacted and on the

390
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,730
in May up 2014

391
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,240
when his government had a working

392
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,440
universal for possible and

393
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,549
and dayy

394
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:13,010
and who's this fix and

395
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,679
we should couldn't check but it was
pushed after

396
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,830
almost a month because they were with
the World Cup so

397
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,090
they were afraid of breaking yeah

398
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:28,330
Flash Player the man was with was a
princeton in south america everybody was

399
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,059
watching

400
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:33,220
and like with flash that final so I
understand that

401
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,840
priorities right so what it is checked
the first aid by to the fight

402
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,419
and if there is at least one

403
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:45,080
T's and P's allowed actor when she's

404
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,740
has transmission and thus we find his
missing a safe

405
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,980
and a further check otherwise it may
take the first 4k

406
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,929
on the fine and histories at least one
geez be disallowed character

407
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:00,429
the file is missing a safe otherwise
it's not in unsafe

408
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:05,110
and it's not executing it okay

409
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,660
these was not did was not enough

410
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:11,290
sordid jimmy is allowed to list was
basically the negation of

411
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,540
out on Merrick and point and underscore
buddies

412
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,590
too broad for most women want is a
pinpoint because

413
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,070
a lot on them for example allow the
dollar sign

414
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,480
because of deep wary and other thank C

415
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,650
just picked that Henry so

416
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,870
if you and door sign

417
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:35,650
to chill out hospital was at the flash
and you would bypass the kids

418
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,940
made easy but watching don't have to do
that there's our

419
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,510
slightly more subtle way of at

420
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,100
doing that it might explain something
that naturally occurs

421
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,290
in the response other isn't pinpoint
which is the premises

422
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,390
so after the call back there is always
deflected call but there is always an

423
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,260
open brent is

424
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,890
because the comment is a function make
so what you can do

425
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,590
and what is the last night on the flash
file if the least significant byte have

426
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,240
the checks on

427
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,530
but we decided that the texan you
control a texan

428
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,270
did not control the sex the texan so we
can me

429
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:14,340
on fishbein that as the last night has
an open parenthesis

430
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,380
we can and what can we do to do that

431
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,560
we would pass to the contact the flash
file except the last one

432
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,580
except the open tray this right which
would be

433
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:35,460
there in response so we would work
anyway and

434
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,010
sold in response to the full value sleep
I'll and

435
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:44,520
even more bypass the fix beneath him see
there is an open brent is this which is

436
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,650
isn't it is allowed

437
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:49,820
and it's not in the requested something
permit miso

438
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,520
women's to the fix was bypassed like
acting when I world

439
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,370
work into looking at that and still

440
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,760
there is a better way of fixing it and
this is the current one

441
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,210
and I don't have access to flash source
code

442
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,920
so I had to do it hard way

443
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,420
but likely the and symbols for the debug
conditions so

444
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:17,990
check header you know and person what is
that check injuries and byes

445
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:21,360
you can see that there was a fix for for
for as I here

446
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,470
so what is dental now it's much better
thing you're looking for content type

447
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,910
application/x-shockwave-flash

448
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,270
and if there is it was the same wat
dismiss

449
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,590
the content have returned by the server
because

450
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,620
and isn't he a response typically if an

451
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,280
be different Jason content-type: that is
all the region but would just be defined

452
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,790
the object

453
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:44,170
estimate time so you're forcing a
content-type okay

454
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,570
so it is natural to someone actually
returns application/x-shockwave-flash

455
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,360
its bernie is that it's legitimate
flashlight so this is a preliminary

456
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,090
check

457
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,540
then they're checking the first eight
nights

458
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:00,950
and if any bites is great 3-point and

459
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,390
0x 80 which is not asking dan okay

460
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,990
then 4k okay otherwise to see if it's
not executed

461
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:12,430
is much better because at they are not
physically blacklisting their kind what

462
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,380
we think in a way

463
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,399
right and this is much more robust

464
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:20,090
nothing presented this I sent thats

465
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,860
and gain right and we should talk about
medications

466
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,909
my website owners but actually

467
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:33,740
it's not enough this is not enough can
be not enough

468
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,850
to and do you think of

469
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,860
away in which and

470
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,700
something that is actually has at least
one bite which is

471
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,070
great sorry for them 0 recs eighty at

472
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,210
would feel the text

473
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,639
in a way can become

474
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:59,639
anything you need

475
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:02,639
make you think so you def a death

476
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:07,200
sequences might taken him for about two
seconds by

477
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,070
and site 21 seconds at

478
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,440
it can easily be that one of the two is
Lexie 0 for example

479
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,899
right and the other is something else so
if the G

480
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:21,009
the endpoint allows you to 32 characters
in the conduct

481
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:25,580
than him very easy but passed this
because for example I i

482
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,059
even with an accent it's like 30
something

483
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:32,350
so if need isn't the

484
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,779
and point allows it than we may pass it
and it works

485
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:39,179
right now and you may say

486
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,460
why should badges and p.m. point except
utf8

487
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,289
right but did you actually

488
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:51,090
I've seen in twenty percent okay

489
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,950
even in very important services

490
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,159
and nothing which but

491
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,570
the importance so what can

492
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:07,409
went website owners do to mitigate this
and because nobody would

493
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:10,779
not enough people will flat with patch
flash

494
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:14,320
made mostly because it's it's hard to
deal with the adoption

495
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,480
curve I mean that the vid curve for
Adobe Flash is

496
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,549
pretty and slow and that's because
Muslims

497
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:24,990
well its Heartland title katydid

498
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:29,129
to keep updated on Windows there are
software bundled

499
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:33,519
we'd flash update which make a lot of
people even send the user's

500
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,990
decide not updated because the that they
don't want to install McAfee for example

501
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:43,679
to get it mean that so what you can do
as a website owner you can

502
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,129
return competition attachment which
makes which forces the download

503
00:30:48,129 --> 00:30:51,779
apologies and P response which is but
the point with normal use

504
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:55,879
but it prevents begins to interpret and
execute

505
00:30:55,879 --> 00:31:00,330
at least since let the temple into

506
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,429
all you can do something

507
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:06,919
which is actually what most site online
and

508
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:12,240
but one promoter doing so Google
Facebook and also

509
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,080
rubin race me when he

510
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,170
they'll fix it this way to prevent an
empty comment

511
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:21,429
long make this before deflected combat
to be the Hollywood

512
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:24,169
and

513
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:27,119
make it not a valid classified because
he controlled the first nights

514
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,980
and you no longer count on his life even
space would be no

515
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:36,369
so even if you don't peace practical
matter the attack not work okay

516
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:40,580
and

517
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,220
you some cases X content able to sniff
sniff awesome prevents

518
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,269
like these for interpreting this as
flash not always

519
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:58,340
so this is not too bad

520
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,060
so and

521
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,750
the conclusion and I think this

522
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:10,730
a expedition technique that allows be
the next iteration of data access right

523
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:16,230
and emerging policy bypass and
demonstrates that it's not always easy

524
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,820
to blame comparability on sometime

525
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,700
it's very hard to see who's the
corporate up this at

526
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,450
its its mmm it could've been sold

527
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,940
at different stages like when parsing
the flesh by for example

528
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,090
at but you don't have to the owner asked

529
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,640
over restrict because otherwise it would
break legitimate left by so that was

530
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,870
and his main concern and that
understandable right at

531
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,960
by did black beans or two browsers might
put some bling bling

532
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,060
tricked content HX to refusing to
execute it content-type: is not

533
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:56,250
Shockwave Flash man and he would rather
have broken content types

534
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,220
I was with risers for example return
application up to opted stream

535
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,010
for flashlights so little break million
other things

536
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,050
or back because would say donors

537
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:10,570
once I donors good a prefix anything

538
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,970
too damn affected comment anything that
is ok or semantic component

539
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,360
at perfect comic

540
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,400
and and with this I'm

541
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,530
and I'm and I really hope to have a lot
of questions

542
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:40,150
them and an

543
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,370
no so Adobe fix that

544
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,880
what defense okay so eighth an

545
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,350
a that the flesh has this very moment
which is allow percent

546
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:54,560
right now it is restricted to america
and underscore in

547
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,660
dot sort like this it will not work
because

548
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:02,110
Adobe with refused to execute such a bad
place find it is made on the bus comes

549
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,170
right and it's a countless

550
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,250
aborn K but

551
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,550
if you for example utf8 accepting his
Indian Point

552
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,360
what you can do he is putting all

553
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,300
Valley two sequences Unicode in that
variable ultracet

554
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,910
and with what flashing gotten right

555
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:26,280
I mean the only thing that makes that
the making

556
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,900
not work is the fixed by I don't be and

557
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,090
by website owners by prefixing support
something to checked Facebook Google

558
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:34,800
Twitter

559
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,139
and that they no longer return

560
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:42,389
the wrong returned the call back now
anything before them but for example

561
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:46,829
some website do Aston

562
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:49,899
bytes and

563
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:53,690
possible LinkedIn decided not to predict
anything

564
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,769
but the added cotton's ni Heather

565
00:34:56,769 --> 00:35:00,930
which is enough modern browsers not for
old

566
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,489
and and then like credit card company

567
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:08,980
care I reported more than like

568
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,700
when you're but LinkedIn

569
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:18,109
replied I'm expressed deep

570
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:26,210
yeah

571
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,000
it's at the variable allowed charset

572
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,880
and if you put their for example I range
if they don't need

573
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,440
then you can rent in with generate
something that help

574
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,690
well it used to be he can be clicking on
very easily I mean it's just one line 0

575
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,030
but it does the putting a get it yes
exactly

576
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:50,260
I am NOT issues and I am responsible
decisions

577
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,190
said

578
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,910
well there's actually several cases
where it could be that

579
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,920
still a real phone ability so for
example at

580
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,200
I've been told that for some delude
movie

581
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,840
in three files looks like it's not
checking

582
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,910
doing the same checks 3 p.m. I asked if
I'd

583
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:17,040
which you can which you can inject at
the Continental movie call

584
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,730
that movie did you notice we find the Qt
if he didn't know

585
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:26,330
on flash and know what to do.

586
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,490
agent embed a flashlight at its

587
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,950
it looks like you can use it for having

588
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:37,380
for believing that something region
policy if you have such a scenario by

589
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,370
then you would have to have a vulnerable
flashlights

590
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:42,930
in the first place what this applies to
anything and everything

591
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:49,450
me

592
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:56,350
questions

593
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,930
okay so maybe even if you go to Miami
and

594
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,760
blog posts you suffers a clash the
persons on

595
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,960
and you see more so we'll see a little
bit more technical details

596
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,040
and also our receipts for deflate

597
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,380
are useful and ultimately read the code

598
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,960
I was at the proceeds go tell you my

599
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,660
you might learn a new fancy language to
and

600
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,830
and I'm pp its

601
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:29,070
not too complex post its because
something

602
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,320
I mean hardcoded management to comment
the code so

603
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,830
commented song

604
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:51,580
please

605
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,120
and no producing

606
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,210
because you can add artery content at
the end

607
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:00,290
to you really doesn't depend what was
there you couldn't heating

608
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,180
and you would eventually overflow it and
get to down to the value you want

609
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,410
its and on a competing and really you
just really

610
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:12,400
have to change when many everything else
works it's done

611
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,370
did also becomes was because that to
check some his

612
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:20,770
of D uncompress WI FIS which was mine it
was not asking for

613
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:30,350
so it the most iraqi

614
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:34,480
yes

615
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:34,690
thank you
