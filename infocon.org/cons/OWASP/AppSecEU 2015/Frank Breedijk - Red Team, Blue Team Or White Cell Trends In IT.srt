1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,520
debugger as well

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,310
and it's even know my plague to picture
of the new wood plank

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,730
and like and what i said im from maine
ek if you want to reach me my and my

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,980
details are on there

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,770
and so this talk is about

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,730
do you mean immune system but also
immune system as is found in other

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,610
animals

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:36,530
and how it really age to info security
and we can learn from it and basic

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,110
very basic in unison is the non-specific
immune system

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,120
it consists of two parts but first of
all it consists of barriers

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,469
and those barriers are things like our
skin

12
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:54,359
I will look a has pretty well as I would

13
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,440
if I didn't have any skin on but more
importantly I would get

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,640
infections very quickly hand and
probably be very painful for me

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,370
and but it's also things like our
stomach acid

16
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,120
which helps us in just stuff and the
Pacific arsenic

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,210
oil on our skin which also helps out

18
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,060
and keep out intruders and in a sense it
some way

19
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,680
me like our firewalls like a rich Asian
prevention systems are anti virus

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,170
and all the other stuff we've been doing
since

21
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,450
decades and

22
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,350
in the old-style in the all today is
that was really how we approach security

23
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,440
and we prosecute me an act get a hard
shell

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,570
a softer an also referred to as the M&M
model

25
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,870
and and that approach doesn't work
anymore and

26
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,340
and I guess with the higher amount of
security people here that that goes

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,430
without saying that

28
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,990
it's not to you to

29
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,340
it it's also due to how the world has
changed mission was the situation as it

30
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,700
was in the old days

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,390
you had a data center everything wasn't
within the walls and data center castle

32
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,270
and everything was hunky-dory and

33
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,459
we started outsourcing we're now in a
sweetie we use of her as a circus

34
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:19,170
which is more or less the same thing had
we use platform-as-a-service

35
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,349
are also we bring in our telephones to
work

36
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,329
and used to be landlines it used to be.
simple devices now they're

37
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:30,209
portable computer should people take to
mean take them into the network

38
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,430
take him out in the network again and

39
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,769
obviously when I'm at home when I mean
the comfort at my home

40
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:41,469
I want to be able to connect to
everything I can connect to when I mean

41
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:42,260
the OFT's

42
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,590
and speaking on those pesky and use

43
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,569
and they want to work in the offer still
want to work outside the office they

44
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,010
don't really want to experience a
different

45
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,090
so we need to have another connection
and then there's business partners

46
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,230
and I could be your developers offshore

47
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,379
it could be companies you do business
with Han

48
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,409
whatever if you need to exchange data
there's probably a link there

49
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:12,810
of course we ever end users interacting
with our when a web server show were an

50
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,319
doing some other interaction and there's

51
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,969
things like the Internet of Things it's
no longer just my phone that has an IP

52
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:20,540
address

53
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,370
it's my watch it's my Fitbit might be to
solve some issues accrued might be my

54
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,720
refrigerator trying to be intelligent
and

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,250
ordering the food I've even heard some
rumors about

56
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,900
IP connected toilet this morning show

57
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,650
yeah the I guess hatched and what has
appeared from it may not be something

58
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,199
that appeals to us

59
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,509
instantaneously talking about the bank

60
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,370
we're actually not that good in making

61
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,159
good excels we're still fighting
cross-site scripting

62
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:59,459
and an hour almost binding as long cross
escaping as long as I've been in for a

63
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,319
sec for money

64
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,599
now for the next five I have to
apologize to you

65
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,269
my friends of mine who are in a red team
and you are doing good work

66
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:14,609
but to be honest with a red team were
now

67
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:17,880
who wrapped in blue team approach when
now

68
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,759
chest proving that if you take a knack

69
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,320
and you drop it you can break the shell
and then with the blue team that wraps

70
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,940
up the ag a little bit better

71
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,000
and directing that smash it a little bit
harder and 19

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,230
in a little bit better and Iraq teen
especially it a little bit harder

73
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,550
and in the end this is a battle that was
never going to stop

74
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,660
there is a time there is a place for red
teaming but it isn't

75
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,470
the single solution and this is where we
can really learn from

76
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,780
from nature because you must not have
have have a hard shell

77
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,160
Derek they're not wrapped in bubble wrap
except the sport look at here

78
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,800
hanan you must ingest part of their
environment

79
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,050
we just can't we just had lunch was a
good lunch do I know what's in it

80
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,100
no do I trust my body to handle it

81
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,890
yep pretty much and human stem cells
interacting funny ways as well

82
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,450
shaking hands with someone you and don't
like to go any further than that but use

83
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,870
your imagination up with other
interactions you have

84
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,910
not all of them are that's safe if you
look at them

85
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,150
particular bacteria logic and

86
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,980
to be honest but we do get sick we don't
get sick that often

87
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,729
and we manage not to diet a whole lot of
times

88
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:42,370
and that's because of our immune system
and it's not just because the parish

89
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,140
barriers are just a part of it an
apartment is

90
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,540
is about Arnesen responders Anderson

91
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,650
immediate first response and that's
information minute you have a wound

92
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,640
against inflamed the temperature rises

93
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,220
their increased blood flow to the
parents mechanism to

94
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,620
cat materials there to repair the
problem

95
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,320
also it means of making it a little bit
harder for the attacker

96
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,120
now contrary to the myth that Star Trek
started you don't get

97
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,669
read a virus in your body chest because
you get a fever

98
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,570
it just slows it down its other parts
that get rid of the virus

99
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,660
and but it doesn't help

100
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,360
slow the virus down and then the real
fire

101
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,080
it does come in and those are your
phagocyte Daniel white

102
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,530
there there a specific kind I blood cell
and what fight decides to do is

103
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,680
is they have a general idea when
wireless looks like

104
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,290
wanna material looks like to go hunting

105
00:06:45,290 --> 00:07:05,520
in ago if accepted and mister what it
looks like

106
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,600
we freaks containment and we're ready
heading straight

107
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:17,410
and your honor ability

108
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,710
has almost been patched this is this is
one incident response like

109
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,830
looks like actually this is what it
feels like this one goes on in your body

110
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,110
it's awesome and you don't even see it
because you mean microscope to look at

111
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:38,670
and so so it's comparable to what we do
an incident response but but there's a

112
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,690
part that we're missing and to
understand the part that we missing we

113
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,490
need to look at this picture

114
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,150
%uh how do you mean system works so on
the

115
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,550
top left there you you have your
antibodies or antigens which are your

116
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,310
foreign body part Park Center for into
your body

117
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,080
sorry firm body parts or something else
and and and there you can buy a white

118
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,550
cell

119
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,040
and one white cell does is when eats an
anti Jan

120
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,490
in represents a receptor on the outside

121
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,820
and that receptors man its

122
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,930
represented to other white blood cells

123
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:20,960
and AR T&B lymphocyte and what they do
is they

124
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,950
look at how that funny bit at sticking
out there is is

125
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,660
formed Jen create something that really
fits to it

126
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,110
and put that

127
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,630
on their outside I'm not a by
multi-party very quickly

128
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,090
and then release those funny bits that
fit on

129
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,130
on the morning so to speak of your
entire Jan and released in your

130
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,820
bloodstream

131
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,670
they attach state twisted around
something funny happens to DNA

132
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:56,680
of the antigen and induct thats
b-lymphocytes the T lymphocytes to

133
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,160
something very similar

134
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,120
but De Luca infected cells when the show
was in fact that it's also

135
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,400
representing these receptors outside
again

136
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,220
it will create fitting part but it will
kill a whole effect itself it's like

137
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,130
shutting down

138
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:15,009
virus infected computer

139
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:18,319
show antibodies hand

140
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:21,720
effector cells really fit vulnerability
that you just found

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,829
but because you have antibodies in your

142
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:29,879
in your bloodstream constantly this is
why you only get

143
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:35,100
the smallpox want this is why all those
funny DC's you get as a kid you only get

144
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,550
two months

145
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,269
once you have them you have the
antibodies and the threat is neutralized

146
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:43,040
before it can get you to post a combined
award

147
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,249
washed down before it can hurt you and
that's really one of the good feedback

148
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:49,970
loop step

149
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,759
is in the immune system that I think
we're missing info security

150
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,620
and and the money for the feedback loops
there's things like paying

151
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,879
pain is a signal that that get sent to
your body

152
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,420
it's like that katusha leaning on it's
probably not a good idea

153
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,170
you might want to take your hand up but
also bad taste

154
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,009
fly when you're about to read is not
good for you and you have you moderate

155
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:15,600
loop which is like the creation of the
antibodies

156
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,160
and you have a long loop and that CF
machinery Lupien

157
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,120
yes Josh likes and Alexis a survival
isn't mandatory

158
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,120
actually it's good if every now and then
somebody dies and learn from their

159
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,680
mistakes

160
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,759
other part of health care

161
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,480
really cornerstone really how

162
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,699
the human race progress was the
discovery of antibiotics

163
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:44,529
now anti bionics are a great thing if
your body is not able to produce

164
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:48,759
a knife and handcuff Hans Hans

165
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,889
or sorry and up antibodies or is not

166
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:57,059
able to produce them quickly enough and

167
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,350
just to prevent you die you get a shot
of antibiotics henry became reenact

168
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,350
comes in place

169
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,550
very skilled but at least you have time
to

170
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,439
to survive and recovered a good bacteria
that were killed as well

171
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:14,889
so great story about how your body works

172
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:18,059
fascinating stuff but how does it relate
to in for a sec

173
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,759
why cassette we have our barriers that
things like firewalls and things like a

174
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,480
web application firewalls

175
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,379
like at most people here I have a
love-hate relationship that's

176
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:33,970
predominately hate but there's also some
love

177
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,189
and there's your intrusion prefect into
system

178
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:41,699
and their all based on minimizing your
exposure

179
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:47,170
what is in there cannot be attacked what
is blatantly

180
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,730
hand ill behavior what's blatantly a
virus

181
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:58,170
needs to get killed before it gets into
network I we get to lead the feedback

182
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:58,730
loops

183
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,800
to be honest the feedback loops that we
have

184
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,269
in a lot of production systems are way
way way way too slow

185
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:10,559
you got a developer writing some cologne
on his laptop

186
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,339
testing it locally yet to do yea it
works on my laptop's here

187
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,499
face you commit an

188
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:21,769
hopefully it gets picked up by some sort
of build system

189
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:26,319
which may or may not runs from unit test
on it and

190
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:30,339
in then gets test by functionality but
the Product Owner

191
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:34,980
and that product our

192
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,420
looks at what can I release him will
build up a big chunk of all the changes

193
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,179
that we're going to put in a release

194
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:45,199
now hopefully not really is going to be
put in some sort of accepted the

195
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,040
environment

196
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:56,120
went going to be pen test and that's
usually when the feedback loop apt

197
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,290
and it's great but

198
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,360
what part of the lemon is actually not
pasting that well

199
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,790
I don't know I don't know how was it was
it was it a change in May to cross-site

200
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,880
request forgery

201
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,180
tolkan was it the changes are made to be
as poss work field or or was it a dumb

202
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,130
idea to ask

203
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,310
forward the last four digits of your
phone number as has a password

204
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:18,170
I don't anymore but this sure wasn't
right

205
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,330
and everybody used ever learned

206
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,420
anybody or any animal anything

207
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:31,760
knows that quicker to feedback loop do
better learning a fact so

208
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,470
in InfoSec we need any info sakin
application security

209
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,470
in Anne build system we need quicker
feedback loops

210
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,480
red team is nice but a typical red team
exercised takes

211
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,600
days weeks even months we want something
that tells what did we do

212
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,490
wrong in this committee two day

213
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,860
and there's plenty of tools out there
ives I've seen a lot of members there

214
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,850
I'm not going to do a specific

215
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,150
plug anything specific home look at the
open source tools as well

216
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:09,030
and another big part of this when you
want to increase the speed of your

217
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,900
feedback loop

218
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,960
is subcomponents the code that you
didn't build

219
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,640
and where that he used to be in custom
software used to be five percent

220
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,420
10 percent used to be the compiler maybe

221
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,190
now eighty to ninety percent of all the
software that's pulled out there

222
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,270
the lines of code are actually not your
lines of code but I things like jQuery

223
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,560
that things like the open SSL libraries
there things like your web server

224
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,990
hand you should not use a normal
subcomponents

225
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,520
now the last keynote of today will
address that particular issue

226
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,810
so I'm not going to dive into into that
peer I'm going to dive into another that

227
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,770
and that's the weeks suck

228
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,900
have learning from others and and

229
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,090
its conferences like this when we can
really go

230
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,250
and share best practices what we can
learn

231
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,260
learn from what we've done well can
learn from what is not going well

232
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,490
and we need to do more peer reviews on
your code

233
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,190
it should actually be best practice for
you to check in your own car we have

234
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,350
great experience

235
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,310
when a model where we don't checking
around Howard it when the one developers

236
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,290
writes the cacld

237
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,520
create a pull request nap request is
actually

238
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,820
Poulin by another developer who does a
review ground if not all security not

239
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,360
all

240
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,160
application developers are security
people I really got like to get to that

241
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,720
stage and pessimistic if we'll ever get
there

242
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,780
because I know I suck as a programmer so
I guess that if I color to be simply

243
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,540
program

244
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,680
and I been taught a lesson in humility
written a you would be there

245
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,460
recently and if I can be proper prompt
and developer I can't expect a proper

246
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,340
from 10 to be a lover to be a true
security specialist

247
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,240
but they're simply not enough room for
us to review everything

248
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,420
include security in you in your Scrum
team

249
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,930
your agile team and and make sure that
they are dare with Sprint Planning that

250
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,640
they are there when you need up

251
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:17,930
but they're not coming to fix your
problem if they have to read your every

252
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,050
single change

253
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:25,950
this is the process they're going to use
sup

254
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,610
testing back to testing and that
feedback loop needs to be good

255
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,500
doctors probably never going to do that
again accepting this

256
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
there's a little movie I'm

257
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,610
learn from the failure mothers Darwin
Award is really a great instrument for

258
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,920
improving security

259
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,330
but also learn from good examples visit
conferences

260
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,460
develop methodologies that do work

261
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,680
asset we have incident response and I
compared it to you too

262
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,100
B&B be eating eating antibodies and

263
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,410
we ass security people and

264
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,980
to learn how to do incident response and
and last year we had

265
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,000
in a previous years two years before
2014

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,730
we had 021 hair on fire

267
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:21,880
and critical bugs that broke the entire
internet an 0 the hell over

268
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,360
in 2014 we actually had about six

269
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,460
47 some people had to deal with a of
dose types of incidents

270
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,070
so we really need to speed up incident
response that means we really need to

271
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,810
know what our software is built up

272
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:44,790
but we need to remember dat it's not
just about finding a flaw that could be

273
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,900
exploited

274
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,260
and and fixing that and demonstrating

275
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,940
hate you can break in here now we fix it
we

276
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,100
also need to do that close that feedback
loop

277
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,440
so what is that a feedback loop its

278
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,940
taking the knowledge that we've learned
from

279
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,860
analyzing the vulnerability from how the
wrong her ability as affected us

280
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,020
and taking it into our web system

281
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,920
saying pay for now I need more time but
also putting it into unit test

282
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,450
hand shorten that feedback loop to our
developers

283
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,650
so

284
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,490
quick question who knows what this
signature works against

285
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:33,200
to personal check Intermap

286
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,130
IPS signature anybody

287
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,659
yeah shell-shocked this was indeed
shell-shocked now leaving out in there

288
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:45,690
is going to lead to false positives

289
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,110
it's going to hurt me lets them just
like a shot of antibiotics is going to

290
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,850
hurt but it's a

291
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,720
pretty good band a stops me from
bleeding stops

292
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,120
other germs from getting in and gives me
time to actually patch

293
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,110
to figure out where I'm actually
bleeding where I'm actually what the

294
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,460
underlying issue s

295
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,480
the underlying issues I've taken from
example

296
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,779
I am one of the things we do at you but
for those that we build our images for a

297
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:13,399
cloud

298
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:17,580
phi and automated process brian jenkins
and we actually put in

299
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,090
unit test hussein whenever we deploy a
new machine whenever we create a new

300
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:22,679
template

301
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,460
it shall never be vulnerable to chill
shock again this is the this is the unit

302
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,710
test and I realize this is not a Retina
screen totally hard to read

303
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,240
but PIB it's really and had CandyShell
strings that were there

304
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,169
to say hey is this a machine have I
created a machine that this phone ruble

305
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:43,929
to shop shop

306
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:47,049
another practical example

307
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:52,659
hand I me too now this is Annie

308
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:56,320
test that we put in two weeks we create
a a porthole

309
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,010
where we have to work with authenticate
an unauthenticated users

310
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,770
and this is attached unit cast where we
go

311
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,860
first ball what's logout from the web
page

312
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,570
and see if we trying to get anything
from this web page

313
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,270
it should fail if we try to put anything
should fail if we try to post

314
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,679
patch only need anything it should fail
then the next thing we knew is that we

315
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,100
set up a user

316
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,350
hole that mean in this case where de

317
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,580
free from Ilya password not worried
thats testator am

318
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,270
logout login and see okay can we we need

319
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,380
this URL it should be okay if we try to
put it should be unauthorized

320
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,649
analyst here is very long but we do put

321
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:43,919
this in every API endpoint we write
though she detests

322
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,620
actually write oceania test first and
then we implementing apie

323
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,850
and point

324
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:55,700
to see that we never ever going to
create an endpoint that will allow

325
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:02,289
unauthorized access and is another
example provided by a colleague of mine

326
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:05,490
which has to do with cross-site request
forgery your tickets

327
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,029
hand here's a bit of code that does the
cross-site request forgery ticket

328
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:14,970
pan I don't need to explain what a
cross-site request forgery to get this

329
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,110
here I hope if I do our has

330
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,610
actual documentation on it but

331
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,049
this is the code and this is actually

332
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:30,440
just a little snippet of the unit test
and again what we're trying to do here

333
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,250
is trying to get a request

334
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,240
saying this request should be granted
but there's also

335
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,730
test cases there is actually 1 test case
where it says should be granted

336
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,620
and I think there's he test cases there
where it says

337
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,909
it should fail and that's really key
practice that we need to change

338
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:55,279
we need to look at negative space you
need to learn to look at and negative

339
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:55,950
space

340
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,899
as well as the positive space for unit
test do we see defaced

341
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:04,639
order faces we see the face with a face
is facing the face

342
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:07,639
and it's really a new skill

343
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:11,500
cuz a lot of the testing that we do is
for functionality it's for

344
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,980
the positive space

345
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,090
and I mention antibiotics as well

346
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,580
every now and then I'm seeing

347
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,840
a number of examples today already but
every now and then

348
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,620
you come the cops a practice way simply
have to say now

349
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,680
some people

350
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,020
some things are just plain stupid and
you have to say

351
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,240
we're not going here and

352
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,230
every time security says no

353
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:54,020
remember you putting in knowing
innovation saying no too often make

354
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,790
security department now

355
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,930
and you don't want to be department now

356
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:03,830
but there are some resources where you
really really really want to have sign

357
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,280
of

358
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,980
from security and that's your crown
jewels those are part of your

359
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,910
infrastructure to show critical if

360
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,550
somebody changes MD always want to have
them reviewed

361
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,390
by securing and his waist to do it

362
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,780
I'm began using your favorite built all

363
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:27,690
we use Jenkins but there's others out
there as well put signatures on your

364
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,740
critical code

365
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,790
make sure thing don't get overloaded
nationally said that a while

366
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:36,820
now have a coat can CNN it's changed in
the signature doesn't man

367
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,630
that means the bill will fail jenkins
says no

368
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,490
to peer review

369
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,700
let to peer review worry sign the cold

370
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,190
check it back in and your bill should be
okay and that's a mechanism of not only

371
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,410
allowing this but also helping it to
make

372
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,900
wanted ball that for shooting partially
Co peer reviews actually

373
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,530
to happen so

374
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:08,530
that's where I learned is everything
will this fix all our problems

375
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,430
no it's not everything this info
security

376
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,500
and reality every now and then has

377
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:22,720
a little surprise for us

378
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,570
so to summarize why I think we need to
change what we need to change

379
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,590
is day something for a sec Highland when
a data center castle

380
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:37,520
have ended if you didn't realize that

381
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,920
that's okay survival is mandatory and

382
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,640
security needs to align our tools we
need to get

383
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,360
of InfoSec island we need to go towards
you and that's

384
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,500
that's why we're here that's why I try
to talk at heads

385
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,390
regular developer conference as well we
need to go towards you

386
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,120
and whole line with your tools the
toolset

387
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,550
you're used to to help you do your job
better

388
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,750
and I we need to act

389
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,650
really as the immune system that means
we need to

390
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,070
help stop blatantly offensive elements

391
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,570
if somebody's trying to trying to poo

392
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,830
more money course one in a pass were
he's probably not too good

393
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:29,000
or the security research and we need to
provide

394
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,260
early feedback to you guys said he know
what unit wrong Hawaii

395
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,550
why you get along why it is and hentai
pattern using another pattern

396
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:40,490
and we need to help clean up infections

397
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:46,760
and feedback into our resistance to make
sure that we don't BP's are all mistakes

398
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:52,210
now I'm really a big fan of deaf ups and
this is what

399
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,470
in a sense what the fuss is about it's
about

400
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,290
system thinking security is not an
island it's not a silo

401
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:05,320
it is part of a system and we need to
stop treating it

402
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,590
like it's something special yes it's a
special skill

403
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,840
no it's not a special department we need
to close our feedback loop

404
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,250
amplifier feedback want to make sure
that

405
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,490
if we do something stupid something will
prevent us

406
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,010
measure the hell out of it use those
measurements to prevent mistakes

407
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,760
and allow for experimentation were not
Department no

408
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,660
we should allow this experimentation to
happen security company bolted on hit

409
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,570
you build

410
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,340
in

411
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:41,519
and their friendship become normal
process I need internet always meant I'm

412
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,090
not an expert on antibiotics I'm not an
expert on the immune system

413
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,659
so I'm really really really like to
thank my friend

414
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:53,039
doctor jack I believe it or not this guy
used to be a colleague of mine and used

415
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,169
to be your registered

416
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:58,419
EDP auditor but we found out that he
likes medicine better and now are

417
00:26:58,419 --> 00:26:59,559
licensed MD

418
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,470
he's a good friend of mine hand given
that

419
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,600
his motto in life is that a dirty mind
enjoy forever dislike turned out pretty

420
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,210
10

421
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,970
so that was my message

422
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,990
it was shorter than I anticipated but

423
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,419
I really not going to make a lot of us
about it tell

424
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:32,130
again if you need to contact me this is
where I am reckon it

425
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,050
as this is some time for questions

426
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,540
I'm microphones in the room that makes
he said on the stand them so

427
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,540
misimpression is the to make for

428
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,290
what all wants icon

429
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,780
company but being that clear whose for

430
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,000
we're going to have some extra minutes
period the pic

431
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,530
session will continue the others as the
rooms as a

432
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,730
earlier today wanna remark their people
the

433
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,910
through to it. pitch printed of the
church either cause

434
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:07,510
freed up and that she court-approved the
hospital died lunch boxes

435
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,720
available for every rate sold which we
picked him up

436
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,230
so we have to give that save it was so
terrified all diets

437
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,530
stay kill which tera okay

438
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,780
the or not attitude and free and closure
that that would

439
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,440
lunch boxes so make sure you get a thank
you
