1
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,540
hit me through

2
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,710
the Sun thank you

3
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,100
shower thanks a lot and thank you guys
for coming

4
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,190
it seems you maybe have plans for
holidays to

5
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,480
a so let's see whether we can save that

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,410
I so I may miss to buy us some West
member and I also happen to be

7
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,989
that shuffleboard on

8
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,019
what I like to date to talk about

9
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:02,329
no first disclaimer okay

10
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:06,210
are you probably notice from television
all characters appearing in this work

11
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,190
%uh pictures

12
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:13,600
okay i any resemblance to real persons
living or dead is purely coincidental

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,090
a the views and opinions expressed in
this article are those just awful as I

14
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:19,899
just mime

15
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:24,070
okay I'm and everything I say is my own
personal opinion especially the wrong

16
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,789
once

17
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:28,909
so I we can have a discussion

18
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:32,970
don't believe me if you don't want to on

19
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,240
my background is I've been in for a sec
for a couple Yes No

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,960
I'm I did a lot of stuff in managing
application security so this is a little

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,820
bit from the

22
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,790
from the things let's say I have seen on
the road

23
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:52,100
I'm and at some point as well he
actually many you should write about it

24
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,540
i ish

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,979
given a little talk about this how how
things are going how how you'll

26
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:01,810
into acting in such a situation so

27
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,280
as I said this is purely fiction s

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,840
okay anthesis a this has never really
happened before and if you feel like

29
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,039
this might

30
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,160
some familiar to your organization this
is totally

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,440
just coincidental so

32
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,370
the beginning his son imagine you are

33
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,709
the chief information security officer
of a medium-size organization

34
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:29,049
and your thing you have this like a
really strong fortress

35
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:34,190
everything is going well are you are
well fortified you have secured the

36
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,319
primary tire

37
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,560
you have anti-virus you have firewalls

38
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,980
you have secure off-the-shelf software
systems custom I for customized for your

39
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,860
business needs

40
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,030
I'm a few buildings system applications
so stuff you build yourself

41
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,879
and million budget because you're doing
fine and you never had a breach

42
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,470
I'm not sure does that sound familiar
with anyone here

43
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,280
see some no way no way yes of course no
no no

44
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,530
until today so this would be a

45
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,709
this would be what you think maybe
author truth

46
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:13,150
and now the truth and truth you have
this

47
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,000
so every Chaput

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,329
suddenly you realize through my gosh
okay the hope early day yes that was the

49
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:22,470
night's fantasy

50
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,500
we have this nice firewall that protects
us against everything and then there are

51
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,889
these crazy people

52
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:32,519
called hackers I who take their secret
injection and they just pass right

53
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,359
through it and take da let me download a
whole database or something like this:

54
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:40,060
I'm actually not going into detail about

55
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,459
i holla breach happens but i wanna talk
about this

56
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,079
what happens after that and what you
will you make out of it all but you

57
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,230
don't make out of it

58
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,180
so

59
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,910
I I'm not sure whether you know the an
enormous says he's all

60
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,859
community so this would be a hello my
name is John Smith

61
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:07,269
I embassies of a medium-size company and
we had a breach

62
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:10,859
as a would-be hello Jong

63
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:14,459
thank you for sharing I'm

64
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,410
so you have the beach what happens next
for some while you're

65
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,620
executive management might get crazy
make give Michael a little bit upset

66
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,000
what happen right away

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,820
have this problem but I do have to talk
with the media why is the press calling

68
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,670
me suddenly

69
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,670
why do we have the security problem I
thought we hired you to solve all this

70
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,410
I'm you may feel a little penny coming
up

71
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,150
so you may feel like oh okay should I
start running or better hide somewhere

72
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,470
in the corner of your office

73
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,810
or what should we do with this and you
may feel a little broken

74
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,990
I am so you executive management team is

75
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,620
is getting upset the customer the white
this %uh because start calling you

76
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,950
I mean seven you receive calls from
people I mean only the security office

77
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,750
so pretty quiet shop actually I find

78
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,830
there %um he so confused they don't
really know what's going on you don't

79
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,669
have a mess it your company didn't have
a message before

80
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:17,690
because you never had a breach and
suddenly you're a CEO knows you by name

81
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,990
and has two on speed dial

82
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,990
I mean you may not have talk with this
guy for a long time but suddenly he

83
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,720
knows you very well and you kind of

84
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,060
daily updates weekly updates what's
going on

85
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,220
its I mean it's nice to be so popular

86
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,910
maybe maybe not I'm

87
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,010
so you get the pleasure of these of a
lot of communication

88
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,510
and what I wrote this a little bit from
the

89
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,000
personal perspective a

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,430
summer holiday now this may so imagine
this happened

91
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,080
yesterday like last week I like to go on
holiday

92
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,520
I don't know about you I'm soul may be a

93
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,540
you have planned for July there's a nice
beach somewhere waiting for you

94
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,550
maybe you want to bring some cocktails
but

95
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,760
if you come nao to you that you just
said you breach you talk to your CEO

96
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,440
he say all I wanna go on holiday well
that's all

97
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,030
sorry guys first you have to fix that

98
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,330
and to fix it you have to do this

99
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,360
do we have a security strategy can you
update it

100
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,570
at our security policy

101
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,280
update SCLC do we even have one

102
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,790
and if we have one kind of what do we
have to improve

103
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,880
how do we benchmarked against others
that's something people often like to

104
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,340
ask

105
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,310
do you do we have a risk management this
he read about risk management you know

106
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,440
when when you kind of care when you hit
them

107
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,820
the media you'll see also I'll some
jealous said although they should apply

108
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,060
risk management or no clue what's what's
this what we have to do for that

109
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,250
I'm do we have a security

110
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,449
maybe it's just you but this year
suddenly feels like kind of generous and

111
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,030
let's try a couple of people

112
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,300
just to make the pain go away so many
left something when I look at

113
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,150
as security training already I we have
to spend he was awareness training

114
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:17,260
somewhere sometimes I think five years
ago some people took it

115
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,389
yeah so you may need to update the whole
training you need to roll out a training

116
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:22,270
program

117
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,500
secure coding guidelines for the people
who write the stuff in your company

118
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,190
so just from like the top of your head

119
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,250
after the beach this would be things you
would be looking at doing

120
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,400
and like kind of by yesterday

121
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,520
I mean you don't really want to have
these

122
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,110
intensive conversations every few days

123
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,560
at some point you need to show a certain
movement

124
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,870
in motion sale home

125
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,810
this is the longest I'm not sure about
you but how long it would you think this

126
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,590
will take

127
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,039
yes yeah

128
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,520
yes is a good bet yep that better be my
first inning to

129
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,889
so there goes your holiday O'Kane I mean
you can going on holiday in two years

130
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,400
time maybe if you do all this

131
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,750
I'm I mean the people who know me

132
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,479
I know I have a tendency to be a little
bit lazy and I don't like

133
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,940
long solutions so much rather prefer
something that works fast

134
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,400
if I kept so i thought okay that's what
kind of how can we make this shorter

135
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,409
or how can we make this easier less
painful so the good thing

136
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,459
yes you are not alone there's a lot of
people out there who have the same

137
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:38,050
problem

138
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,419
maybe they didn't get a breach last week
but

139
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,230
maybe they got a CEO who reads the
newspaper about your company

140
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,550
having a breach and was known overs to
and suddenly all the people want to

141
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,970
improve their security

142
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:57,709
so the question is how do you get all
that stuff make it yourself

143
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:00,730
make everything yourself yes use this

144
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,779
list I think I have quite accurate
estimate I have no chance to get there

145
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,120
in time for your holiday

146
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:14,509
not even close so one of the things you
could think about is

147
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:20,009
I'll well known and copy from the
experts there's this crazy organization

148
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:23,930
of of a group of experts said and
everything they do is kind of open

149
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:24,910
source and free

150
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,709
much already heard of them I have many

151
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,180
to take a look Sol

152
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,480
arm this is kind of the list I mean

153
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,459
let's take one let's the take want
without

154
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:45,130
right from the beginning yesterday is
impossible okay I mean that's

155
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,509
yeah I next month highly highly unlikely

156
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,600
within three months you can get some
stuff

157
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,620
actually you will see it depends on what
your

158
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,889
expectations are so you can get a lot of
quick wins

159
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:03,100
in a short time and then

160
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,120
you can get on holiday come back a and

161
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,920
to the finish the work afterwards
bedroom bed would be

162
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,819
and approach you can take so how can I O
wasp help you

163
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:17,579
I we have materials and tools Online

164
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:22,509
I if you've been here this morning in
the opening behalf over 40,000 people

165
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:24,269
around the world who can actually

166
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,050
are you could I ask you can really talk
with us I mean it's like

167
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,759

people so on

168
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,309
be happy to help and there's a lot of
ideas in a what's

169
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:38,699
one of the problems this

170
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:43,220
well let's go to the next page yeah else
like we have a lot of projects

171
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,699
as totally confusing and you don't
really know which one you wanna use

172
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:49,529
which one is good for your problem

173
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:53,319
I mean we have a list of 10 topics you
need to solve Nole

174
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:58,119
you don't have time to spend like three
weeks just scrubbing through the website

175
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:00,350
and thinking about what you could use

176
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,559
so yeah the

177
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,519
okay you see this is kind of the
projects are dropping in we have a lot

178
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,579
140

179
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,589
so I'm I'm gonna stop this at some point
because otherwise the summer take all

180
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:12,999
day

181
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:16,860
of course is not only about 20 wasp

182
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,809
I mean you don't need to copy only from
us there's other places as well where

183
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:21,309
you can

184
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:26,230
tall inspiration II sold 27,000 serious

185
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,709
I'm there's some risk management stuff
mister a CFA and so on

186
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:36,600
and I'm a fan of copy you know if you
see something good I don't care where

187
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,319
it's coming from

188
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:42,749
I take it I mean if it's a lot for if
they release it as open source or

189
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:47,889
with an open license this is a little
bit how are you with frameless to your

190
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:49,419
boss to your CEO

191
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:54,509
so often see also come with okay this
people process and technology framework

192
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:57,999
okay how does this fit in your
comprehensive solution

193
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:01,939
so you would think about okay training
is for your people

194
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:06,699
organization we hire some people I how
how do we set up our team

195
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:09,739
process risk management process again
yep

196
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:13,269
and I still see some menu unique what

197
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:17,459
help guidelines verification and then
you in when I have some tools

198
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,899
so this is how you can find this to your
to your boss

199
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:26,910
kinda easy so this is the list of things
that I found useful

200
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,269
when Kong being confronted with such a
situation

201
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:33,730
you gave you see all who's kind of the

202
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,350
never saw you God get chief information
security officer who once

203
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,089
progress in all our well maybe he was
for his next year but you could actually

204
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:46,910
deliver progress now

205
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,050
and a good thing is all over this is
free so you just have to read it

206
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,650
so this is like their basic not mad
about stuff that you can do

207
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,580
I'm speeding a little bit because this
is a hectic 6 situation

208
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,660
so you are you are sitting in your
office and

209
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,500
you have to think about what you do next
by a XC end of the day because you have

210
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,960
to reply again to your CEO was asking
what did you do today

211
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,160
so the first one is Sasha

212
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,470
maybe you wanna know where you are how
bad of thanks and your company

213
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,920
on how do we benchmark want to go wall

214
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,010
are so for this senate Majority
motherless goat

215
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:29,840
you haven't you can spend a lot of time
reviewing existing models

216
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,630
there's like plenty of mothers out there
a lot of opportunity to choose from

217
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,050
you can actually spend like weeks just
assessing the models that are out there

218
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,940
in choosing which one your car we don't
you wanna go with

219
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,010
I like cm am

220
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,730
i mean here's like two things that I
kind of just put their

221
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,670
as an example like the same I think it's
a very sophisticated very detailed

222
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,630
it's quite nice and open sandwich be
happy at all last time

223
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,750
actually there was a great workshop
yesterday and there's also a team

224
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,990
the right here at was at the moment at
the conference

225
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,350
so challenges from December

226
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,350
hundreds of pages is unlikely you gonna
make it to your holiday

227
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:18,200
very unlikely if you go with this I
think the one your time frame is not

228
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,340
unrealistic

229
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,280
open Sam not so details

230
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,830
but I'm not so sophisticated brought so
you can actually get your first

231
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,970
assessment within a day

232
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,370
so you can read the stuff in a day and
then

233
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,280
make your first assessment so you get
the first results very very very fast

234
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,730
so maybe if you wanna go on holiday this
might be an easier choice

235
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,780
just a quick one so you see open Sams
quite busy

236
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,840
I we have to have to Maine's governance
construction

237
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,080
confections how you got the software
verification is how you tested

238
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,090
deployment is how are you deployed

239
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,450
pretty simple and you basically just
assess on

240
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,100
on three dimension at 13 elements of
each dimension

241
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,250
with a few simple questions and you
either say yes no and then you get a

242
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,080
ranking 12

243
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,760
as your 123 so very easy

244
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,070
so okay stock

245
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,600
you gotta go first the maturity model
service s men benchmarking

246
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,710
first you based on next

247
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,380
awareness training obviously you have a
choice built

248
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,580
by or just do something if you have a
lot of money of course buying is nice

249
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,510
because you don't have to do the work

250
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,180
if you don't have so much money yet our
way maybe you have a long purchasing

251
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,040
process

252
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,190
maybe you just wanna start with
something you can get for free

253
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,120
when it happens to be there is a lot of
stuff from Oostburg

254
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,810
other websites first of all as you all
know I'm

255
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,330
arrest top 10 super easy so

256
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,040
Irish in 2013

257
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,030
that's roughly you can have a 1.5 our
presentation like 90 minutes

258
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:11,220
super easy out of the box ready to go
and you also evident different language

259
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,730
just maybe a global company

260
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,970
and there's also some people called

261
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,980
it's important to remember it's beyond
this more than 10

262
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,380
and let me help you if she does he or I
saw ski you okay why do you choose this

263
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,030
actually external standards are
referring to last octet so it's a good

264
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,690
could make spending by you choose that
I'm

265
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,030
it also have sometimes for our managers

266
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,850
me they tend to even understand they
tend to understand the two interestingly

267
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,960
I

268
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,750
I recommend to tailored for your
organization

269
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,360
which may be takes a day so what you
would do issue you saw was to 10

270
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,360
then you adjusted to your security it's
a situation like

271
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,520
what was your latest breach a which
application types to use on which topics

272
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,180
do you want to focus and which examples
to use

273
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,000
for for the presentation takes maybe

274
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,550
12 days to adjust you listen to the
presentation once or twice

275
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,589
takes maybe two or three hours and then
you goal

276
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:21,550
and give it internally yes side it was
available online

277
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,120
so it's a slight headache it's a PDF and
it's on our wiki

278
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,950
so we actually have like everything for
that on

279
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,550
I would say this is probably the most
you must

280
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:39,400
project from all lost by Paul but it
goes beyond that I mean so you have to

281
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,760
first presentation for the rawness
training

282
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,920
then many wanna talk yeah you want to
teach a developer tool a bit deeper

283
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,450
so we have cheat sheets many a developer
of okay yeah I heard we should not do

284
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,230
the sequel injection thingy

285
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,460
so how do we not do that okay

286
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,770
we have a cheat sheet here with this and
that we talk again

287
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,690
because you don't wanna go and discuss
with every developer how it's

288
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,770
locked up or how it's better to so

289
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,940
just emmons the cheat sheet and talk
with them afterwards if they still have

290
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,960
questions

291
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,860
the same is true for a cross-site
scripting and all kind of a whole bunch

292
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,760
of problems

293
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,400
so you deflation just link me is CiCi's
into your arm

294
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,330
you can copy them into your internal web
page correct oversight

295
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,330
and say okay developers this is how you
do stuff

296
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,120
a we have secure coding practices

297
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,490
sorry babe beginning I mentioned maybe
you want to

298
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,340
I am set some standards for how you
write software in the organization

299
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,550
and you can spend actually weeks on
writing this

300
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:46,980
and you can analyze and think and then
you think about the different platforms

301
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,550
and

302
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,570
train wrecks that you gonna use or you
take the short wave

303
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:58,320
and you just use the Corp OWASP secure
coding best practices quick reference

304
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,690
guide

305
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,700
a very long name for super short
document

306
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,090
seventeen-page us again it's like you
take this

307
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,320
are you go through its cut out maybe
eight twenty thirty percent you cut out

308
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,280
because it's not relevant for you

309
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,350
put a company logo on top leave the late
Hall was preference at the bottom

310
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,490
and you have your company secure coding
put

311
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,800
guidelines okay one step closer to your
holiday

312
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,230
we're getting there I'm you may have
some security experts you actually wanna

313
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,440
practice an exercise so like a Champions

314
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,220
for that we have that court which is
like a broken-bat application

315
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,810
so of the people who did deal what's up
ten learning and all the stuff

316
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,510
they can actually practice and without
shooting your own applications

317
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:50,260
I of course be careful to not host
record on and productive server

318
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,040
okay overstuffed North well you see
stuff in the white

319
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,750
I'm yes oh this is the quick got this
name Bree you really should have chosen

320
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,690
a different name

321
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,280
secure coding practice was quick
reference guide

322
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,360
okay hun so you can II

323
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,090
you tempt I think you can boil this down
to about 10 pages maybe two of

324
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,410
which is short enough that nobody can
decline it

325
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,850
and long enough that everybody can get a
rough idea what they should do

326
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,910
of and you're done with that

327
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,800
okay checked by the way this is from
Boeing very kindly donated to all lost

328
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,919
so they develop this for themselves they
spend all the effort

329
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,230
so we don't have to I am

330
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,420
yeah you can use this internally but you
can also use this for example if you

331
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,530
have suppliers

332
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,920
SoC if you some other guys are working
for you in writing software for you

333
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,090
maybe you tell the only one suffered to
be secure

334
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,350
and they ask okay what do you mean
without course also for secure

335
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,350
yet but then it kind of gets fuzzy

336
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,700
and but this way you can say well

337
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,059
you write the software with this
guideline

338
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:05,129
and then we are okay and a few make a
mistake

339
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:08,499
if you break this it's your fault

340
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:12,590
if we didn't mention it okay then well
maybe we have to talk

341
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,190
I

342
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:22,139
the cheat sheet serious as I mentioned
before so we have CiCi's mean life or II

343
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:22,679
think

344
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,450
a lot nearly everything the teachers
have also been compiled in a book now

345
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,720
so it's quite quite convenient seen

346
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,940
clubs good actually I think I'm quite
good in time

347
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,059
I okay so wet course mismanagement

348
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:42,240
old gosh yes I this is what you see you
all once

349
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,610
we want risk management we want to
manage our risks

350
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,940
what can read all on can't

351
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,879
so make many before you start with this
one of the key question is why do you do

352
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:55,200
it

353
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,369
yes yes you read about it so that's a
very good reason to do stuff

354
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:03,460
and the second reason might be you wanna
do this because you want to decide how

355
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,070
much you need to invest where

356
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:09,090
so what do you do and how much because
you can spend

357
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,389
infinite amount of money on security
literally infinite

358
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:17,139
I solutions just the basic risk

359
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:20,539
actually this is one of those things
where you don't copping necessary from a

360
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,720
loss but you better copy from somewhere
else

361
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,879
we do half a risk assessment

362
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:31,039
methodology it was but it's not the
standard one and it's not the best one

363
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,340
so here for our first guests like as a
reference point

364
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,080
so we know what we're talking about
definition mostly used in the industry

365
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,549
is

366
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:44,340
printable frequency and probably
rectitude of future loss

367
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,259
so imagine simply example you playing
Russian roulette

368
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:52,210
you have a gun with six chambers one
bullet what's your probability

369
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,519
16 16 percent

370
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,700
I what's your magnitude of loss

371
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,019
wildlife yes if it's my life yet not yet
so it's quite quite that

372
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:09,200
yeah no holiday yes exactly if you are
out of the 16 percent

373
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,149
the holiday yes that that's no fun yeah
I

374
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:16,549
and also no future holidays I'm

375
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:20,759
so this is a very basic model you can
talk about many different dimensions of

376
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:21,499
that

377
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:25,210
there's a lot of different models out
there as a sub test the almost

378
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,620
rating and some others most of them are
kind of the same

379
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,850
so this is how we had all last great
risk but as I said this is a lot what I

380
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,559
reccommend

381
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,649
because this is the rating for the OS
top 10 I'll

382
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:41,899
more outside industry-wide are you look
at this

383
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:45,639
inside two organizations more like I so
2705

384
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:50,440
fear is the same model for this so

385
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,149
how do you start I mean if you start
with okay I have to do risk management

386
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:57,950
bug you just downloaded for example as a
2705 I think you need to pay like

387
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,330
seventy dollars for this

388
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,690
sorry I think you can afford it at least

389
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,529
after the heck yes to all your money you
should afford it now I'm

390
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:10,360
so you debasing the US side okay that's
a possibility that's a loss and then

391
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,549
they think about what's availability
issue have that frequency so how often

392
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:16,179
with someone tried to hack you

393
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:21,299
obviously more often than you thought
before I what's the business impact

394
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:26,159
Julia okay whole database going south
and what's the asset value

395
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,840
so this is actually a very easy simple

396
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,100
by way of thinking you just have to
apply it

397
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,249
quite basic so

398
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:39,909
I when you stop this you think about the
assets this is actually gonna take some

399
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:40,470
time

400
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:43,950
I mean inventory of assets this is gonna
take some time

401
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,659
but you quit and destroy all the basic
methodology

402
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:50,749
and then go on holiday why they
inventory I

403
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:54,440
and but do you get out of risk
management

404
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,450
what would your CEO want to see from you

405
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,649
before we all seem this like a basic
risky crap

406
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:05,889
green yellow red so it's red it's bad if
it's green it's good

407
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:08,970
%uh the basic correlation is

408
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,600
you have like a hoe

409
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,370
and impact so it's very likely

410
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,720
a know if it's I'm very unlikely and a
low-impact

411
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,919
you basically don't have to spend much
money on fixing we just ignore

412
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,190
but if it's very dark very likely up top

413
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,250
and very bad impact then you definitely
want to fix

414
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:32,899
so with this new look at all the
problems you have and then you assign

415
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:33,460
the risk

416
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,279
and then when you prioritize so yeah

417
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,129
can you do like a free sophisticated
risk management quickly eaten all

418
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:44,210
can you do a basic risk management
quickly

419
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:49,139
actually yes I mean the isometric 2705
is not a long document

420
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:53,269
and if you kind of skip through all the

421
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:57,289
blah blah it boils down very quickly to
justice

422
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:01,830
and you can you can probably get a risk
management

423
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,139
basic risk management up and running
within a couple of days as well

424
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:08,159
okay so

425
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,590
okay so we have policy we have spent a
gf risk management we have training

426
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,409
I'll up next 0 STOC who

427
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,500
all who all okay that's

428
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,580
that's a hard one because can be
organization didn't have one before

429
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,850
well maybe you had one but maybe it was
kind of

430
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,780
easy soul

431
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:35,700
well you can read up okay they lost
doesn't have but we do have some

432
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,990
SDLC the project that not a good one

433
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,690
if you want inspiration I would say a
very comprehensive list is from

434
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,580
Microsoft

435
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,390
and its public okay they they give this
away for free

436
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:54,070
you can you can read this yourself no
problem on

437
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,310
and if you don't like microsoft adobe
did a very good job took

438
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:02,120
so I'm you can take it from from them as
well in the end the content is quite

439
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,720
similar

440
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,700
it looks different on the graphics but
what they do is quite similar

441
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,690
however there is a challenge do remember
you want to go on holiday

442
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,330
introducing such a comprehensive STL is
a long long feat

443
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:20,790
so if you want to get ready on holiday

444
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,990
you cannot do everything and actually if
you are in any

445
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,470
of in any good state of mind

446
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:33,090
you wouldn't try everything right from
the beginning

447
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,340
what you do is you just cherry pick some
stuff this is like reading the menu of a

448
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,140
restaurant you don't buy every food
right at the beginning i mean you go

449
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,090
there first day you need something you
go second they had something else

450
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,120
so here again you just pick some stuff

451
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,600
that you think makes more sense for your
organization maybe you introduce some

452
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,400
training

453
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,390
I you have some security requirements
ignore the other stuff

454
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:58,430
maybe you will do some design
requirements

455
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,500
maybe introduce some static analysis if
you want to

456
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,260
incident response you definitely should
because he just had one

457
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,430
and you run your incident response

458
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:14,210
so you just pick a couple of things that
that stuff that sounds good to you at

459
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:14,960
this point

460
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,140
don't go with everything I mean took
Microsoft

461
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,780
more than a couple of years to do that
so I'm not then you can do this in a in

462
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,530
a couple of months

463
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,530
but actually you can ramp up your US
you'll see at least in process

464
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:33,680
also quickly if you will if you minimize
the steps you wanna take

465
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,599
so you can get a quick win

466
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:41,570
okay so cool SAT as well

467
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,359
tech I'm x1 security strategy that's
often a

468
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,429
a point like people ask okay what's
actually been a security threat she

469
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:53,879
harness that and I actually also kind of

470
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:58,399
I mean I have an idea what's in it and
I've written a couple of them

471
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:03,279
but the interpretation is quite
different depending on the company

472
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,599
however if you're not sure what should
be in it

473
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:09,710
we have a nice point we also have a nice
project for that

474
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,210
and which is the

475
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,450
or loss either got application security

476
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:20,190
guide for Caesars so there's actually a
chapter do in its

477
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:25,629
I how to write your security strategy
are the chapters like three pages so

478
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:26,080
it's

479
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,419
kind of high level but also like a
template so it's like that should be in

480
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:31,200
its and how would you get it like

481
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,599
lets you import and what's your output
so with that

482
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,759
I think you can buy the basic security
strategy like maybe five

483
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:44,849
I pagers quite quickly maybe ten I know
some organizations believe in that it's

484
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:48,919
good strategy needs to have like 150
pages so nobody reads it

485
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:53,789
II don't really subscribe to that I
think a good strategy is something

486
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:54,200
that's

487
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,710
concise clear and people will read it
because it's not overwhelming

488
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:03,989
sexy short skirt in some ways unless you
don't want to management to reach your

489
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:04,499
search

490
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:08,109
that's the difference I'm okay strategy

491
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:13,309
doc I am I i'm I would say I have
experience like writing a strategy based

492
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:14,889
on this template

493
00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:15,859
with in

494
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:19,210
within a week so yep

495
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,840
think that would be a fair target a

496
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,210
looking for some intelligence I mean
yours here we'll all probably also

497
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,950
karaoke why are we doing this and why
are we not doing this and what's why is

498
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,840
this important and can you don't give me
some day top

499
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,080
we need to make decisions based on data
and not just on a gut feeling

500
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,809
at least not based on this CEO's Cup
feeling

501
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:45,099
so I let's let's get some data when do
we get some date okay we can buy some

502
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:46,460
Gartner and

503
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,940
other reports these are you also a 150
pages or more

504
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,200
but quite expensive so you get a lot of
paper fall

505
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,799
lot of money I'm yes stewart

506
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,239
I if you have the budget go ahead if you
don't have the budget

507
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:04,599
all the rest has something for a tour we
have the air seal 7 a.m.

508
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,909
and you can get to be asked like over a
hundred caesar's

509
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:10,919
a like what they think it's the trends
and what's going on

510
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,999
so for example or you can report to you
see you are okay we see

511
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,489
external attacks on the right so we
actually have to focus on that more

512
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:23,619
I the inside of this kind of a little
bit overrated at least in the view of

513
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:28,879
a number of seasons now I'm what else

514
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:33,269
yeah are you can say they are what are
the main areas of risk for organizations

515
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:35,049
infrastructure application

516
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:40,369
so there's a certain temp a trend to go
there I'm compared to 12 months ago

517
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:44,369
with in which I asked you see change for
example they see okay applications seem

518
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,659
to be more at risk

519
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:50,719
nowadays than than before I mean we all
have a fire one also

520
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:53,859
I what are the top five sources of

521
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:57,399
I of risks within your organization lack
of awareness

522
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:01,589
inadequate testing lack of bed shared
staffing

523
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:05,789
so very basic things but you can
basically show okay missus

524
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:09,369
this is something this week later that
that you can use to justify

525
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:14,169
your next moves so you have your
strategy and now you also get the date

526
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:14,629
her

527
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:19,440
at 20 under I'm to put a foundation
under your strategy to

528
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,710
make a good argument make a good case I

529
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,419
yeah aspects of annual investments

530
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:30,750
so is it increasing decreasing that's
also helpful

531
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,720
sometimes sometimes co-stars why do we
have to increase our budget

532
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,850
to others increase the budget or can we
just say

533
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:41,200
then you can say okay actually nearly
half of the people are increasing the

534
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,780
budget

535
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,500
a

536
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,159
top priority its yep

537
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:53,909
spending of the security incident so we
just had one so

538
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:57,419
now its may be useful to think about
what other state after they had one

539
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:00,679
actually I found this one kinda funny
because

540
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:05,770
beef if you look at the statistics if
you look at the first one

541
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:09,730
is like the question okay are you
spending more of an incident

542
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,570
actually only 30 percent thought so of
the general population

543
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,880
but if you boil down and also I only
look at the people handle

544
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,650
who actually he experienced an incident
suddenly its overall Bihar

545
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:27,690
who know what they spent more so yes you
may live in dream

546
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,750
fantasyland and think oh no we're not
gonna spend more in small cup final

547
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,630
gonna fix it

548
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,700
and when you actually encounter this
situation you

549
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,510
you will see more people okay yet we
maybe didn't do enough before

550
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:44,130
okay

551
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,539
this is maybe also use for me because
%um guess you may say okay why did we

552
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,710
get into this situation so what are the

553
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:56,130
what are the challenges obviously it's
like skilled resources budget

554
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:00,000
but maybe also for us. here to talk
about the heck she

555
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,650
do we have enough management awareness I
mean Yes No

556
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:08,619
I have your attention I'm that maybe we
should have talked about this earlier

557
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:12,240
okay Sol

558
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,570
you have your maturity model you have
enough training materials

559
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,240
who introduce some basic risk management
you

560
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,440
happen especially if we didn't really do
much organizational design

561
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,700
we have a lot of training stuff if you
want to go into more depth

562
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,270
this is going to take more time so this
is not going to be done before your

563
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,830
holiday

564
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,659
this last bit so you can have develop a
training more deeper

565
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:40,879
materials and so on and testing soho
holly doing of

566
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,419
so this was this from the beginning
remember

567
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:47,619
so

568
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:53,309
strategy template way to upgrade your
security policy

569
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:56,929
I use to see the guide and you use the
coding got

570
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:01,480
SCLC take a look at Microsoft

571
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,349
pick some cherries and go with it
benchmark

572
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:08,799
open 7 take a look at this year so what
you wanna do

573
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:14,299
mismanagement five-day size at 2705

574
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:17,910
I security training and awareness

575
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:22,299
OS has loads of stuff for that I

576
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:27,309
secure coding guidelines the or less
secure coding quick reference guide site

577
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:28,819
this name is candy gonna

578
00:35:28,819 --> 00:35:32,190
okay as security team in organizing

579
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,930
well we have to leave some work at items
for you

580
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,200
okay I mean we come to everything so one
night and we left for you to do

581
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,539
okay for that then run this kind of
something you have to negotiate

582
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:48,690
anything three months yep

583
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:54,049
I think you can be the judge of it some
you can do maybe maybe I'm a little bit

584
00:35:54,049 --> 00:35:54,640
aggressive

585
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,589
are I tend to be aggressive yes

586
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:03,140
I college but I challenge you i think
you can do more than you think

587
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:08,480
if you really need to go and fast and
all the rest can be the source for you

588
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,260
to do that

589
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,980
its I show you I mean there's a lot of
stuff there you just have to nowhere and

590
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,119
pick the right stuff

591
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:19,609
sale all coming back with your holiday
be safe that something you will have to

592
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:21,000
think about when you're

593
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,869
spend the next said the issue had all
lost you look at the different

594
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:28,670
attracts you're here to the different
see the stalking

595
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,630
I hope you know I often feel like this

596
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:37,859
innocent and organizations like you
wrote first security and

597
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:40,180
you sometimes feel like people don't
really

598
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,470
understand what you wonder why they
don't appreciate the problem

599
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:47,809
I'm but maybe it can also help if you
like this

600
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:51,450
yeah so

601
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,640
with all the stuff I hope this was kind
of helpful I am

602
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,200
think about what all was tools do you
think would be useful

603
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,290
actually if you think you want something
let us know

604
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:06,190
or if you think you have something that
would be good for others

605
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:11,250
police donated to us or was this an open
platform so you can actually share

606
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,869
knowledge here I what would you like to
have in the future we can make new

607
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,030
