1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,950
my pleasure to introduce a Simon

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,110
fame and we'll talk about the said that

3
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,070
the at the I think your proxy you

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,740
can just see the slightly changer
between

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,960
the content and the tighter from the
conference brochure

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,250
but same and make some announcements on
the

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,510
new version offers up and some

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,710
was our stuff in their sting stuff so

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:47,460
I give the floor to Simon hi folks i
doing

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,600
right are my name is somebody's

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,329
I'm the project lead for as oath that
attack proxy

12
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:58,760
and all members themes in the security
not

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,710
brought my plan is to first give a quick
introduction to

14
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,020
sacked for people who don't know it very
well then I want to spend a little bit

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,420
longer talking about

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,750
the latest versions that which is 2.4 10

17
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,829
after that and i wanna talk about stuff
which is coming later

18
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:18,100
I what's unusual I don't normally talk
about things they going to do as a

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,649
poster

20
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:22,499
think they've already done so first a
couple questions for you

21
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:27,450
as anyone here used up love you that's
correct

22
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,429
and how he used and the latest version
2.4.0

23
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:36,569
a lot fewer to but update please update

24
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:40,200
I'll show you limit site

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,859
very quickly what is that I'm so and old
now

26
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:48,179
stopwatch on which I completely today so

27
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:51,529
what is that zap is a tool for finding
vulnerabilities

28
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:55,200
in web applications so it is it is a
hacking tool

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,200
it is completely free and open source
like all

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,499
those projects and his analyst flagship
project

31
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:05,789
so the flagship project so those are the
ones which most mature most suitable for

32
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:10,110
people to adopt and people been telling
me that sappy some

33
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,940
becoming better known and I think it's
some people tell me it's become as

34
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,630
well-known as the old top 10 now

35
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,459
which is a which is very good news to
come verify that butter

36
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:24,489
us impression level people telling so it
is a tool that is intended to be

37
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:27,440
ideal for beginners that's how it's to
start

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,110
heads up I was definitely begin to
myself and I want to learn about

39
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,420
an application security up so it's on we
still want to make sure it is a really

40
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,560
good tool for beginners

41
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,110
is also I'm being used a lot by security
professionals

42
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,440
so she try to get the whole range from
the Guinness right up to the pros

43
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,750
this also ideal for developers

44
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,500
and yet functional test as especially
force me to security test

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,360
not to talk about a lot to this time but
that I will be

46
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,040
I'll be mentioning to mention enough
talk about another talks apparently more

47
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,170
the devil tracks

48
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,460
on later on this afternoon someone's
talking about miss connelly mentioning

49
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,330
that a lot

50
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,710
right it is included in all major
security distractions like Cali

51
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,620
and it's been the top one or two in the
tools watch top security tools of the

52
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,380
last couple years which is really good

53
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,170
as of May and it's now on a thoughtful
its technology radar

54
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,260
which is really great so they're saying
that all businesses should be

55
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,430
evaluating Zack to see how well it can
work in that business

56
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,810
up but of course I should always mention
that Tina as

57
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,660
I'm sure you'll know in the security
business there are no silver bullets so

58
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,110
that certainly is one of those

59
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,640
so we do have some principles

60
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,790
which makes a little bit different from
some commercial projects it is free and

61
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,459
open source Java

62
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:47,310
as I've mentioned before I don't stress
tests and I want to stress that

63
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,330
there is no pro version that will never
be a pro version

64
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,690
and one of the reasons I stress that is
that is very much a community project

65
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,519
we actively want people to get involved
it is all about learning about security

66
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,070
and you can do that by using zap you
don't like it get learn about security

67
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,760
by

68
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,870
getting involved and actually making
changes in enhancing in seeing how's

69
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,970
that works in

70
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,739
going well this could work better and
and you know the thing that way

71
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:15,950
so and won the reasons I always stress
there be no pro version

72
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,060
is silly you know if you contribute to
that then

73
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,500
we won't take a hard working above thank
you very much you know we will now sell

74
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:22,850
us

75
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,030
we're not going to do that it is
cross-platform

76
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,800
and so you know all we need is Java 7
ab-soul run on all the main platforms I

77
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,440
even got it running arrest reply

78
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,539
Paso gonna was it that fast but to

79
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:36,790
it still worked

80
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,110
and we aim it to be easy to use now this
is some

81
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,850
there some caveats here security by
nature

82
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,250
is not exactly and obvious and

83
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,010
intuitive so a security tool will never
be completely obvious incomplete easy to

84
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,360
use

85
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,860
but we aim to make it as easy to use as
possible and thus not only for beginners

86
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,480
you know even

87
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,610
as I learn more more I still wanna tools
are used to

88
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,080
to be easy and intuitive and to help me
up

89
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,480
but that means that if you have problems
with sample the usability problems is at

90
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,910
then please report them

91
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,700
and we treat usability issues just too
seriously ass functional issues

92
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,290
and it's the easy to install as well

93
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,900
up I've played with a lot of security
tools and some other mass

94
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,940
such a complete nightmare with all the
dependencies and things

95
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,340
actually getting them up and running
combi up very difficult

96
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,890
and you know we try make sure that the
timing all you need is Java 7

97
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,090
and then it gets at running and the Mac
burned the shit she comes a Java 7 so

98
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,540
it's a

99
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,940
very straightforward it is
internationalizing again this is

100
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,450
very unusual for security tools
including commercial ones

101
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,720
us so it is completely International Ice
and

102
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,730
it is fully documented I

103
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,830
another caveat with that the
documentation is based been written by

104
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,570
the developers including myself

105
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,640
and you know what we not technical this
so the documentation could definitely

106
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,210
better

107
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,160
be better but there's a lot of
documentation around we have a user

108
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,650
guide

109
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,870
which included what's happened that's
also online with we just 'em

110
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,420
is in processing on that so it's earned
keaton step and there's a lot

111
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,690
information on the wiki

112
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,850
but yes there's still a lot of things we
could and should document document

113
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,480
better

114
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,930
we aim it does that to work well with
other tools

115
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,620
we know Zack isn't the be-all end-all to
try and make sure that we can

116
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,330
at contract with tools we can launch
tools and other tools can you stop

117
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,070
such very important for us and we're
very happy to make changes make that

118
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,620
easier

119
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,910
if it doesn't directly benefits at the
fact that we were Camilla tools not

120
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,040
total using us

121
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,870
is definite benefits so if you try to
use app into a similar tools you have

122
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,460
problems

123
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,160
let us know and we'll try to help out
and also be trying

124
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,720
reuse well-regarded components I'm so we
don't reinvent the wheel especially have

125
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,090
to

126
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,410
if we want to take really good open
source out there

127
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,540
and reuse it rather than you maintain
your own version

128
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,600
but you know we will do that in some
cases we created new things

129
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,400
and we've made components other tools
can use I'm someplace special delivery

130
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,300
license them so that they can be used by
commercial tools

131
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,990
so release is very important but the
week reuse things and that other two

132
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,240
people can reuse

133
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,780
stuff which generate some statistics for
you

134
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,160
us so that is nearly five years old a

135
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,910
so it's getting that and we did most
recent release 240 we released last

136
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,450
month

137
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,760
and just checked this morning that's
been downloaded more more than 32,000

138
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,270
times

139
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,270
June too bad in one month and that's
direct downloads as opposed to

140
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:36,080
they've done tools like Cali updated
very quickly so people using that to

141
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,750
Cali

142
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,220
will pull that down from the Cali I'm
repose from Alice

143
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,650
it is being translated into 30 languages

144
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,270
shipping is 31 now and it's got an email
from somebody else this morning saying I

145
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,990
would like to translate into another
language

146
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,230
which is really great a week 32 cents I
we got over 130 translators

147
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,620
%uh so that's something I'm really proud
of and something up things really great

148
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,810
and it's just a very important thing
we've done

149
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,750
we want contributions from it all all
aspect to this documentation translating

150
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,090
says not just coat contributions were
interested in

151
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,160
testing all the things up really great
at

152
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,480
hmmm not sure about this but I kinda get
the impression is actually much sleep

153
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,510
special pen test is using it I could be
wrong it's difficult for us to know

154
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,610
exactly is using it

155
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,300
but based on the trip the feedback we
getting some love

156
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,280
issues array some guess it's propane
testers but maybe it's just that the

157
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,860
boat sank you like people the fine it
does exactly what we need Marshall

158
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,339
and finally %ah attempt to this so much
pleased to see something say I was at

159
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:35,540
just focus Paris

160
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,660
I did some quick calculations in the
bush in the Wii release:

161
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,200
so 240 not including all stuff on the
marketplace I'm

162
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,380
only 20 percent of that is a ritual
Paris code in eighty percent is the zip

163
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,199
code

164
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:52,130
a few more statistics for you to the
site called open hop

165
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,790
and zack is counted as very high
activity on their asses actually right

166
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,209
up there with the Linux kernel

167
00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:02,160
and Firefox a so it is very active its
most active I was project on that

168
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,579
party type sixty coat contributors 31

169
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,649
in the are active so you take the
translators earned

170
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,660
and all the Evangelist we go over 200

171
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,449
contributors things really great
apparently took three hundred and forty

172
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:16,649
seven years an effort

173
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:20,339
not quite sure how to calculate that I'm
sure I'm done any more than the

174
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:30,480
a hundred years on it myself

175
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,240
so lusty gonna go through on the
introduction is to use cases

176
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,410
at that which want to make sure that can
be used as many different ways as

177
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,130
possible

178
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,970
and whatever's you know whatever works
for you really so you can use as a point

179
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,769
and shoot all

180
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:48,680
I in a dissenter URL and it'll go and
I'll spider that the insight and then do

181
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,040
the active and passive scanning

182
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,730
this works very well unless you got
something up authentication which case

183
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,060
it could be hitting the login page

184
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,360
so obviously there are some restrictions
that up

185
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,519
it would tend to recommend AC proxying
vise apso exploring the web application

186
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,670
manually

187
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,180
with your browser proxy trees up so you
can explore the application

188
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,730
you can put sensible values you can
explore hopefully the application site

189
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,500
for humans

190
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,529
and so you'll understand it and %um
stand it more as explore it

191
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:19,610
and you than teacher about it and the
bed US explore the application I bet is

192
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,529
that can scan it

193
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,620
and so manual proxying and scanning is a
very good step

194
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,190
obviously we got the manual 10 testing
so protesters

195
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,410
if that's just a starting point after
that there's loads a firm

196
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,470
manual tools to play around thanks it
way to turn professional pen testing you

197
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,130
want to automate as much as possible

198
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,730
so he can concentrate your money left
your brain power on the things that

199
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,839
automated scanners like that just can't
find but I also think

200
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,339
automated security regression tests a
very important aspect old

201
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:51,740
sap so this is where instead of having
somebody sitting there

202
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,079
& Expo on the application you use your
up automated

203
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,220
a your regression tests to explore your
application

204
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,390
so this is something you can actually
including a continuous integration

205
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,970
so you do all your functional tests
proxy info through the

206
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,550
it's true that you get a functional
testing and then zap can be security

207
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,630
regression testing on top of that 82 as
part of continuous integration it means

208
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,459
you know with enough minutes or hours
have someone actually committing a

209
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:18,360
change you can get an alert saying

210
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,300
there's now a cross-site scripting
vulnerability because someone fought for

211
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,740
got to skate one variable

212
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,699
on a web page so that scene on the
sooner we can catch these

213
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:26,920
vulnerabilities the better

214
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,550
you can actually use that as a debugger
and so on use that you know any playing

215
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,149
around with JavaScript libraries

216
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,459
or Web Sockets you know if you having
problems we have when you're developing

217
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:37,449
a website

218
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:41,170
and you will see what's going on he can
use app and to be funny are you sending

219
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:41,660
the wrong

220
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,760
you can change things mid-flight you
know but its Web Sockets or

221
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,250
even though with some the client-side
messages as well rockne she go and

222
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,440
change the code and recompiling redeploy
you can see it will just change on the

223
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,040
fly and make sure I get it right

224
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,500
then when is working okay then change
code the code and

225
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,590
go from there so what's up very
important and also

226
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,690
of the force that is in the be all and
end all and

227
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,160
there are a lot of the quite a few tools
is growing number of tools including

228
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,990
that threat fix a million

229
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,690
which have a wider scope than just
scanning individual web applications

230
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,260
and they make use of that very carefully
and so is a very important news case for

231
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:25,480
us

232
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,920
so what I'd like to do now is talk about

233
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,070
the latest versions that 240 and

234
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:45,319
rather just talk about it I think of
trying show you some other things

235
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:49,759
so this is a and if you haven't used
this version before you'll notice that

236
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,509
there was such a splash screen test you

237
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:54,639
Anderson tips and tricks that come up
and when you

238
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,119
in the splash screen he's read
unfortunate fact that she stopped about

239
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:01,439
think about half the speed to use to
answers

240
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:05,309
this twice as fast to start up and that
means is you don't have much time to

241
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:06,309
read the tips tricks

242
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:09,609
and you can access and other help many
as well then what you get

243
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:13,659
is this dialogue asking about what you
want persist this app session

244
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,409
I'm with done this because we found a
lot of people were

245
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:21,319
I starting at zap they would then
exploring that to get doing the tall the

246
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:22,059
pen testing

247
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:26,089
and then there was saving the results at
the end alyssa is a national best way to

248
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:26,759
use app

249
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,079
because what happens is at stores
everything it does in the database

250
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,569
and if you do not assisting the
obsession it will store to take place

251
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:34,199
anyway

252
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:38,379
but when used a if you choose not
assisted that database will get trashed

253
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:42,169
when you exits out when you've saved
will persist it

254
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:45,789
they actually gets copied to another
place so the most efficient the best way

255
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:46,549
to use app

256
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:49,749
is actually to persist persist the
session to start I'm

257
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:53,489
and that way if that unlikely event that
precious hope your PC crashes

258
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:57,869
that you actually have to be saved up to
that point and he say that he too low to

259
00:13:57,869 --> 00:13:59,209
work any fine actually is

260
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:04,649
in thousands all 10 2001 2000 request
when he say the session ashey copying

261
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:05,779
those files takes time

262
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,219
so the the best thing to do is she say
the session to start

263
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:12,749
so got two options you can say exactly
where you want to save it you can save

264
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:13,279
it new

265
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,139
them standard place for with the
timestamp or we can choose not save this

266
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:18,379
Talkster at all

267
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:23,079
and you can later on chest assisted and
have persisted it then you can actually

268
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,689
to the the session when you exit as well
if you'd like so that was the first

269
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:28,729
thing you must noticed

270
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:32,769
second thing is and now up kinda
hopefully can read

271
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:36,119
zapper the backup try to change the
resolution says bit clearer

272
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:39,239
and on usually have had a lower
resolution sexy more

273
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:43,259
up but one thing you'll notice is there
a lot fewer taps than they used to be

274
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:47,069
now don't worry we happen to got rid of
a lotta functionality

275
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:51,029
but we found is all the different ap San
options were quite intimidating to new

276
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:51,699
users

277
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:55,319
and we also found that even experienced
people using Sat

278
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:57,730
tended to use a particular

279
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,209
actions its up one time so they wouldn't
use everything that is concentrated

280
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:02,050
particular areas

281
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,300
and so this massive taps didn't help at
all so it's done if we try to cut it

282
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,019
down to the

283
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:11,050
absolutely essential and actually
normally script type

284
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,139
isn't what the ones which comes up say
it say it will be much more like that

285
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:18,339
and what you'll say is we have the set

286
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:22,500
magic plus icons and these are all the
other tabs that are available seeking

287
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:22,880
God

288
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,180
at any of these ones you like and we've
got a couple buttons here

289
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,620
so his a button which shows all taps so

290
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,730
pass a full set of taps you get as
default for two point

291
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,730
40 now that's and you know we got 'em

292
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,480
this app marketplace online marketplace
in pull-down loads and loads more

293
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,470
add-ons at but we also got another
option here for hiding in Pinetops

294
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,690
and that pinning thing is important
because say

295
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,800
you always want scripts tap so you could

296
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,029
at the script ap at or the taps that on
it

297
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:59,199
show but people capital Pinoy cone
decompn

298
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,540
and then it doesn't matter if you show
all the tabs and that hike the taps

299
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,550
that the pink ones are still state and
we're trying to do is make sure that

300
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,760
taps appear when required so what do

301
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:25,400
a quick attack

302
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:34,270
get the right Urol than you see

303
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:38,820
down there despite a tap appeared and an
active scant Apple here

304
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,190
so basin taps appear as and when
required six at a break point that you

305
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,210
get a break point ap

306
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,610
it's actually quite good because I
notice I was I'm exploring a web web

307
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,750
site in something the WebSocket staff
appeared

308
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,930
something makes it much more obvious
when these things happen

309
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,070
%uh so that's the taps and don't think
you might notice

310
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,780
is we have on the side street police
need to borrow and we've got context

311
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,560
there as well

312
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,160
and the reason we put context that is
actually very important

313
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,280
and us this question here how many
people here used contexts

314
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,290
a few but not very many

315
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,920
if you've not use context was at you
have use that very much

316
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,199
cuz theres context a very important than
ever important

317
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,150
because they allow us to but defining
and

318
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,810
different characteristics all of your
application so have a look here

319
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,130
what we can do is we can actually just
got on

320
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,140
once for importing exporting contacts
and we saw a new context

321
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,270
died okay and you can still Dept a
staunch tree and right-click

322
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,240
all those and to add them to the context
but what we can do

323
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,770
weekend in this way I'm good too defined
budget

324
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,270
as the context adult pics a sensible 9

325
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,290
and don't think so we've now got this
new

326
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,860
budget context and you see it's got the

327
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,270
foot tall guy called and that means it's
in scope so it actually

328
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,530
right click on the context and removed
from SCU

329
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,640
and added back in second do this very
quickly

330
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,880
and double click on the context them we
see

331
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,880
is to see all this extra information
that you turn actually associated with

332
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,660
the context

333
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,590
so context to the following bike set to
view or else you can

334
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,790
at you world happens at you can include
and exclude but I think a structure

335
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,600
so if you have a things like me unusual

336
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,220
parental units separators or view

337
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,960
at single-page applications this is
where you tell about your application

338
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,710
how it works

339
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,220
technology say if you actually know what
technologies behind your site

340
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,940
then you can tell that and that's very
good because you can save up for

341
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,669
we don't have you know it's running on
Windows is no point in doing jack shit

342
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:47,539
attacks on

343
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:50,600
then X amount so he can making

344
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,700
big support efficient North education
users

345
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,799
at you know if there's a lotta things
you can actually falling

346
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,590
to do with those applications so

347
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,260
contact is very important at school
reasons we've got those that up next on

348
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,059
talk about

349
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:10,620
%eh the scammed IOC's so this is how we
actually launch attacks

350
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,870
so we've had this up if you're that

351
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,539
various ways launch attacks at 10 send a
waste

352
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:21,020
right clicking on a node and you got
attacked up

353
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,059
I menu here and missus

354
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:27,860
what we're finding is we are putting
more and more options in this

355
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,679
attack many is getting bigger and bigger
and combinations getting awkward

356
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,390
so you see what we've got is powerful
force browser she still to do

357
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:39,080
on there just single items to make
things so a spider

358
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,270
bed we get you not we got it a dialogue
watched

359
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,750
aunt normally you want seeing advanced
up options

360
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,200
so you'll see is you just have a very
simple thing starting point

361
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,340
a it got multiple contacts he chooses at
if you to find a context the users then

362
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,900
actually changed much use your despite
arrest so the second unit do you want to

363
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,390
up Rica I have rehearsed down the
unknown nodes

364
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,750
so too to actually use those a starting
point selected spider just come the

365
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,970
sensual information

366
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,020
and if you're new to this app this is
you know that's all you need

367
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,240
had three up but what you can do is
you'll be

368
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,650
also options and then we go away Nextag
defining

369
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,390
loaded extra things so you know the
cruel death exactly what you know to

370
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,100
what actually

371
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,539
apostate meta-data lots have and more

372
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:31,679
advanced things which allowed choose the
spot exactly how you like

373
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,200
and so we got those for much the dawn
attack dogs

374
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,080
so is something like the active SCANA
and again

375
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,320
got the basic basic stuff there and scum
policy which old mansion

376
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,570
very shortly and we got these advanced
dialogues

377
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:51,279
any going say right exactly which input
vectors you know other properties your

378
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,679
risk that's going to ignore

379
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,169
exist and the ones generated by a
framework custom sectors

380
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:59,710
so hatch they define exactly which
strings you want to

381
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,980
abscam and you can disable a non custom
16 a lot just what to say

382
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,009
to attack this string on this on request

383
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:11,190
technology get to this overrides if it
fun the technology in the context

384
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,809
all well and good but then could
override it you want to scan for the

385
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:15,139
ticket of technology

386
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:19,210
and the policy and patrol come to

387
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,600
in a minute and don't go into

388
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,929
very quick look the so a lot so the
agents ponied up

389
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:30,460
again same kind of thing very quick to
give the options like can choose which

390
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,840
browser able to use now

391
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,710
and we got a balanced options which
light to go in and choose exactly how

392
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,129
many

393
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,570
don't what's called at this so the idea
is what right do

394
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,119
is make it and as easy as possible for
people new to

395
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,289
Satna overwhelm them but once you're
comfortable with each you can choose

396
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:46,549
either

397
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:51,159
advance options and too much more fun
things and

398
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:54,499
will damage their this scam policy we
used to have one scam

399
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:58,279
policy and and now we have this scam
Policy Manager

400
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:01,600
and religious the scan policy defines
the

401
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,279
active scandals and how those work I
we've got very fine-grained control

402
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:09,340
and so ever just look at it default
policy here

403
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,710
what you see is you can change
load/unload

404
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,480
aspects about so you can define the
threshold and this is a threshold at

405
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,740
which we report alert second choose to
report

406
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,139
fewer lutz et got more chance of false
negatives for less false positives

407
00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:26,139
you go the other way see more chance if
for spotted

408
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:30,179
less false negatives okay the medium
level is take a sensible

409
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:33,929
the attack strength here how many
attacks you want to do the more attacks

410
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:36,549
the more chance of finding things belong
to think it'll take

411
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:39,690
so casualties right low-level let's
something like

412
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,710
six attacks per parameter per page
medium is somewhat 12

413
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,690
hi around the 24 I go insane as well

414
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,429
and that's potentially hundreds attacked
per prompter per page

415
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:55,799
about you don't want to an insane attack
on a a large web app on everything

416
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,260
but we can do it you can choose right
actually

417
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,770
I'd don't want to do any of these in
this particular policy so

418
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,890
to or those of but if we look injection
of I just want to do

419
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,090
parameter and tampering at

420
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,320
a insane level so you can define these
policies

421
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,910
and these policies will let you know
work so you can have as many those and

422
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,910
William much noticed is with the attack
active scan

423
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,490
then what you could do is if you

424
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,760
had the basic options to choose which
policy wanted

425
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,020
and yet Advanced Options then you can
actually choose a policy

426
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:38,940
fine tune in for that particular attack
and the last thing

427
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,690
own this side I want to mention is a new
boat

428
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,919
so 38 up you smoked before I

429
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,600
we have different modes different places
app works we have to safe mode

430
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,120
safe but boring doesn't like to anything
nasty

431
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,890
at back actually very good said go
production website you would see what's

432
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,580
going on you want to accept things

433
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,200
are you just will not show you really in
a mess things up any safe mode

434
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,220
you know you won't feel turning bad BB
can still see what's going on

435
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,669
just very useful after that then we have
protected mode

436
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:12,110
this is probably the best one for most
people these much the time what used to

437
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,530
be anyway

438
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,140
now protected mode you can't do anything
bad until you to find some things in

439
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,790
Skype

440
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,140
so if they have a look if I don't
protected mode now

441
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,770
and it a try and ever right click the
top

442
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:29,950
though do you see that all they see is a
great day out whatever gets a budget

443
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,559
because that's in scope began at about
things not so that's protected notes

444
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,340
Google

445
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,410
would like to put in protective mode to
start with but then

446
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,720
no deal to anything that until it to
find something scope and

447
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,820
that clicked work so-called do that to
have standard mode which just means

448
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,940
yes you can do anything all the time
coming up this new mode

449
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,980
which the tax code and what tack mode us
it cut follows you

450
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,570
so rather than you know what you
normally do is expose the application

451
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,910
may be used the spider

452
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:01,430
but what and then to the active scan but
what the

453
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,920
attack mode us is it kinda follows you
so soon she finds mu

454
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,580
I contents of your website it's not
attacking them

455
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,410
says come on going active scan and I
miss comes follows you around the site

456
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,610
and so you can actually just choose to
attack particular things

457
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,960
and ignore whole areas in sight a and

458
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,960
that way you can YouTube focus on
particular areas and not go down to that

459
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,240
means I'll whatever bit

460
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:33,630
you don't want to today and the last
sale want to show

461
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:38,080
a a 240 is we have this new dawn this
new

462
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,070
dialogue for fussing so we just have

463
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:46,440
I left without a fuss at the pool and
that allowed you to fast one particular

464
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,520
string at one time

465
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,770
and allowed each choose up which have
the file via files of attack vectors

466
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,460
that would use

467
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,700
which is all well and good but it was a
little bit restrictive and it's the

468
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,720
we had some user surveys and this is
thing is most people have requested

469
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,490
and that we've we enhance so in that
house up these

470
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:10,050
first locations say she going to say
right this particular string that I want

471
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,090
to fuss not

472
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,950
and then you can choose the payloads so
you can say right

473
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,530
a file a lot to choose one particular
file that's kinda what of thing

474
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,420
and you can say with a comic saw lead
options around that

475
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,850
you can choose the file faster so these
are the and

476
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,240
for file piles of heart attacks that
we've got built in or that you've added

477
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,010
by dawns

478
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:34,420
and you can choose as many of these like
seeking

479
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,660
set whole range those we also have

480
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:43,020
rejects expression cigarette 6
expression this is experimental error

481
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,290
we do know for couple problems with us
so use this with care

482
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,500
up but we have strengths they can just
half

483
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,190
a set of strings a new line am separated
saying just

484
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,240
paste a lot of attacks in there if you
want and we also have scripts

485
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
and this is very important because up
what we're trying to do is make that ask

486
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,300
for it to those possible

487
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,070
so you can now write a script which
generates payloads and Astrakhan to

488
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,230
whatever you like

489
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,640
supported you anything languages that
support so JavaScript

490
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,440
up and we've got you things like Python
and

491
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,090
Ruby Justin J Ruby but because at

492
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,290
uses the Java scripting any of that
Jessop

493
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:27,230
223 like community should be able to use
and then what you can do

494
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:33,020
so that we can actually do

495
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,840
a you could defined as many these things
you want

496
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,200
and you have multiple piloting have
brought a letter strings panel to choose

497
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,960
what are these

498
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,400
sets of oil zinc

499
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,080
at those I'm watching don't not

500
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,270
I'm sick she going you could

501
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:56,490
define processes so the process is all

502
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,100
is these actually process the up either
the

503
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,580
attack payload up to the top pitching do
things like encoding and decoding is

504
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,940
taking on escaping

505
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,190
whole lotta things you can apply to the
pay Los

506
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,270
and also scripts so got script a

507
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:16,180
SPECT processes so you can write a
script that will to change the payload

508
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,770
in a way to build a custom app

509
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,320
which just has some weeding coding you
can write a script for that

510
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,140
and then you could make sure that or the
attacks are encoded

511
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,100
in the right way so we have a huge
amount of options there

512
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,610
and it's really powerful things only
limited by your imagination

513
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,320
it doesn't think in that you were isn't
supported me think should be

514
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,200
let us know me very happy to edited I've
got loads of options

515
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,590
so number threats on the delay if you
find out yet

516
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,610
detoxing your both the tossing your
application

517
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,480
lots of things and you have the how we
both have depth and breadth first

518
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,550
and we've also got messed processes so
not only can he use scripts to generate

519
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,330
the payloads

520
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,680
scripts to manipulate and encode and
decode the payloads

521
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,860
we could also and ap a message processes

522
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,920
and Mickelson built in ones am so things
like

523
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,060
protecting that they stuff tax been
reflected

524
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,850
update the contact link a

525
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,760
and scripts as well say can actually
write scripts which

526
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,220
manipulate the messages so this means on
you will

527
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,270
description getting vote both on the
request and response

528
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,840
you will have full access to everything
you can make any changes you like

529
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,380
so this is exceedingly powerful and we
think it is a

530
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,860
there's a lotta fun things I would love
to see some people come up with some fun

531
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,410
scripts

532
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,690
sir please play around with us and let
us know if this

533
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,860
anything missing in the chrome already
come up some call scripts and got the

534
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,840
community scripts

535
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:56,880
which you have so just said this pull
request

536
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,110
so that was

537
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:03,490
I quick overview all version 2.4.0 about
the home mentions the API changes so we

538
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,630
have this rest API

539
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,210
and has loads more you can do the API
the ideas what he felt easy AP life

540
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,090
pretty much everything this app can do

541
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:15,690
ASI can now kick off he always been up
to stop the spider not to scan at the

542
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,830
night can stop multiple ones are those
and have been running concurrently

543
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,889
there's loads more features you can
access for the ATI

544
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:25,399
and Sat sending message missing then let
us know we'll put it

545
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:28,730
and lots and lots of monarch has been
some bugfixes

546
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:33,120
I love the release notes fully for the
full list so

547
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,110
up there are is there are few other new
things so we got some new outcry dawns

548
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,659
one in particular excited about is
access control testing

549
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:43,820
and this is something we love of course
developers has been working on for

550
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,980
quick few years actually and it's all
about testing the automated testing

551
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,870
access control

552
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:52,269
and that is possible to some extent if
you're up

553
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:57,350
application understands things like on
you have to understand

554
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:01,130
authentication session handling I users

555
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:04,789
up but that understands all listings
Eutelsat how these things work

556
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:07,809
that you will actually you be able to do
you know this

557
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:11,860
that flashy understand how these things
work and you be able to do

558
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,010
that feel to crawl and defecation

559
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:19,210
and understand the differences between
uses and then to the tax based on the

560
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,490
different users between them

561
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,470
so we actually can also add hola access
control testing on this sequence

562
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,960
scanning

563
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,080
which means you can actually up

564
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,149
yet the half 80 got page if you got

565
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:35,769
on wizards which you have to go to page
one page to page three

566
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,539
we can actually make sure the plea
attacked a tree probably by going to

567
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:39,519
first few pages

568
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,320
I mention that a community scripts which
allowed to which

569
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,630
yeah anyone can contribute one ability
great resource there from things

570
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,159
so what's next and one thing out

571
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,710
I don't normally talk about things are
coming up because

572
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,799
yessir little bit brisk a particular
open source project and I and

573
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,850
contributors then was gonna happen up
don't make it to change this time

574
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:07,200
and there will be more the site so you
know we got a bugfix release coming out

575
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,700
soon

576
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,059
soon i said im not gonna give a date
we'll see in a there's nothing critical

577
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,879
we gotta fix we know a few things

578
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:18,649
up it'll be the next few weeks probably
then we're gonna have to improve taxes

579
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:21,269
active and passive scandals people
working on those

580
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:25,240
noon improve that on to be some fun
things coming on soon we all migration

581
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:25,899
to get up

582
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:29,210
this is painful we were on Google Code
it is shutting down

583
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,990
so get up we're gonna be getting that
but it takes a while

584
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,600
I'm will probably have to a doctor and
NC management tool as well

585
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,179
so that's all well and good but nothing
too surprising

586
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:43,639
up but it's a a on said on Twitter that
I dupont

587
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:46,720
to announce something so don't
disappoint I

588
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,190
and would also got is a new direction
for zap on the reasons this direction is

589
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,429
we want to make sure the exact

590
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,620
his works as well as possible in all
situations

591
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,629
and we've had some requests for things
wit Sampson really cope with that well

592
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:00,480
at the moment

593
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,269
and this new direction is something
we're calling internally

594
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:07,740
sauce sacked as a service so we want to
do is

595
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,730
take in senate have exact as a desktop
tool to put it on the service

596
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:15,169
and I want to stress that this is not a
replacement

597
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:19,269
you know we're not getting rid have the
desktop that is I'm not calling it

598
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:24,190
desktops at will carry on and will be a
pretty big focus for San a lot of people

599
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:28,529
most people count using and desktop that
hopefully who want a new wave runnings

600
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:30,230
at and that is running zap

601
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:34,510
as a service so this is really me we'll
see what implications

602
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:37,799
but one thing is a low to the site
functionality

603
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,629
will just look so you know all the
active sky passive scandals and care

604
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:42,279
whether running

605
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,269
a lot of his apt functionality will be
common across these two things

606
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:50,179
but think about the properties of what
I'm not calling desktops ap

607
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:53,450
we have a local HSQLDB

608
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,690
which is all well and good it's great
you don't install it on this

609
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:01,129
yes or very good for a desktop tool we
build up data structures

610
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:05,029
in the database and in memory and so you
know that all things on the side street

611
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:06,750
that's completely a memory

612
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,859
up and that's come things you want pho
up at the stop two-way is saying

613
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:14,369
you know the the streets strolling in
things a fast you like

614
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:16,830
is very necessary one process

615
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,190
machine one user super user essentially
the application

616
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:24,130
and you access if I swing you on all the
ATI and

617
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:28,090
would typically expect that to be
running for a matter of minutes hours

618
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:31,660
but days weeks is not too likely and

619
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:35,030
the licenses patch v2 mean to take zap
and you can

620
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,580
do whatever you want with it boat still
lingered so

621
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,030
that as a service what prop what's the
difference between

622
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:46,190
that and desktops up what's the thing is
week an enterprise

623
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,590
up database not something MySQL
something like that something big in

624
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,240
robust

625
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,420
make sure all the data structures are
built up

626
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,850
in the database none at this big 12
built up in memory that just doesn't

627
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,350
scale

628
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,360
we want multiple processes we want

629
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,040
to be that to be started we will
multiple users and multiple roles a

630
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,000
hierarchy

631
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,190
%uh roles within zaps taken a different
people have different permissions and

632
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:15,630
different talked applications the access
will be far a web UI as well as the API

633
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:20,510
so that's going to be a big change for
us and the application lifetime

634
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,860
this is the big one what we're aiming
for

635
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,430
is five nines compatibility now

636
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:31,460
but those have you who have heard the
term before five nines is a term given

637
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,300
to

638
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,480
up and uptime of 99.99 percent

639
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,880
that means in one year you're allowed
five minutes downtime

640
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,290
that's quite big that's quite a big
change

641
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:49,240
for desktop tool that we used to running
from matter about us

642
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,370
that's a huge change and so

643
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,130
you know this is the law to work here
but the particularly the

644
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,040
that lifetime thing is massive at so
2012

645
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,260
I underestimate the amount of work this
can be involved here

646
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,310
lot of things to do and I want to yet

647
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,110
people have said pointed out to me what
you up do you really know what you doing

648
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:13,220
and that's a very good question but my
answer is

649
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,710
up you know I still think myself as newt
replication security been doing it for

650
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:16,910
like

651
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,620
five years now I'm still learning a lot
learning of everything of course

652
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:24,060
up but what I used to do before this I
was a developer

653
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,900
and I designed on implemented and in
some cases on Iran

654
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,480
on systems like this so this is on East
actually me getting back to my comfort

655
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:32,779
zone

656
00:36:32,779 --> 00:36:36,000
so I've got you know I think I know
what's required

657
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,630
salata work I and the last thing is the
license

658
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,109
Apache b.tech this means

659
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:46,309
you can do what you like with it you can
take

660
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:50,170
sacked as a service you can put online
you can charge for it as fun

661
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:53,730
week because without so

662
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,890
one actually need to do out we need
twenty today takes independence let

663
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,450
HSQLDB is actually really good the
desktop there's no point in here we

664
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,589
don't say you've got install MySQL or
something

665
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:07,420
and so we want to go to switch between
on databases

666
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,180
config and but we also want to de
Facebook my school as well as other

667
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,839
things

668
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,329
up we want to low memory option and
again this is something you probably

669
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:16,650
won't want to the desktop

670
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,240
but from the server it feel to build
everything up within on

671
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,799
that text table century automotive press
option again

672
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:27,349
on desktop was that one process properly
but you know what these

673
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:31,569
on distributed processes across multiple
you have multiple servers

674
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:37,010
multiple on up a whole range of a in a
different data centers things like that

675
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:41,180
I am we want sport multiple users and
roles which is another biggie

676
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,760
and that whole load of things settling
in managing sessions and its

677
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,690
massive things in that and weed eater
and develop a wet you liked us

678
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,859
pretty significant and we're gonna need
a full security review

679
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:57,680
you know we try make sure the desktop
that is secure this app users

680
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,190
but we're well aware that it is tiny
talking compared with an online service

681
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,140
people really get a hot girl about and
install the possibilities for

682
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,420
you or your company he doubled if you
want to make sure this is as secure as

683
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:09,980
possible

684
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,880
so that's there are a lot of changes in
their doctor

685
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,890
and tenderness yeah I in a very quick

686
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,809
this will take a long time I'm not gonna
give you any estimate when we gonna

687
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:20,369
complete

688
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:23,599
depends how many people in get involved
how quickly that work

689
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,569
and if you want to get involved please
get in touch but we have

690
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:30,869
done some others already so version
2.4.0

691
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:34,920
has to take place independence let it
doesn't you know there's anyone

692
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,849
implementation which is a ritual
parabens

693
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:39,759
I'm HSQLDB incantation but

694
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:43,549
trunk we have another implementation we
have a second implementation

695
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:46,939
which is a generic SQL and that supports

696
00:38:46,939 --> 00:38:51,669
MySQL as well as HSQLDB and some point
will be changing over to that

697
00:38:51,669 --> 00:38:55,309
so we've done is we've taken all the SQL
statement extract to those into messes

698
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:56,439
and property files

699
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:59,479
so you can actually just change the
syntax

700
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:03,219
a of the SQL too much or database and
then useful but expects

701
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:08,519
and we also have support for the low
memory option

702
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:12,519
in the call so this means that's the
main

703
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:16,189
data structures we can build up in the
database in particular the side streets

704
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:17,029
a side street

705
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:21,809
did just build-up all the sites in every
a node which carry on building up but is

706
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:22,229
now

707
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:25,969
we can build that up in the in the
database rather the memory

708
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:28,969
thought that stops at he probably wanted
memory still

709
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:32,029
up but you know we now have this option

710
00:39:32,029 --> 00:39:36,119
say can actually runs up and low memory
option probably the API said it you can

711
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,089
run it with the you I just don't get a
side street now

712
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:42,229
and before we get too excited i'm
looking to go anymore we haven't done

713
00:39:42,229 --> 00:39:42,969
anything else

714
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:46,349
but one thing you know you don't
actually have to worry about you know

715
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:50,749
it's not a big bang where we say right
you can't use any think until

716
00:39:50,749 --> 00:39:54,789
we've actually finished the whole lot
things like on my skill support

717
00:39:54,789 --> 00:39:58,459
could actually release for the desktop
as a that I actually use it quite a bit

718
00:39:58,459 --> 00:39:59,159
myself

719
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:02,389
um something with this app some
yesterday we have to something out a

720
00:40:02,389 --> 00:40:02,969
thought that

721
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:06,369
we can actually have up multiple pic on

722
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:09,880
desktop saps all talking to the same my
skillz other

723
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,259
saved up multiple pen test is all
working on the same applications

724
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:16,259
you check the database and see what will
people doing so

725
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:19,349
here this features which will bleed
across enters desktops at

726
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:23,529
that this case is wat actually and use
these things with forceps the service is

727
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:24,079
complete

728
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,909
so the love me. up should be on till the
decisions at API that you have to

729
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:30,299
threaten 60 million also three other
tools

730
00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:33,269
you start using them low memory option
even though we have the multiple

731
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:33,979
processes

732
00:40:33,979 --> 00:40:37,839
ok start using MySQL across multiple
desktops even though we don't have a lot

733
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:38,549
to process

734
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:42,529
so there's a lot of things that will be
coming and already there you can stop

735
00:40:42,529 --> 00:40:43,069
make use

736
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:46,090
not stop making use of

737
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:50,000
and status FA Cup dot sight so

738
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:01,420
is our first question

739
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,480
up

740
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,330
yes yes at so we've had feedback from
users with

741
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:11,980
about and actually mazzella we want to
use it as well so we want to set up

742
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,230
as a as a service so that all about
developers

743
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,860
actuate people can use that so we want
on-line service from a seller

744
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:22,300
a and we'll be also in a bit recognize
that

745
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,970
other users want to do the same kind of
thing so something I said

746
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:29,230
you with you could set up within your
company week but on the internet and

747
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,510
stop charging for it us

748
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:37,900
fun enabled

749
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:50,619
yeah

750
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:52,189
we've not had one of those

751
00:41:52,189 --> 00:41:55,289
I think it did top 10 is up

752
00:41:55,289 --> 00:42:00,139
it's Connor I mean if you ever see
online a website SCANA saying

753
00:42:00,139 --> 00:42:03,579
we we detect the top 10 that lying

754
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:06,709
a the top 10 is its kinda its

755
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:09,729
more conceptual in there are certain
things like injection attacks

756
00:42:09,729 --> 00:42:13,159
but some the other one so the session
handling and is likely to that

757
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:16,199
up things like it where things are
interested in the database

758
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:19,539
well you can't you she tell that unless
you're cation particularly lucky

759
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:22,319
you know how to take to the streets in
the database so there's a lot of things

760
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,449
that you can't detect automatically

761
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:28,479
we could have a kind of top 10 but it
would be limited

762
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,169
I'm you know this %uh this certain ones
the top 10 or so difficult so

763
00:42:32,169 --> 00:42:35,809
idk some cases a wide range %uh
misconfiguration back cover such a

764
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:37,169
multitude of sins

765
00:42:37,169 --> 00:42:40,189
and some the session handling its all
time slot hope that

766
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:44,329
this so many things that could cover so
we could come up with a condom near the

767
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,599
top 10 policy

768
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,039
but the moment what happened but if
anyone a tip

769
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,429
companies each unit short vacations so
was pretty good government the cation is

770
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:54,709
scanning scanning rectally

771
00:42:54,709 --> 00:42:58,329
scan that application and then you know
if the certain things where

772
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:02,279
a particular technology or you know your
kitchen doesn't do certain things

773
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:05,609
you don't have to use those rules you
know there's no point in set

774
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:09,249
testing for Windows Phone abilities if
you don't use Windows

775
00:43:09,249 --> 00:43:12,969
a and then things that you know a
certain things you really want to test

776
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:13,669
for c-myc

777
00:43:13,669 --> 00:43:16,919
%um test for cross-site scripting a
high-level someone's we get some false

778
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:18,489
positives you can actually put the

779
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:21,509
and unit turn that down a bit so

780
00:43:21,509 --> 00:43:24,859
is ready for choosing to particular
applications optical thinks you're

781
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:25,539
looking for

782
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:28,959
so you might say right when a developer
checks things in

783
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:33,329
we doing a continous integration scan
these charges run the three rules

784
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:36,639
and then we'll do the full set
afterwards all the the a

785
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,129
attack mode you caption a separate
non-policy attack mode

786
00:43:40,129 --> 00:43:43,639
so Rob do everything you just want it
but you hit it with a few

787
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:47,709
months attacks just so you getting a the
injection tax maybe

788
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:51,259
that that might be a good one just
shooting into how you'd like

789
00:43:51,259 --> 00:43:55,689
basic come up with really great policies
you think other people be interested in

790
00:43:55,689 --> 00:43:58,739
your post continues group or something
on that tell us in with build up a list

791
00:43:58,739 --> 00:43:59,980
to these things be great

792
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:04,060
but I don't know how easy is to come
which one have to defaultValue sensible

793
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,380
and so you know will

794
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,359
someone come up with a policy it's
really play call to those are the uses

795
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:12,060
if so bright and will publicize it

796
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,750
yeah baby even come up with templates
with

797
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,920
really happy to include them without
becomes news ones let us know

798
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,119
and the scripts actually the scripts

799
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:25,570
so the community scripts are organized
in certain ways to install low safety

800
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,050
polo staff and get up

801
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:31,410
because she points out to them and all
those imported sickening import

802
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,990
collections a script second half if you
got a pen test company love you and

803
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:35,500
strips

804
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,619
you have those in another Rico a private
one maybe

805
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:41,850
and polos from there and all those
gathered to zap

806
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:49,290
sewing defining others will any other
questions said

807
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:54,340
here

808
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:59,700
word

809
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,140
yep but no I'm not going down a

810
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:08,150
its it's a lot of work up and it's gonna
be treated so

811
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:11,190
and yet when it comes down to it

812
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,609
I'm in a Missoula spots me to work on
that most my work is on tap

813
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:19,109
other parts on now found out a few other
companies are sponsoring their employees

814
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:20,540
to work on that base you know

815
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,710
I spent a lot of my time they spent a
very small amount of time most is that

816
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:28,300
people contributors up and do in their
own time

817
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:32,220
so sometimes I can spend at this time
out sometime something happen you know

818
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,619
family events or something that change
in circumstance and some in the comp to

819
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:36,230
be stole

820
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:39,900
it is really difficult to it do it but
you never ever had a

821
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,520
T half a dozen people working full time
and

822
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,560
then I think I'd be able to give you a
better idea

823
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,630
but I don't so on shit on Nov

824
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:53,920
sidestepped a question good question
very difficult for me to answer

825
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,470
but the i'd we're trying to do is the
features it's time

826
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:00,810
as a diff features which you can
actually make use of so

827
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:04,230
on the publicizing soon how you fashion
use MySQL

828
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:07,900
because I I use at with my skills
sometime someone in stocks

829
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,630
so and that's that then you have all the
sessions in one database

830
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:15,810
soccer and you know things like having
these multiple desktops alter or talking

831
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:16,580
to the same

832
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,440
and database and share information you
know we can implement that

833
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,230
before the full sons at the service and
that will be really useful

834
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:27,760
so which one do two things at once to
her time at half

835
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:36,680
useful things with things people can
interviews and anger the questions

836
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,780
or I will be around afterwards and I'll
be here for us the conference so please

837
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,840
don't be be using that come up let me
know

838
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,210
I've any suggestions I'll criticism you
know

839
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:49,100
things we could do better please let me
know thank you very much
