1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,660
thinkin its

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,510
to start

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,580
welcome to the Paul sass track on

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,500
get to see you all here and there to see
the whole thing is possible that we can

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,950
be this conference and have a conference
inside a conference

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,300
and as you can see I we're pretty
focused on a certain thing that it's

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,490
having some drinks in between army

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,280
if anyone's interested just arranged
with the hosts

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,290
of this mental here army my first
nudists going on to Jonas to express my

10
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,390
gratitude for this talk

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,309
it was a very early tonight and he was
challenged by the fact that a stupid

12
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:41,430
hype it wasn't working

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,000
we h was a challenge and thanks for
keeping the nurse and

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,360
standing here and now it's my turn I
shouldn't be here

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,970
but I am here the problem is that the
origin want to hear from much a feeling

16
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:52,600
from

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,630
San Francisco Russia here but he can
come there was a visa problems

18
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,340
and he just in the end did make it so
and there and just the backup

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,020
and 100 sorry okay I'm gonna present my
me talk about copy and paste

20
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,380
up with seams and seen the the talk
radio with us later in

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,330
because I think that using the Tigrinya
in Houston corporation

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,140
so copy and past I'm army

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,090
first some were gonna say he names now
you have small company reading pen tests

24
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,200
we don't make it you're saying is that
we just depend tests and security

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,400
and we hope you do this quite well on a
print some papers written some books

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,850
given some talks are maintain some
projects out there

27
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,030
issued for security cheat and I'm sure
if I am basically I like everything that

28
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,670
is within lesser than and greater than

29
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,390
which is the pretty huge scope arm I
don't reach

30
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,520
but mostly useless stuff and if you have
any questions that you want to ask me

31
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,670
after the talks you can just like write
me an email and then

32
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,180
I will most likely respond so

33
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,000
any with this stock is going to
introduce this

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,840
in my opinion like a fairly in all the
technical because I haven't seen

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,670
anything like this ever before

36
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,650
bought it is an attack make sure that in
fact requires using texan so

37
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,680
to unfold the attack to execute you have
to do something so he has to get the

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,780
victim to do something

39
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,110
army which is not so bad because I think
it's like possible user interaction so

40
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,690
it's not like burning

41
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,519
each that you have to jump through and
then this in this happens and you have

42
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:17,070
to stop your foot but something that
users would actually do

43
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,940
and do in fact so I know people who do
exactly that thing that is required to

44
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,160
carry out the attack

45
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,670
and the building of course every good
back as logo and here's ours bad was

46
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,840
created by where is he

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,740
where Spurs of various specialty thank
you very much

48
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,080
and the slow be perfectly expresses what
this whole thing is about because you

49
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,310
copy something and then insect come out
of a machine

50
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,300
well not exactly but dots so

51
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,020
to kind of show you what the whole thing
is a balding with the tech means

52
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,620
on I decided to kind of put the juicy
part number: beginning of the talk and

53
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,450
first

54
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,380
demonstrate the attack and then explain
how the whole thing happened

55
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,770
so let's do this not on let's take the
following story

56
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,300
we have like a user and his name's miss
the Derby and he wants to read email

57
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,090
Twitter Pena

58
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,260
and a huge sooo opening gmail which is a
commonly used with Miller may be in

59
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,880
order not

60
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,709
and you take the compost button and
investing openSUSE

61
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:13,770
and you 100 100 peanin home are you me
and then you would write something here

62
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,410
at home

63
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,780
are you human Johnston people or
something like this:

64
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,800
anyway anonymity can write something in
human resource home and I have this kind

65
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,580
of document

66
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,800
I want to copy something from this
document into the email so let me just

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,560
do this real quick the document is right
here

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,160
and me open net %uh that was kind of not
the best thing to do

69
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,299
Rams wants it up it

70
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,430
we open the document and me right

71
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,040
Anne Campina

72
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,400
and okay just indicated he would I want
to write what I wanted to kind of copy

73
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,060
paste into the mail to copy it

74
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,870
control a controlled see let me go back
to Gmail

75
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,510
to compose window mccade in here like
what's going on its

76
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,660
exchange tacky numbers that come from
the slick

77
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,910
JavaScript imagine me right now and it's
doing stuff to learn stuff that's

78
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,990
usually not a good sign if something if
this happens

79
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,450
and I select okay that's probably the
Spanish Spanish edge products in each

80
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,230
case bratunac hey folks music still
image this would never happen chrome

81
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,820
or any other numbers right now it's
gonna be possible for something like

82
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,950
this sweeping chrome to the same thing
here in the community

83
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,230
Indian books awesome works in Chrome
attacks

84
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,180
so this could be something to its gonna
be something more generic now the

85
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,890
question is

86
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,830
what is this thing how did it happen how
can we do this and how can we cannot get

87
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,470
to the point of understanding what it
does

88
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,790
and alchemy extent is an iclicker real
attackers

89
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,350
on it's actually quite interesting

90
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,560
because we're doing something here by

91
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,180
copying from one application that has
nothing to do with browser

92
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,560
some content and pasted into the brosser

93
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,920
internal up some have JavaScript is like
why even with that kind of like this

94
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,380
this is not a possible because

95
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,260
OpenOffice where we copied from doesn't
speak HTML

96
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,570
its be some kinda weird XML dialects and
dock in doc external thus far from it

97
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,500
but not HTML

98
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,750
and ensure somewhere under the court
also speaks HTML but not when you have

99
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,610
open document

100
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,070
exchange still wanna know what's going
on here

101
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,090
and we want to find out how we can
actually but this kind of thing and

102
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,760
what else we can do with this kind of
attack on

103
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,810
as you can see I can mention be copy
something from in OpenOffice document

104
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,590
and the pace this whole thing into an
editable area

105
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,830
in a browser like for example the email
compose window in Gmail

106
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,360
or Outlook re-enacts all our yahoo mail
whatever doesn't really matter which

107
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,290
kind of Tunis

108
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,190
it applies to all males author that have
a rich Exeter actually placed everything

109
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,840
that has a rich text editor I think a
lot of things appreciate that

110
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,860
and 10 where is this kinda strange and
smell coming from that is causing the

111
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,730
JavaScript execution because there must
be some kind of origin: what creates

112
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,200
this

113
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,210
on to do so

114
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,900
a we have to go back in time a little
bit and learn

115
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,850
about a certain thing in a certain thing
was back then

116
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,060
called and paste cut and paste is an
operation that had its origins actually

117
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,450
in the medieval ages

118
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,330
and people are for starting to write
books and then they put those books into

119
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,470
a very moist lol

120
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,670
and then the book started to mold and
then there is all the books breaking so

121
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,520
when you too can address key parts of
the book and put into a new book

122
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,770
so the use a scissor all razor blade

123
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,780
cut some parts from that old rotting
book and put in a new book

124
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,889
cut and paste that's when it started and
cutting a pacing is still being used by

125
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,970
editors today so for example if you have
like film table something like this the

126
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,379
new special scissors and cut

127
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:33,270
and the new paste which is quite
interesting and we do the same thing

128
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,280
and the age of computers this is about
Lisa one of the first actual use the

129
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,860
computers

130
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,539
for all personal use and deputy leader
was the first machine

131
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:46,190
that instrument at this very thing cut
and paste and also copy and paste

132
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,659
and called it are called the meeting
with the data that is being store for

133
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,259
this kind of

134
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:53,560
a temporary storage the clip art so you
got something

135
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,280
it goes into this temporary storage
which we call the clipboard many pace it

136
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,840
somewhere maybe it's still in the club
or it's not the poor anymore

137
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,020
& Sons you can use the cut something you
can pay something you can copy something

138
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,849
you can pay something that would
implicate things and that was the first

139
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:07,479
machine that actually gave the names
such

140
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:12,120
thats clipart restore the state now the
orgy of the porch

141
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,659
and pretty old actually I think the hill
first

142
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:19,050
mentioning off the cliff bars being
something complex being capable of

143
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,490
storing complex data

144
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,680
was coming from a pipe it for maybe an
and expect this in the published paper

145
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,349
everybody could use that and then some
years later Microsoft put a patent on it

146
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:32,440
and release the whole feature in Windows
3.1 so we missed three point one

147
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,029
on which of course that using isn't the
first operating system that we know that

148
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:40,110
uses a complex clipart the disc capable
of storing various

149
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,150
objects inside the clip art so usually

150
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,180
you could be some text the New Orleans
piece of text in the clip art

151
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,750
but with Windows 3.1 was the first time
that several buckets

152
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,300
were present in the clip art one text
back at one you Unicode text bucket

153
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,599
one a localized expected and so on so
they made it like an object

154
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,849
and complex store where you can just
like put various things in 10

155
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:05,500
so it stick with his departing the
people today is used in many many many

156
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,669
different scenarios

157
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:10,639
of course quite obviously copy and paste
cut and paste but I'll see if you drag

158
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,039
and drop in the data that has been used

159
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,099
for dropping after dragging

160
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:20,490
is also stored in the clip art there's
even APIs other specified but don't want

161
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,930
WC a budget by w3c sorry

162
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,009
it's a %uh publicly but you're between
browsers what kind of security

163
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,430
implications exist

164
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,640
what can go wrong we can

165
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,090
alright anhydrase should implement this
thing to people is pretty common I think

166
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,039
even mobile devices you can use the clip
art

167
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,030
and gas copy stuff and paste of some
relatives just a bit harder to do this

168
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,760
with your fingers

169
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,180
any hey the Clippers something that is
being used

170
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,840
a lot today so who uses the clip art on
a daily basis I mean I do

171
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,170
obviously like everybody does I think
except for you right arm

172
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,280
good man human so as you can see the
people is something that we use all the

173
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,710
time

174
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,190
and one other magic properties of the
clip artist but we have no fucking clue

175
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,850
what isn't

176
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,980
we have no idea it's a completely
transparent never check with cinder

177
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,270
I know that there are some people who
are certain the applied for the certain

178
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,170
one of paranoia

179
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,820
so you before I pay something after a
copy did I always put into the edit or

180
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,210
to Seaford really is what it is the US a
lot of time you can

181
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,190
to other things but that their parents
but maybe eating healthy because they

182
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,730
understand a particular technology

183
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,280
anyhow everybody uses the barge some
apparently

184
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,730
others not but the majority of people
including myself is no idea what's going

185
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,590
on the trip were just hope that
everything is fine in there and that

186
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,440
will result in

187
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,770
would be actually expect so what i was
gonna do

188
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,270
this hypothesis mice Justin Bieber admit
lights I think just me to come here

189
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,480
kinda made it to my slights

190
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,920
if you find occasion suggesting Peter
you're supposed to call

191
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,190
Bieber every very low T the first one to
call people Peter

192
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,070
good run you deserve a drink

193
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,120
yeah and that is how it works so if
you're thirsty

194
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,490
in if you spot a beber miss you the
first one to scream Bieber you will get

195
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:56,980
a drink

196
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,500
you can even choose which one is that
cool is that a good deal and it's 11

197
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,300
o'clock right so

198
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,950
anyways I was thinking that whole can we
get to the point

199
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,029
of losing this aspect of transparency of
not being able to kind of guess what is

200
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,120
happening in the clip art

201
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,700
and getting more lever on understanding
the clip art and understanding the

202
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,450
complexity

203
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,640
I was looking for a while trying to find
out if there's any to Lisa if you like

204
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,160
excess with law clipart

205
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,680
and I was searching for quite some time
and ultimately off on it with a simple

206
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,480
one to me

207
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,339
strong the Peter Britain I think it's
German dude and was written and

208
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:33,180
maybe he's here European you not and was
written in July to taken three

209
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,580
and it doesn't do you match except for
opening and then giving me insight into

210
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,399
what is going on in the clip art and
it's very very interesting because it

211
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,970
showed me that there is indeed

212
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,300
a bunch of complex buckets in my
clipboard when a copy something

213
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,570
even if a copy very simple information
Bowie

214
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,560
if you wanna do this thing and Unix I
didn't find anything that is working

215
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,740
well needs but

216
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,200
someone and told me it was day she told
me that the whole thing like the split

217
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,390
view tool from peter is also running
with wine

218
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,720
and gives us information so you can't
about this as well

219
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,820
which is quite nice an email imagine

220
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,310
you have a very simple fight like a
textile and you can just text value type

221
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,270
some stuff in there

222
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,370
the new copy that stuff and then you
have a look at the clip art

223
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,029
with Cliff you man you realize that
there's not just like one string of

224
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:20,470
texts and their know there is indeed for
buckets

225
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,959
we won back at the test see if
underscore unico text

226
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,990
in Europe that the drink in your mouth

227
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,260
but we have a co-founder school okay
I'll

228
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,440
miss even the score text and we receive
an escort we n Text so those four

229
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,290
buckets for that simple piece

230
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,320
of text that has no les article
formatting no nothing so we need for

231
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,490
budget so that some for the location or
something in there %um text the text you

232
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,650
need a test that's interesting

233
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,680
so if you could be something from
somewhere else maybe there's even more

234
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,690
buckets and even more interesting stuff

235
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,800
if a simple text file already gives us
more buckets so here I opened

236
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,010
your chest 365 and a

237
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,060
created some text every cautiously

238
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,310
an A for modded it and give it some
colors and some backgrounds into

239
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,470
Wonderland somewhat because I wanted to
create some

240
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,029
layoff for this whole thing to see if
this somehow reflects on the clip art

241
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:15,060
and then open TeamViewer again and
clicked on view and it showed me that

242
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,350
there's like a huge amount of packets
and their

243
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,790
re: using data object an object
descriptor we've reached its former

244
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,300
owners reject so much have the best luck
one of the best marketing which severed

245
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,820
wish action al which has been
interesting we have safe text again

246
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,570
unique 8x

247
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,470
has made a fine if I picked and bedsores
native on a linking source and saw a

248
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,690
bunch of objects in their

249
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,100
but all just caused by copying this
thing things like thirteen different

250
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,000
buckets for thirteen different things
and a

251
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,180
and you can see already you can guess
already with this issue because this

252
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,649
looks like

253
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:47,310
HTML and not get sexy in kind of gives
us the first explanation of what is

254
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,680
actually going on here why we have a
Nexus S and Gina

255
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,980
by copying something from OpenOffice up
on the

256
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,510
to whoever loves HTML as like to clean

257
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,800
and you know well specified in combat
language will probably hate this this is

258
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,380
the interpretation of h&L as Microsoft
sees it

259
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,459
because this is like HTML that is being
generated by office

260
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:11,070
so office upon copying something are
having to use a copy something will

261
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,240
create this buckets

262
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,390
in the clip art and one of his pocket as
HTML well of course

263
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,730
office generations it simple you can see
already that is coming from office

264
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,430
because it has like things like P class
msonormal

265
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,740
and it'll be fun for bidirectional fines
and stuff like this and mister

266
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,149
halogen so all this kind of weird
non-existing office only CSS stuff that

267
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:29,740
isn't here

268
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,160
and other units and other colors that
you would only expect from

269
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,089
in office offer to be generated
situation up just got hardly

270
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,920
but it doesn't it doesn't areas because
we also see met a bunch of things that

271
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,050
be manually created

272
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,959
for example the term Justin are
reflecting our corresponding

273
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,550
and that is good so we can maybe go
further

274
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,829
and have even more correspondence and
thereby men including the document mitzi

275
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:58,399
if this can be done what you've seen so
far out for a pic compilation is that

276
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,019
the clip art is indeed fairly complex

277
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:03,640
so we could be something that is fairly
complex as load information and

278
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,880
clipart is blown up to him containing
like 13 buckets of complex information

279
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,110
I'll bite sent localize information you
need good information age Mel

280
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,750
information rich text format and what

281
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:18,130
and that the whole process of copying
pasting is apparently done in a way that

282
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,060
the application

283
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,200
where you copy from creates those
packets then they are there

284
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,510
and then the implications are you paste
into says I in

285
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,020
me look at those buckets on this one
looks good I'll take this so there's a

286
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,800
kind of a

287
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,790
a negotiation process going on between
the copy application

288
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,940
and the pace implications for the basic
education just grab solid likes most

289
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,740
from the application the copy to
clipboard

290
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,110
which is quite nice so we have a certain
amount of control over that now the

291
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,950
question is how can we turn this whole
thing rogue

292
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,670
on you for accepting me see what happens
if you copy a file

293
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,660
BC theres again data object and Eunice
Iranian applicable to preferences what

294
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,260
depending on what you copy different
things would be created should go to

295
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,450
Photoshop for example open Photoshop and
copy some there's the

296
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,230
you can guess that there's like 20-30
buckets you go to look away from edit or

297
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,110
some all you to link up with the gym
there

298
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,400
he will again find completely different
packets if you copy that into the

299
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,500
browser process is like

300
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,070
I am checking those packets but I can't
find anything that is useful for me so I

301
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,420
don't know just give me a text or what

302
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,860
it always depends on what the
application puts in there and with the

303
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,210
other education grants from there now

304
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,420
it into the Securities its came over
here on

305
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,900
I think the keyboard attacks are
interesting but they have been around

306
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,080
for quite some time

307
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,080
still remember when there was X and
Linux forums

308
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,650
and people were asking the Coquina you
been to with two displays

309
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,310
and some dude was answering nasa you
just have to do this and this and that

310
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,600
just copy this code executed this review
will be fine

311
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,440
and there was of course benign code that
looks like it will be making sense but

312
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,110
there was also cold there was just from
it and fun says 0

313
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,350
so you won't see it but it was the clip
art were based on the console in the pot

314
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,310
I there was actually quite common but it
doesn't like this all the time big-tent

315
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,720
are

316
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,050
I did this on Flickr spot to come in
handy when I

317
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,320
so on the question is:

318
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,720
can we do this in a bit more months
maybe we've already seen that it's

319
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,040
possible that you wanna know Halton
whole community so can be modified

320
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,570
the document it's completely unrelated
to produce HTML get sexually dangerous

321
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:19,020
bet on it and start with the simple case

322
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,860
basis to gain OpenOffice on deeper
office or whatever something star office

323
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,230
ish

324
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,750
and you can cheer to our master Justin
Bieber

325
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,710
they are digesting follow me on twitter
and to be nice a layered this nicely me

326
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,560
give a nice colors and backgrounds and
what not know me copy this thing

327
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,920
and equity small application to kind of
be closer to the browser

328
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,270
not always rely on the tip you think as
an intermediate will

329
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,050
and the pacing is into the browser and
then again analyze the HML this

330
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,670
resulting

331
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,460
because the good thing is if you copy
from office annual pace into the browser

332
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,680
and the layout is being preserved and it
still down the questions like where is

333
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,350
it coming from

334
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,340
be learnt as a bit already there's it
smell is being produced an unattended

335
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,920
this is the HL that's being produced
believer office

336
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,910
it's not much better than the age male
the Microsoft Office produces so

337
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,230
it's just of is that smell like nobody
likes this is just disgusting

338
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,329
let me see something interesting in BC

339
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,890
that their stand in a statement ends

340
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,319
intend to stay element we have strengths
and strings are cool right next week

341
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,939
with the strains you know that this can
be parsing and strings are

342
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,310
been made two big break outing from
breaking up from and

343
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,600
everyone in that mean anything it is
actually possible so the strings on the

344
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,130
font names liberation songs

345
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,610
when twenty micro high and low it indeed
if you like in the

346
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,720
european-american areas will get the
default fund liberation some

347
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,540
issue in the Asian area look at when
twenty my cry and if you in the Indian

348
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,370
area and so on will get a hit Hindi

349
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,160
so the whole the piece of 30 sites based
on your computer lo que lhe

350
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,340
which language to actually show so just
in case all those feelings just for

351
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,240
those three phones

352
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,650
Aaron here which is quite nice anything
you have to do is we have to ask

353
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,360
ourselves doesn't correspond

354
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,760
with something that we can control in
that document

355
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,260
and how can you find this out much but
easy

356
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,490
we all know that OpenOffice documents
are centuries the pots

357
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,529
so you just go to the folder

358
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:11,519
and regret that file her name it is zip

359
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,539
depicted and it's a possibility that

360
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:17,850
and said this that we can do stuff we
can just have a look at the content and

361
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,830
find out what is in there

362
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,549
and one of those files is called styled
XML

363
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:26,299
you just saw the beam style element in
the H and generate additional

364
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:29,620
and then is a style and we have streams
but not the fun names

365
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,480
so it is quite of kind of kind of kind
of intuitive to have a good size XL

366
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,350
if those finance are also present in
this particular file

367
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,320
and in detail if you open this thing you
can see that there is indeed when can

368
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,190
you make a high and some other ones of
those strings to be so odiaun

369
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,500
and the first intuition you would of
course be that math is a streetscape try

370
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,600
to break those chains

371
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,129
or maybe even go further and try to
break the in tears Thailand

372
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:56,700
in injecting which email so my first
attempt

373
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,450
at this most to go into this file modify
it

374
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,750
use entities because otherwise it would
invalidate the XML

375
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,580
close to style a demand for food
including a string because with the

376
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:06,970
string

377
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,019
and then inject new HTML which is just a
strike from tech

378
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:13,740
s simple as possible then I safest thing

379
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,789
updated the archive safety archive

380
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:20,039
renamed it back to Otte opened the whole
thing and OpenOffice

381
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:23,370
copied the whole thing went to the polls
and paste the whole thing and boom

382
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,789
there was a strikethrough take in might
also and it's a strikethrough take that

383
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:28,879
I created

384
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:32,039
inside that funny so I'm in deep
breaking stuff

385
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,379
and can inject fun names and they can
break the silent and they can then

386
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:37,919
inject amateurish not that's cool it's
easy

387
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,789
research done and the only thing I have
to do right now is just like with an

388
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:45,230
iframe in or on em but although element
or object or a script ek

389
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,600
and then do best well that wasn't tree

390
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,879
because buzzers know about this budget
and its tributaries have a sanitizer

391
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:56,799
the sanitizer is installed in all
browsers each and every one works

392
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,049
differently but its base in all brothers
and sanitize the clip art

393
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:04,570
so whenever something is being copied
and pasted from one domain to another

394
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,299
domain

395
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:08,580
so across the main borders it first goes
through the sanitizer

396
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,070
and the Senate as i fix a sentence as a
yes group goes out I from goes out obj

397
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,279
ago though demagogued this all has to go
way event and let's go out

398
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,019
JavaScript your eyes go out input type
Oscar goes all comments go out

399
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:21,210
let's just make sure that the two
procession

400
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,820
hankins going to challenge their
sanitizer and the browser

401
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,360
and keeps me from doing bad stuff I
cannot tolerate this so I had a look at

402
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,179
the sanitizer

403
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:32,750
and I was thinking okay

404
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,190
what can we do can you break the
Senators is this possible to come to

405
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,299
find out what it does

406
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:41,990
hold works and is there any weaknesses
and

407
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,919
I mean you know sanitizers right leg of
course a sweetness and a

408
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,049
dissipate yes so what you can see here's

409
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:54,090
closing statement then be open guess
what an SVG element

410
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,279
because SPG is as mentioned a gift that
always keeps on giving and then take SPG

411
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,940
we have another stay element

412
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,980
and then be styled the SCG to be
positioned in fixed way

413
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,610
Houston used element we have to do this
because process with me cannot

414
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,779
have some a colander ex-army Collins
been character have no idea yet

415
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:14,020
and you have an understatement when we
say okay time zero

416
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,679
left the room very high very wide and

417
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,720
it should be transparent so this is
basically just taking care that the

418
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,710
entire thing to be

419
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,809
intend to produce overlaps everything in
the application and paste into

420
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:28,840
and OCONUS the magic we're still inside
the SPG

421
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,570
and we create a link our tank in this
link doctors need to be names based

422
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,020
seeing be put into the Extech namespace
and he is handed in a track

423
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,010
taking a patient or .2 nd a trip this
question mark something that

424
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,250
an excess sanitizer would not really see
is malicious

425
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,240
dispossessed in with a look at the
senate doesn't know it's calling

426
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,730
interest

427
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,840
freshman at school let me tell you
shoudl image

428
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,710
you make sure that the circle is also
you chose like four thousand units of

429
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,200
whatever

430
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,120
and over everything again just in case
in case the circle

431
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,409
and the next to disable be having any
made element an animated elements are so

432
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:03,870
great

433
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:08,500
and there's like this funny story when
they traded SPG veiy basically took

434
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,350
pg/ml from Adobe precision graphics
markup language

435
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,270
and VML for Microsoft and the celebrity
to unite us to standards

436
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,620
and take the best are those things and a
majority of refugees actually pg/ml

437
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,779
is like one tiny bit of SVG is actually
coming from the intelligence like the

438
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:26,490
city but that's an emissions and said
text and

439
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,649
ironically those two things from
Microsoft that made it into Suge

440
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:33,170
are not supported by Max

441
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,780
Internet Explorer and I think they know
why because the flexible metal

442
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,890
any help wine tastings is the Anynet+
element with the enemy element beacon

443
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:41,680
declaratively

444
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,470
influence the content of other
surrounding elements and we can for

445
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,330
example to hate

446
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:50,930
and I am know the child of this link so
the link is my pen and and and I'm

447
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,280
always in 2010 element unless told
otherwise

448
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,440
and I want to influence the attribute
explicate ref

449
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,450
name its pressure hanson et y'a du links
have to be any may double

450
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,560
like colors I can see that positions I
can see the dimensions are considered

451
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,340
battling sweeney

452
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,100
Republican abuse cases that that net
earnings are enable

453
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,840
you can animate them in the city and
nation should sketch its second 0

454
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,090
so right away and he any make strong
journalistic you and I

455
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,090
teen and present I know this is where
the magic happens because

456
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:24,790
animating something to embers and can be
done in XML because and present an XML

457
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,430
is illegal

458
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,400
so the browser starts with the
animations as the time taken this from

459
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,500
the JavaScript you're right

460
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,350
to the embers and then it really is ODM
I can't do this because and present as

461
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,750
in you

462
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,200
let me just come back to the old value
and a chance to from and thereby we

463
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,560
inject the JavaScript Uribe without the
process and it has a noticing it's

464
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,430
actually that simple

465
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:46,190
so to be able to connect use this in the
XML context and not mess up the parts

466
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,360
are in creating think that if a bum
formby of course of 2010 coated

467
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,830
and the final exploit looks like this we
have office fun face declaration style

468
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,940
fun faced l-name

469
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,500
and then here is our picture that's the
whole thing just to decode netted

470
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,450
now when the safety document

471
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,770
and renamed it to or DT and open it and
copy something from it in a case that

472
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,140
into Gmail than it looks like this

473
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,680
this section G major state anything to
keep you can send us

474
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,070
and a huge esta we have a dish
undetectable faults we have a message

475
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,480
even

476
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,620
still in its fifty a municipality and
maintenance doing its thing

477
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,300
interestingly this trick bypasses both
Firefox a sanitizer

478
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,700
and transit as a I have not yet
understood by an ant I think that the

479
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,020
perfect people are working on a fix much
about the comparable

480
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,780
on but you can still hear saying it
strange that the same bypasses affecting

481
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,860
two different process of course it
doesn't work in IE because like I said I

482
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,510
E does names up or animations and they
know why

483
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,140
any help say to get through this whole
thing

484
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,980
has it been yousef sense that you know
that you're OK

485
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,080
know was that and to go through so
things step by step committed

486
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,980
there's like they're using Anne the
first thing we could not let this

487
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,390
document immune from any use it can be

488
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,860
open the style sex on Ellen here then we
find the string my cry because it's like

489
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,070
one for subtle parts

490
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,450
we're in the a Western Europe atmosphere
so

491
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,440
we will never be shoulder micro I think
because we did only been shown that with

492
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,470
the chinese locale

493
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,740
so it is present but invisible to us
because we oversee just the European

494
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,170
stuff

495
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:20,570
any change this thing are behind gmail
orkut bypass we put it back into the

496
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,650
fight we save it

497
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,030
the close to five you open it in
openoffice.org and copy/paste let me

498
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,630
have an attack

499
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:30,260
on Firefox and Chrome which is quite
nice and I think that okay year Open

500
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,460
Office Firefox and Chrome it's not that
much surface that we can do better

501
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:38,400
and had a PDF and healing apfa candid
shots

502
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,070
on they are different and game so you
can remember the Exeter nothing else

503
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,860
and as you can see already you we have
Adobe's Reader in the latest version and

504
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,330
we have

505
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,690
I even the leads were and again gmail
and apparently some things as an art

506
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,200
so I had a look at the PDF in Exeter and

507
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,890
was kind of stuck with this thing with
that name so that when you look for the

508
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,320
section with a defined functions

509
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,810
and indeed there is a section said the
PDF whether to define the finance

510
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,400
and is right here but I learned two
things that are limitations

511
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,790
one limitation may attack and only have
32 characters

512
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:13,030
because a font name cannot have more
characters and PS and second limitation

513
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,500
is that they cannot use any parentheses

514
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,169
and I can use cannot use any and present
as I can

515
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:21,529
parentheses 9 present that's bad I kind
of have to work around that

516
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:24,609
and luckily my good friend from basic
script came for rescue

517
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:28,489
something and enabled me to execute
arbitrary code

518
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:32,129
without using parentheses and I E as we
all know still supports the BS

519
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:35,779
even spartan and you can you know this

520
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:39,269
me go ahead to be injected underpaid
language repeats PBS's

521
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:42,269
you jump into PBS mode images in DC on
killer

522
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:46,489
plus one because that also works you
don't need to Brazil vs anyone

523
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:52,720
which is nice and the effect yes %uh you
can also do spaces but I think not an

524
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,399
attribute its

525
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:56,919
only in actual script elements there
some kind of kind of changes depending

526
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:57,379
on which

527
00:26:57,379 --> 00:27:00,789
which context to execute a so way
companies into Gmail have a look at the

528
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:02,320
result in the editor we see this

529
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,659
fund element being created and did you
see the event and wrists

530
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,159
the language switching everything is
there and I'ma tell a year

531
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,009
PBS you know you have to go like he
attended a min or something like this:

532
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:17,409
on you don't have to because this thing
is future-proof

533
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:21,600
because an ECMAScript 6 we also don't
need any parenthesis

534
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,480
so we can use tactics to execute the
whole thing and the UAE version sorry

535
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,429
support this

536
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:29,789
so we just have to wait until the new
Iverson's are more

537
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:33,460
penetrated and market and then we'd only
be BS anymore and

538
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,769
back to use are also accepted as fun
names and

539
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:40,580
Adobe Reader and don't result in broken
file which is good just the best

540
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,919
academic 89 to death his friend the
section on family names we modify them

541
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,109
very very careful BX with the exit or

542
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:49,559
you learn some things what's possible
it's not possible then we kind of

543
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,580
changes accordingly

544
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,249
and now we kind of realized something
and we realize that the Adobe Reader

545
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:59,029
does not create an edge in a bucket to
Expo

546
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:02,269
we don't we don't have what we need we
don't have any action up but it does

547
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:03,629
create an RTF pocket

548
00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:08,929
which text format and then we also
learned that I eat upon not shining NHL

549
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:09,549
bucket

550
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:12,850
automatically fall backs to the RTF
pocket

551
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:17,570
and interprets the RTF on its own and
converted into HTML and then put it into

552
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,159
the dawn

553
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,940
and that's our bypass here because
there's another conversion process

554
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,970
happening from our TF two which Miller
from my channel to the doc we have

555
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:24,720
another to assess

556
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,500
which is nice

557
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,240
and I was trying the same thing for me
MS Office of course like my goal at some

558
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,050
point which is like to stretch it out to
all available office of errors

559
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:36,190
an ongoing process and disrupted as
always in a slightly different way but

560
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:36,660
it worked

561
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,010
so a great open a trade office file
opened an office again

562
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,270
and you can see again we have the alert
so apparent something's happening here

563
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,210
too many in arts

564
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,410
during mistake and open the same file
with the Exeter

565
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:52,880
much worse the doc file manager x5 I'm
just gonna weirdly UT of 16 from editing

566
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,860
snake bites everywhere and again we find
out that their spot names in there and

567
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,630
that there's likely

568
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,060
HS in there so you can again what if I
this thing in a way to produce

569
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,470
validation alan is capable of executing
JavaScript from

570
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,610
within the file that has been competent
person to the boss which is nice

571
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,660
same thing happened with a doc exx doc
xxx

572
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,250
this as the base so if you rename a doc
expelled was that to be a zip file

573
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,530
you can open it as a folding can see the
contents army

574
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,940
strangely the relevant information in
doc axe

575
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,930
is not as you might assume the styles
XML but actually the document XML

576
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,340
so then again we go here me at Dublin
Port Hueneme

577
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,130
Inc or it can be anything you quote
because and later following conversion

578
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,750
process though so be normalized the be
at the almost over sailor for

579
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,260
and you're done that's all we need and
the result of course

580
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,550
is this that's true you deserve a drink

581
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,680
did so we can see

582
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,090
on the I had to test a little bit here
kinda fuzzy little bit here and find the

583
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,130
right way in the right combination in
the end it was this one generating me on

584
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,040
was alert for

585
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,550
the other ones did not go so well but
main thing is

586
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,580
we got through me Nexus S so

587
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,700
step-by-step you create a doc me put a
hyperlink into the stock

588
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,420
be open this with the hex edit or or the
matching XML file

589
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,290
army be added to run a little bits me
make sure that we add one important

590
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:12,860
thing

591
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:17,030
which is a diff that s content I double
faults because if we have something

592
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,820
clickable

593
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,310
and headed to the area that clique will
never really happened so if you have a

594
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,140
lead inevitably area you click this link
there is no navigation

595
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,330
so we have to create an Island that is
non editable

596
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,450
inside is editable area because then we
can keep this thing again so it's like

597
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,230
an editable area which is the mail it or

598
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,500
and then in the Santa Clara

599
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,950
we have a non editable area that me flag
with containable fault and then

600
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,340
in there we can click links again is
like one of these excess tricks that you

601
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,650
can use when working against like life
artistes like always create islands that

602
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:43,890
are

603
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,890
edible Ventura text again so

604
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:51,570
me will urge frankly again transaction a
bucket we've seen this in the beginning

605
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,270
already

606
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,890
I am say understands that upon pasting
and I'm you know that his ass

607
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,330
and it's pretty much the same procedure
for a dog and duck

608
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:03,630
X they're pretty much identical except
for the content of the five-course and

609
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,680
then I was like my favorite attack on
because I was kind of running out of

610
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,210
office filed an office for Martin is
that what else is there a pdf doc

611
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,680
axle Otte your sister

612
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,490
oh yes there is the PDF killer that
never works that kind of a retired at

613
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,420
some point and

614
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,420
XPS the possibility to trend

615
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,040
a document into a file that a
self-contained unit contains all the

616
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,170
fonts and print all the fun and that's
all the information

617
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:31,140
and that has the file ending XPS you can
print to file in windows and then you

618
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,900
get an XPS

619
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,450
you cannot miss home with any other
windows and I had a look at SPS

620
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,380
and open but the hex editor app couldn't
understand anything and that was that

621
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,300
complete garbage

622
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,220
van der at the specification and it was
like many hundred pages that no I'm not

623
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,810
gonna do that

624
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,170
then I had a good pic EPD on this
election rather you make some kind of

625
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,980
compression me but it's like property
recompression and you can maybe cracked

626
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,610
the society

627
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,470
although I don't have time for this so
it'll be okay if this

628
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:59,660
is the file format that and that's then
I can create a font

629
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,820
and the fun can be evil and then I just
use this font on the attacker's computer

630
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,010
and then they create something that is
written in layout with this fund

631
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:11,250
then I say this as an XPS and then the
evil fund should be embedded right it

632
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,750
should be all there I don't need to
break the compression scheme just

633
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:18,290
take the fund unjustly put another in
the works and at any deaths

634
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,430
and if you look at the results you see
that it's like completely broke because

635
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:25,020
the also paced the minute information
from the public which version the beach

636
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,660
in advance for dance and song and then
finding high frame

637
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,690
music a good step ahead of what we had
before because that executes without

638
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,019
user interaction

639
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:37,269
now how did this well I used some open
source funds that have gone somewhere on

640
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:37,899
the internet

641
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:42,000
and then I use whatever tools which is
fun for churches like one very powerful

642
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,549
free and open source fund editor on

643
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:47,039
and had a look at the Fontana try to
locate all those properties inside this

644
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,320
font that could potentially reflecting
the HML that is being produced

645
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,720
by copying from the XPS it on a bunch of
things and

646
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,610
most of the interesting things I've
phone in the section on TTF names

647
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:02,090
and the TDF names contained several
properties and it hurts alt that weirdly

648
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,570
and I don't really know why

649
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,130
the English you asking for personal
family is the string

650
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:10,450
in the font that is being inside the XPS
and makes it through the copy/paste

651
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,200
process

652
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,590
on I identified them but as they say 111
222 333 and checked

653
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:19,309
which one actually rushed in the pace
that and business about

654
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:22,830
so into hitting right let's break out
anything that is here to create the

655
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,510
continental area on that

656
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:28,370
assessed faults and then we create the
iframe that is put into just got your

657
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:28,799
eye

658
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,250
alerting document to main and use this
as the name for the fund

659
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:36,580
a precisely as the preferred family name
for that fund if you can install this

660
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,019
fun and the attacker system

661
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:41,409
and have a look at that funds will not
see anything about this was a beeper

662
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:45,519
excellent as a drink for you and

663
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,990
if you have a look at this one install
this fund will never ever anywhere see

664
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,720
this preferred fun family name

665
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,659
some kind of this internal properties
but strangely it unfolds up a copy paste

666
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:55,789
it right on target

667
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:59,960
army to go against the best if you take
some free fall for summer

668
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,730
we open it using fun for Sri money for
to prefer family names he put it to

669
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,380
become some

670
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,929
my channel Victor we create a document
for export this document XPS me senator

671
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,829
on some copies on pace with Nexus S

672
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:15,050
that's pretty nice XT one of the box
that Microsoft fixed so with the left

673
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,679
edge Tuesday they fix this one

674
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,050
at least %um yes some hopes are to

675
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,030
not really but yet parts for the pics

676
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,730
I'm wearing contact on so vis-a-vis tax

677
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,760
and to give you like a clock quick
overview of what we've done so far we

678
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,250
have learned that we can copy

679
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,820
in a PDF and place into the passer with
Nexus S we can copy from a doc

680
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,909
or doc X and patient about Nexus S XPS
to the broader access

681
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:42,399
audit into the baltics assessed and
essentially most of the office of others

682
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:42,919
out there

683
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:46,389
so if anybody ever sent silicon office
financial executives the copy paste this

684
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,620
thing and put it here

685
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,429
be careful because that would be
something in there and those attacks can

686
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:53,419
technically slumber in those inside this
documents raged because likud ever

687
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:54,990
notice that something it is possible

688
00:34:54,990 --> 00:35:00,560
effects of the right now is office 2013
office 365 LibreOffice similar to its PF

689
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,090
read a contest the Foxit Reader

690
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:05,750
and it's affected as well and effected
by this is just an SAE Chrome Opera

691
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,560
Safari Firefox

692
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,180
anything that could anything Inc army
there was some slight differences

693
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,240
between behavior on blink on Windows

694
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,940
and blink on Linux and weaken or Zacks I
I didn't really understand why that is

695
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,320
because I just had a week for this
research and

696
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,550
it works on both operating systems but
slightly differently so

697
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,990
basically a full coverage of all of this
offer in all browsers just always misled

698
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,130
slightly different vectors

699
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,020
you can easily just put them on one doc
appts and

700
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,600
other stuff that you do as well which is
quite funny so I didn't count on a

701
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,370
limited to just liberals are only

702
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:40,680
so I always was thinking of was thinking
that what happens if you take something

703
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,580
from the browser and put it into another
application so for example if you copy

704
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,110
in

705
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:49,150
got a table from a website or a text
file and then throw 22 xel

706
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,900
it's quite funny because an excellent
you have like this kind of web service

707
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,510
function

708
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,570
and about service function is capable of
just like pulling a service and then

709
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,170
returning

710
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,230
on the size of the response so that he
can it's interesting

711
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,460
if you put this into an exe file and
then open the exe file the next would

712
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,750
say oh this is X security stuff you
shouldn't

713
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,030
do you really want to do this because we
can issue requests now if you however

714
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,640
paste it into xel

715
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,630
the security is gone it does not ask so
you pay something from a text file or

716
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,960
website into your ex rel

717
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,280
and the new perfectly functioning
internal parts cannot but just using a

718
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,610
combination a web service

719
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,290
and if and the service again and
eventually sent a request to the server

720
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:27,710
the $10,000 this IP with this part is
open have fun scanning

721
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,240
which is quite nice and I believe that
there's more things like that so the

722
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,330
further you look and more combinations
you tried the Morse interesting things

723
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,650
are confined because this whole thing is
just so complex

724
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,730
and i think is used playground and the
nastiest thing of course

725
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:44,260
comes from one of my favorite companies
and they created this amazing suffer

726
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,580
that we know it's the Flash Player

727
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,800
and music after NoHo yes

728
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,740
it's the veteran preference on so
fashions clipart API

729
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,920
and flash allows us

730
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,630
to shield stuffs into the clipboard

731
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,570
and fresh also allows us to define the
kind of bucket

732
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,450
that we want to feel the clip art with
and flesh says that you have a text back

733
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,360
at that you can fill

734
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,290
you have an RTF packets that you can
fill and you have an HTML bucket that

735
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:13,930
you can fill

736
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,490
and some custom box but they're useless
at school but sadly

737
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:22,150
require a click for that Michael Caine
flash you can do but Russia's re-arrange

738
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,550
imbalance at the browser in iraq we will
croak Rick says and really like a big

739
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,400
game hunting of the attack surface but

740
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,950
wait a second you can embed flash files
in PS

741
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,990
and if you open them Adobe Reader well

742
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,560
then they ought to execute so I try to
flash file that is actually doing this

743
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,400
kind of waiting for the clicked and
filling the clip art and then embedded

744
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,520
this into a PDF and make sure that the
whole thing is like covering the entire

745
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,240
PDF

746
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,710
and when you select something in the PDF
than the flesh for push for what for

747
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,440
just the click fits the clip art

748
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,660
on does this with a certain delay wait
until you're done with the actual copy

749
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,620
pasting then replace the content of the
actual paper with on clipart

750
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,820
so that means you can have a row PDF
that is using Flash to field a clipper

751
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,400
with other stuff months a copy

752
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,440
and you pay strong as PDF you get
something completely different in return

753
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,960
I think it's like a revolution academia
because you cannot pleasure raise

754
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,400
anymore because you have like

755
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,050
HDP based detection of plagiarism inside
your PSN such a papers

756
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:16,140
but yet no one kind of picked up on that
and I think a billion-dollar idea went

757
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,670
to the crapper anyhow this works and
this is quite fine

758
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,020
television is what can you do in terms
of Defense on because this sucks a

759
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,320
little bit and it's not really helpful
if we could have gone astray this idea

760
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,690
that

761
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,640
cop in place on earth and it's a very
dangerous and there's no defense

762
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,170
the I think the best defense is just to
use control shift v

763
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,840
and not to use control the because if
you use control V to paste

764
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,970
the pace with layout shoes control shift
me and you paste who just missed the

765
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:42,470
text

766
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,510
it's only the unique a text book for the
actual textbook that's been pasted

767
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:49,020
and not any of the other things at least
that should be the case

768
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,540
for all suffer and eighty tried to me

769
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,680
create a pleasure extension is running
in Chrome but my pony skills are so bad

770
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,700
that it works at home but never at
conferences are not condemn others

771
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,860
it's not gonna work my kind of hit and
miss two to go ahead and overwrite paste

772
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,980
events globally

773
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,950
on the whole page for every element and
then uses more trick

774
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,250
because some misusing like it slightly
tweaked version of the clipboard API and

775
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,420
that is also capable of

776
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,880
extracting the tech section lol
information that is in the clip art and

777
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,750
before actually placing it into
something on that page

778
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,180
I pasted to text area and this text
there is of course a fanatic the country

779
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,180
from the text area

780
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,900
a chase through access to data dump
purified and then bring it back to the

781
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,410
clipboard and then it takes to paste

782
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:33,410
but the Sun so adventurous and you can
already guess that doesn't work

783
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,510
are because I think it's a race
condition and I keep using this race

784
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,610
at least on conference a small never at
home because anyway

785
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,900
but on your system there's a good
approval for the country's on this just

786
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,270
in

787
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,810
kinda basic idea of how you could make
defense on maybe someone can pick it up

788
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,010
pick something better office

789
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,450
army I think there's any future would

790
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,740
that you can have a look at PKS as
mentioned I just had a look at a very

791
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:57,880
small slice ahead a look at what happens
when you copy something from an office

792
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,120
document into the brosser

793
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,380
and we got to the point of having excess
we also got to the point of having like

794
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,620
user names closure because this local
parts in there so I know what's your

795
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,370
username then

796
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:11,060
and other things and had like a very
very brief look at what's happening when

797
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,730
you copy

798
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,760
strong the browser into office after on

799
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,050
that obviously did numbers are disabled
son of some of the security controls and

800
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,760
allows you to do things that you
otherwise cannot do without a prompt

801
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,030
but I believe that there is much more
surface and much more things that you

802
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,170
can have a look at so

803
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,430
I guess it might be interesting and you
are welcome to have a look at these

804
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,910
things and find new box and you saw from
a different pressures

805
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,700
maybe find the possibility to Reina

806
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,230
macros without actually naming them or
something like this: a pressure if you

807
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,900
try hard to get canned can get to a
point of turning copy paste into left

808
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,619
foot execution

809
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:45,250
sanity army I think you've arrived at
the point of

810
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,570
where can save we have a conclusion just
in general be careful when you copy

811
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,250
paste

812
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,400
don't trust this kind of invisible thing
that is the clip art will be have no

813
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,579
idea what's going on there

814
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:56,880
respect the fact that is like a very
complex object storage that gives you

815
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,470
certain things and can do certain things

816
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,780
and keep looking at this because I think
there's a lot of parts and there may be

817
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,450
even bounties and it's at least
interesting

818
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,640
so let's see on nets it

819
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,180
thank you very much hope there's
questions or comments and

820
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,480
if you want to play with those files
that it was only showing on screen shows

821
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,790
you just click this link

822
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,310
that you cannot see because it's been I

823
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,369
but you will find the presentations
lecture just gonna miss letter Icahn

824
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:24,730
slaters leche X-ers armario and there's
the presentation and a link so you can

825
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,240
click this link and then you will get

826
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,530
redirected to get up in all the files
are there the PDF so there are the

827
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,690
doctors are they are the

828
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,730
flash file as they are everything is
that you can play with it and tested and

829
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:38,330
let me know what you think but I got
thanks very much the

830
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:42,850
its

831
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:46,730
any questions there's a question said

832
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:53,450
yes averaged yes there is ways of doing
that and some shit editors do this by

833
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,380
overriding to keep a copy paste behavior

834
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,660
army I of course had a look at which ex
and interest

835
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,710
do during the story in this research
face um I would say it's like 80 20

836
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,640
ratio Adia percent are available

837
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,850
20 percent protect against its not sure
if they know why and how but they kind

838
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,440
of have their own sanitization processes

839
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,050
so CK editor one of the anniversary
cover during the training

840
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:16,200
on the past two days already protects
against this on

841
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,710
because they seem to prefer stolen from
the security others do not and it

842
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,160
depends

843
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,860
if you use it in Gmail it works if using
Google Docs it doesn't work if you use

844
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,640
it in Outlook

845
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,080
it works if he was at an office 365 web
it doesn't work

846
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,700
sorry there is waste fraud against
protect against this this is essentially

847
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,020
be overriding the pace behavior of the
added to the area

848
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:38,350
and it's not so hard and with you keep
it up you connect on

849
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:43,630
I think they used on custom filters Mike
I think essentially you just make me to

850
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,750
make sure the jennifer white listed in
foster's white listening to it

851
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,410
and SVG should maybe not be perfect but
list that helps

852
00:42:50,410 --> 00:43:06,850
a more questions yes please

853
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:07,690
absolutely

854
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,590
up yet

855
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:15,230
did you respond and suppress the gym it
is indeed but that would use but I think

856
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,310
the problem is that architecturally it's
a bit hard because if you working with a

857
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:19,440
diff that is edible

858
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,770
and then reset the whole thing to become
like a knife and sandbox if a lot of

859
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,869
compatibility issues you could think
about working with for stock or what not

860
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:26,350
so

861
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,780
it's hard but it could be done it would
be one of the safe and

862
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,790
well proposal ways so agreed

863
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:37,780
in yes please nap

864
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,390
he can suck I just didn't

865
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,470
be free to do so i'm for a British roots

866
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:54,250
can be exciting results yes please nom
just

867
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:58,890
partially for that probably esta

868
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,190
but I leave this up to you the fishermen
here

869
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:17,280
a profession there's I'm a question

870
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,300
I should def but it didn't

871
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,640
on you see this as a recommendation and
in the cases where a try did work but it

872
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,300
didn't find out if there's like
deviations from this behavior that you

873
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,120
would get its

874
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,750
text only with control shift the you
know

875
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,560
instead of actually answer maybe there's
bypass but I don't know I can take until

876
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:42,540
might be another interest if you don't
look at XP's and

877
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,680
not those those a text field work

878
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,390
on not all of them to be honest but most
of them some work

879
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:53,250
course I mean I just highlighted the
problem for them like some weeks ago

880
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,620
sites would be told to expect fix but
this iframe thing has been fixed at

881
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,110
least

882
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:02,360
partly impressions

883
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,730
ban thank you very much and as a big
announcement

884
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:10,300
and the next person to be standing here
is not a speaker

885
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,790
by its gonna be on his announcement for
you so police

886
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,650
say hi to your in and a
