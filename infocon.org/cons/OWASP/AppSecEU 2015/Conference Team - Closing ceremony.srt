1
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,769
we a ghost reviews 0

2
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:16,810
it was the

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,359
sick you throughout the fifty becoming
too then

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:37,180
through heavy voter the realism

5
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,519
so in Los I interesting right

6
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:44,589
we did 2013 local

7
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:49,850
event you tonight was I'll 220 people we
hope to have

8
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,640
500 people we had 500 83

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,720
registrations yesterday's over you lou
that way

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,550
and I was very happy those excited

11
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,059
said it was a joint activity from the
bedroom

12
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:07,400
that Netherlands and Luxembourg scepter
so

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,660
what the new for the was seven triples
bed together

14
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,950
we have done it privately the last four
years four times

15
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,320
would've been like stay but it may be a
new concept have tipped as as I was

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,690
those

17
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:25,320
to work together make a big success what
should be for every project

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,650
I hope you enjoyed everything meet I do
for you

19
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:40,280
also Rachel was also my guess was not
witness who's apparently

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,480
over relax because very few people
ventured to misuse or

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,320
I hope so good education or maybe a puma
shoes at different type yes and I don't

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,660
know

23
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:54,470
where the border I think the mall was a
good event yesterday

24
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:01,580
you like Nemo and always

25
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,080
have friends a conference so think tune
it's just fun

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,369
to pick locks and see how easy it are to
open tho

27
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:19,100
think it would be as well bTW

28
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,650
in be picked up so

29
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,760
become them roughly and I think it's

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,239
hopefully afflicting the quote is
confident talk so read it over the

31
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:29,870
speakers

32
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,640
because recounted them and see how many
persons with

33
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,820
and it was all was really good
eighty-nine percent of green card think

34
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,340
that

35
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:47,650
things speakers

36
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,400
so

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,239
huge task next year getting any better

38
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,230
the best combines all was that the next
one to be so we hope next year

39
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,410
see you in Rome 2006 to you will be
proud

40
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:08,330
threat to challengers

41
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:22,330
I'm here come on

42
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,819
years of practice attitudes

43
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:34,139
just there will be a dick or a the I
still want to have kids

44
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,549
so to challenges that will take 0.0
secure if I had a cold with you

45
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,959
talons expect results as ongoing

46
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,620
and end of June check mark to the
drawing

47
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,719
because this can pictures and it would
be when they get a response from us when

48
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,849
what may be allowed to get that will be

49
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,689
a and next week hope to people to
benefit the bus so

50
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:01,579
the Reno the prize Beats Solo headphones
that will be announced

51
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:04,599

53
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,190
II

54
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,050
like always I'm I'm trying to organize
the CTF

55
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:26,220
with the up sick conferences this year I
added some more

56
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,390
shell and coding challenges and

57
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,910
was clear that for some people they were
really

58
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,850
especially for people that were already
know with rivers engineering those type

59
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,320
of things

60
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,630
other people struggled with it
fortunately the balance overall

61
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,300
I think was pretty good from the 72
challenges that were

62
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,490
available in the whole system top score
at

63
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,590
sick 26 so

64
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,480

66
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,120
the continued and now I have

67
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,560
the privilege to say that

68
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,640
