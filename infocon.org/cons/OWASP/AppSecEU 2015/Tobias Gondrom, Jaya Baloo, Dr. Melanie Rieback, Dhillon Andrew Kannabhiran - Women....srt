and even some with board members so that
I'm just

19
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,730
I have an interest and one of the things
that we do have is

20
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,140
the concept peoples who is struggling
with quality opportunities wells

21
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,480
quality about times on how do you
reconcile those two things we spoke to

22
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,530
religious thing will give everyone the
value applied belittles necessary

23
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,769
and because I will say this though he's
disparity in the total number

24
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,980
the present I conferences and
participating organizations such as a

25

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,519

39
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,890
text of people high-quality

40
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:14,310
difficult women good back

41
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,350
one of the things we're trying to do was
a

42
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,949
have a discussion about how we can
encourage more

43
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,780
women to actually apply cuz when you
don't have the women applying the first

44
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,020
place she really tricky

45
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,380
jus we would are not last people to
actually apply

46
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,729
and whether they do or not is up to them
that I would certainly like to see

47
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:40,130
a greater birth to diversity accomplices

48
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,280
that the I understand what you tryna say
say

49
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,800
um 10 things not done in such on the
Facebook group that

50
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,100
this help that are say and up to trying
to adopt some of those things that we

51
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,910
also knew

52
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,280
as an organization to help I'm still
looking for some guidance on

53
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,330
help best three approaches to be
actually to look for the invite certain

54
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,520
numbers of people to

55
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,010
talk what we do I think that view

56
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,550
other women also speaking

57
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,600
doing human like it

58
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,520
and tend to be dark here

59
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,660
on and wrong like many goes

60
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,220
himself track human

61
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,980
track specifically I yeah

62
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:39,670
klaas I think that essentially extremely
him

63
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,360
well forums there's not a four-year

64
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,780
Center a.m. let I mean

65
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,090
giant i right right now are you know
agreeing to be on this panel that you

66
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,230
have to realize for us this is certainly

67
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,050
year promise homes you know i mean but
the thing is that we can come here and

68
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,130
actually talk about technical topics
which I would have been extremely happy

69
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,900
to you headed

70
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,500
minded I don't mean this is any you know
a

71
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,410
disrespect of course goodness

72
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,290
but perhaps next year you will be happy
to provide technical content

73
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,590
me in the day that anywhere in just a
lot more respect 7

74
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,900
just things like I think to be fair
you're right you gotta be submitting

75
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,710
talking are to get invited to them but

76
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,830
on the keynote you guys have a couple of
milking out on all the things if you

77
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,669
really wanted to

78
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:27,169
have that gender diversity which I don't
exactly the qualification that

79
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:32,280
either million are proud to advertise
yeah at just a very personal note

80
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,780
and I want to keep in which it said
telco

81
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,600
and they wanted to recognize me not KPN

82
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,950
but some a lawyers Committee for being
the

83
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,370
multi-ethnic anti-male I

84
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,760
and women in the year iPad

85
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,080
why bother to get me and I will

86
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,710
had it for two things I have my thing to
do and I have no control over this and i

87
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,159
cant

88
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:00,500
change them even if I Y two and eastern
effort at my own

89
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,590
that men should be either multi-ethnic
where a woman it's okay if you actually

90
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,620
yeah he actually took a look at the Rec
Center

91
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,680
trying to do or the things I'm trying to
change

92
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,770
on the Internet or in security or my
call to have

93
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,110
you know secure POS quantum
cryptographic ciphers take a look at

94
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,840
that stuff

95
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,150
and then let me talk about that i am.
senior Adam bad well rather than really

96
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,729
promoting my woman this which

97
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,250
as my yeah I know pic see

98
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,430
tonight here's what I'm hearing and is
at hand and host

99
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,210
teams that help me help fix what's in my
brain now I'm hearing

100
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,539
look feel a special treatment as well
not just happy to have this trauma

101
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:41,509
center should matter

102
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:45,620
tell the others has like will we should
get some additional invitations at the

103
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,669
keynote level

104
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:49,840
specific for women to have more
diversity so

105
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,029
ill I abuse use the question what play

106
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:57,440
do we do we as IT professional chichi
women like

107
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,069
any ordinary people with respect and the
fact that women should not matter at all

108
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:04,889
of at what point should we be giving
special opportunities for women

109
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,180
because of the very male centric a I

110
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,099
industry have an 80 right now wish to
balance their to differ questioner

111
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:16,259
look I didn't say it could make you know
cuz I'm female I said give making out

112
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,089
because I'm gonna provide technical
content

113
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:21,229
I've done it before it I've been invited
before

114
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:25,310
mostly for reasons like the research
that I was doing

115
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,500
I would like to hope and think that the
my femaleness had very little to do with

116
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:29,789
that

117
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,539
so him

118
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,229
you ruler you alright do you know

119
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:39,389
over okay because they were measured
Chur

120
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:42,969
let you know okay let's talk about
people that were known I did the opening

121
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,790
keynote at the NTSC one conference this
year and I had the best panel because at

122
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,740
the most amazing people

123
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,509
but at the edges ACS 100 here I would
consider myself in that bucket

124
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:57,680
known I was invited and

125
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,870
and you know I did all thinking after
the that what you call it there the

126
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,009
statuette at its new dude and it all

127
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:07,139
in international conferences as well as
is being alleged so I don't

128
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,319
it's just I think that there's a generic
preference like there's a sort of

129
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:11,690
knee-jerk reaction

130
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,209
to not necessarily try to the

131
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:19,199
if there is one in there that it's less
the exception than the rule

132
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:22,399
and it's not based on that quality above
their

133
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,269
content but that tendency that you tend
to take that guy

134
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:29,630
sometimes more seriously an EU but in
general

135
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,839
a men may I mayor speak to this just a
moment

136
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,649
and so I think there's there's two
things one is like

137
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:40,199
why did be what might it be the
conference team pic

138
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:45,110
selected he knows yes they did I was not
part of that selection team

139
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,180
but to some degree I think jim is right
this is like

140
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,430
people who were already speakers s at an
almost

141
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,199
conference before so they they went
through this before they have done this

142
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,639
somewhere else before and then

143
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,209
they got at some point invited as a
keynote speaker for people who are

144
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:02,110
really known within this community

145
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,579
so yes you were keynote speaker and yes
I i have no doubt that you can't put

146
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:11,639
with get great deals the question is did
this election team

147
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,310
know you from and maybe they didn't know
you

148
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,420
and i mean that that may be very well
therefore her but

149
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,939
we all human beings we only know so many
people so I will definitely

150
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:26,130
a.m. I would have loved to have you as
the keynote speaker

151
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,779
okay and I I would definitely recommend
that but it's not my selection pretty as

152
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:31,600
the light source

153
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,300
and and maybe if you want to be a future
keynote speaker

154
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,139
you can actually to submit the technical

155
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:40,769
talk yes and that would be very very
welcome NB

156
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:43,799
actually want to have more women submit

157
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:49,309
technical talks so we can select more so
and then that that's the problem 100 and

158
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:50,089
women to submit

159
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,439
to see if he is right and how to get
more can't let that would be wonderful

160
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:56,879
on that yeah now I think that's a very
fair thing and I think you're right

161
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,970
we that women really want to do this we
actually should bit to be fair

162
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,359
why did I have given probably like four
talks in elastin 'em

163
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:07,790
month and a half anyway in other places
great will be that it

164
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,290
ok I omitted you know and I just
completely miss my dad has admit here

165
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:11,999
but you know

166
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:19,730
that happens I his

167
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,009
alright so should the next flight and
the last thing a you got

168
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:26,350
aa today to hoops post kinda

169
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,669
it I will send you their CFP

170
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:36,389
okay yeah killed

171
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:44,249
ok

172
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:45,069
this go

173
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:49,249
I and and a often there

174
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:52,869
%uh is where the the barriers can be

175
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:56,149
does it you know you're talking about a
new

176
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,589
paradigms are in New innovation thats

177
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:05,589
really not known well what's important
and being able to be heard for doing

178
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:07,329
that is terribly difficult

179
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:12,629
so maybe in if you don't come out health
up but some kind of an industry that has

180
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:13,869
standing already

181
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:17,919
mean you're really trying to do
something systemic and fundamental

182
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,029
a very hard to be heard and

183
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:25,299
this is true I in the US and around the
world as far as I know

184
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:28,409
so it's so reassuring if you think
differently

185
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:32,579
up and and sometimes women do it's very
hard

186
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:36,839
to get into the stream and I'm flight to
the US

187
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,779
upset to talk and I just heard yesterday
I think that it's been decided

188
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:47,319
whose house going to you know the one in
San Francisco

189
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:51,109
you're out there it I never heard back
so

190
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:55,939
I think yes I do and how it's gonna work
but anyway

191
00:12:55,939 --> 00:13:01,209
and I think you know looking for those
entrepreneurs developers that are doing

192
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:05,679
unusual things not because they come
from be company necessarily all that

193
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,239
nothing wrong with that but

194
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:10,489
some just just playing so

195
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,859
maybe are I mean the selection of

196
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:18,249
of keynotes at least at all %uh is
purely on content and we tried to

197
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:22,119
take of company affiliation a

198
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:26,139
all this stuff we we we actually tried
to ignore by consciously

199
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,229
its kinda we had to the sages that's a
funny you ignore comes as the butt

200
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:34,929
so we we try to focus only on content
and the review was purely on the content

201
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:35,209
of

202
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:38,729
of the talks we take another question
then should we actually a question

203
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:39,459
should we

204
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:42,849
at the component that we should prefer
women yet

205
00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:46,889
that that would be a question I would
like to ask you i mean what you say

206
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:49,209
at this point women are underrepresented
in

207
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:53,519
should make it and at this link here if
you're female

208
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,220
you get like one extra point in the
selection criteria would you want

209
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:03,119
I mean 10 km miss we need to have a
balanced bus

210
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:08,269
ima what you want I mean would you want
to looking either you want to

211
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:12,079
to balance technical quality with for
some amount of a diverse city

212
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,179
yes and I mean anyway that's probably a
natural bias oftentimes just let people

213
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:18,480
at once on nurses social circles

214
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,290
yeah he'll be ready now yeah exactly
your GPS also it probably isn't even

215
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,139
necessarily

216
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:27,350
a preference but is just %uh trying to
ensure that you have that right

217
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,660
so to the extent that crazy which I
think anyway conference the

218
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,579
well steps that anyway attempt to do
also with regards to different subjects

219
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,639
are being represented in different areas
different streams a research so

220
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,949
one and also you know assuring the
diversity

221
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:49,379
else me he I mean this is stupid

222
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:55,460
sniffing unique us which is very

223
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,399
its instead

224
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,050
months

225
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:08,370
and it doesn't ashes

226
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,150
there's a question and back there at New
Year

227
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,880
together and and believe it yet don't
know the lady we hey

228
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,720
she had been trying to have a few
minutes and hehehe so

229
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,020
night I retired yeah it so I'm trying to

230
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,990
my dc2 questions and trying to mind the
mat on the I can

231
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,480
I help run a couple conferences and in
one of them

232
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,050
we have completely double-blind we have
no idea who submitted where they're from

233
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,140
and we tend to have very high ratio

234
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,780
female speakers armored we tend to be
applauded for having more diversity

235
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,240
it's not deliberate 'em which actually
provoke retaliation for some groups

236
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,630
saying we had a quota system

237
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,660
'em then

238
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,090
on the other hand I he was running on
the track where the microstructure

239
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,200
required fifty percent speakers to be
within and we didn't have very many

240
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,040
submissions

241
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,530
and we were criticize for it for that
from and i genuinely especially

242
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,470
somebody wants to see more total
diversity not just Jennifer C

243
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,990
um I struggle with well-intended people
find the right ways to do it without

244
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,680
provoking

245
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,790
retaliation response that's one half a
bit you might be that we need a

246
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,820
intermediary

247
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,150
plan verses the when we get it right a
look like this plan

248
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,580
I think one of the reasons that
conference gets more submissions as good

249
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,980
as perceived to be a seizure

250
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,100
more by inviting place so it

251
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,730
it perpetuates that um is we also

252
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,460
you know made a mistake this year
something she's being very honest we

253
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,050
tried to get rid a booth babes

254
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,750
arce successfully got rhythm with them
to reach mister say to change that

255
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,620
by whoever made the pain phrases such a
way that

256
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,600
it was exclusive to you it was just men
and women it wasn't about multinational

257
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,699
wasn't multi identity

258
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:59,829
so is essentially a dress code for
professional your

259
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:03,680
here so there's a yellow smiley

260
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,860
I'll dear so I'm what I'm trying to do
is urs e

261
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,860
there Z large group of people who
genuinely want to fix on these problems

262
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,539
who struggle to figure how to do so and
it might be that the appropriate

263
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:17,600
intermediary steps may be different in
the future steps that's what happened my

264
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,299
question

265
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,650
take it if you like it the other half is
them

266
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,949
are there initiatives

267
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:28,329
or voices that are making it better

268
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:32,450
are there in this is forces they're
making it worse so the kind of related

269
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,789
but it was having is a chilling effect
so every time I seen someone try to do

270
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:37,380
something

271
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,630
elegy even if its malformed there
they're almost punished for trying so I

272
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,429
think this helps

273
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:46,470
a had a chilling effect on making
progress like and very close accuser

274
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,500
she's wanna leaders

275
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,559
calorie she gets very frustrating was on
patrol in the Top 10 Women list because

276
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,280
she's just

277
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,340
an amazing researcher in the arson
period

278
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,120
yeah she's must be a top something
listener top limitless so

279
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,510
which attributes of things you have seen
help

280
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,740
the situation which attributes hurt the
situation and others last of my two

281
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,299
questions

282
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:13,730
those are two very big questions there

283
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,880
I could just get a party that as is more
of a comment rather than an answer your

284
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,980
question but I am

285
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,480
I do think that we tend to kinda goal

286
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,809
far off the mark when we're trying to
talk about like these kinds of issues

287
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:29,510
and that dress code thing really is is
quite compelling

288
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,700
and because there's this I won't tell
you an anecdote

289
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,760
who is a hack in the box and one of my
over it

290
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,049
two guys that work for me in nineteen
we're doing a presentation

291
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:39,970
on

292
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,540
how to hack and mobile networks using
specific

293
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,610
Durex components and at the II review
their slide and the underside you know

294
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,420
they had this one

295
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,140
picture of Q&A in which I tried to make
their tires light set a bit better

296
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,130
and am just now getting to slide this is
a bloody boring slide this is the

297
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,230
a demanding can you give me like
something cute or

298
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,350
make it nicer and so I gave them a
pitcher women

299
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,790
with her glasses being like this saying
questions and it it

300
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,290
might be intermediate some is like
overly sexy or whatever

301
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,970
but I gave them the bloody pitcher and
some there was one in the audience that

302
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,360
said

303
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,270
but then it's very sexist then you do
this in your queue it does not necessary

304
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:25,520
measuring a bikini amateur but I

305
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,510
gave them the pitcher I did that and it
was like I really don't appreciate this

306
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,010
treatment of women and little

307
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,490
and I don't know exactly what she said
she was very from be and about

308
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,550
the way that she said it not Ashland and

309
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,570
so just make the point I did that you
know

310
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,800
I think it's also cut kinda disrespect a
kitten that women don't have that common

311
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,530
sense where

312
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,850
decision-making power to decide what
they wear when

313
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,120
in which context they can it put in you
know

314
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,580
whatever so that dress make I'm not now
I'm gonna love it place around like got

315
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,270
might my point is that kinda dress code
thing evokes the same response in me

316
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,360
as that woman who dares to judge one
slide

317
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,010
on a perfectly valid Dec because there
was a girl in it you know that

318
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,420
I find that mean really have a knee-jerk
response to the

319
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,890
radically from be sheesh

340
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,440
just talking hit here

20 actual Angeles his future

342
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:48,070
no d in for I was like it's not that

343
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:52,120
just really to lose journals or

344
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,540
top but he's

345
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,900
house held us to me then yeah

346
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,850
to be fair though at fine you say
they're ready eight-year-old is what I

347
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,210
find is that the

348
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,440
that you started with a sexual slash
sensual stuff that

349
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,030
the dirty job part if in that requires
me one thing sense of humor

350
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,690
and it doesn't require gender change in
order to appreciate a good day

351
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:18,460
joke and that's just it you know and of
course that some things are always be

352
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,240
inappropriate regardless of whether it's
between men

353
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,610
between men and those lines they're very
easily crossed when I find more

354
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,560
offensively they're not as when I was
interviewed and someone said

355
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,850
how you do this job with three kids I
think how do you do this job three kids

356
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,240
I find those things sexist

357
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,140
and offensive rather than some kid at a
university is making a

358
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,930
actually it very nice pallet dirty joke
that even I can Moffat

359
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,300
and I that sense of humor I don't think
we should dare to lose it

360
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,610
with our yeah I can also at work

361
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,720
recall one time I had an interview and

362
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,640
and the interviewer had asked me
something about the no being picked up

363
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,220
by a with their pen tester says so I
have this thing sometimes happens

364
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,100
your point mister your

365
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,270
role him ruin your career

366
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,679
there's lot my experience long

367
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:13,850
disagree with that these will choose be

368
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,299
the fuel not Harley grouping a wrister

369
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:20,340
thrall deal with fresh out of college
also

370
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,409
NUJ top really mint

371
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:27,460
these a bill singer

372
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,530
social room with also

373
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:34,220
young women also content becomes mister

374
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,940
to huge region and challenges

375
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,429
is it it's just hard it he

376
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:49,070
sorry or up

377
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,500
very races

378
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,220
old here

379
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,630
yep

380
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,019
old

381
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:05,520
up

382
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:13,289
be who yep

383
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:17,419
to be fair I think there's a difference
between

384
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:20,500
a funny dirty joke and something that
female unfriendly

385
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,669
there is a that and that line is equally
offensive I agree with you completely

386
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:27,770
that he will you crave that equally
great just men

387
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:32,809
find it also not done you know I had 7
but

388
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:36,549
yep

389
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:40,630
him up

390
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,120
yeah

391
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,990
I good review

392
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,090
yeah yeah

393
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,299
yeah

394
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:59,220
good its that be

395
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,350
I am yep so what they're missin

396
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,700
so for so far I'll being the only see
mine and he lost twenty security

397
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,380
engineers

398
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,510
on there are two things I would like to
say one arm

399
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,370
I agree with you on San find out I don't
think that's a difference of

400
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,789
I don't have a sense of deep seemed
sense if you missed out because

401
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:21,799
lotta times I get along with them the
joke about things

402
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:26,159
and it's a good working relationship
both socially as balanced

403
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,809
from a work standpoint but their are
times when

404
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:32,929
it crosses the line and I actually have
management

405
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:36,140
cause that out so my manager would you
know

406
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,510
call out a person if the cross the line

407
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:44,000
are set something that is just not cool
like so I've definitely

408
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,260
had issues at work read that has
happened there I'm like

409
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,299
I can't believe you would say that not
because you're in a sense of humor but

410
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,370
because what you said is deeply
offensive

411
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,340
to just all-female right and that that
that my point that there are two

412
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,090
categories and those things

413
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,100
even so has nothing to do with the a
woman in the group 29

414
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,190
n it might know him that sent by what
needs to be done is at that point

415
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,980
to me what helps is if coworker of mine
a miracle worker final my manager cause

416
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,700
that out

417
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,070
so I don't feel like yes now only
persons offended by this

418
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,270
yep to: question what he said what can
you do

419
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,860
that's probably what you again partner I
don't participate again

420
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:37,970
yeah

421
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,049
good

422
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:45,380
me

423
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:52,390
here

424
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,680
who enjoys he changes

425
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,690
maybe

426
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,720
dynamic choice for you

427
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,690
except jokes party speak say something

428
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:13,290
the what I think that depends on the
woman

429
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,130
yeah I think so it has also I mean you
know some women are actually quite

430
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,640
comfortable being one of the guys

431
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,580
yeah and others are not and I just have
to go with what your personal use

432
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,020
yep player he

433
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,040
me also based on the persian yeah

434
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:36,890
that now

435
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,540
but hold

436
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,310
him

437
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:48,130
Abbottabad from all this

438
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:52,140
issue I had was a scene that to are
there certain cases there berman

439
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,860
other female employees are paid less
other than as young millionaire

440
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,080
but you can place because they are
considered the piano she is a woman

441
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,720
yeah so you know I'll have that might be
honey as well so

442
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,860
it doesn't make sense because you I
looking add that the point of our dying

443
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,410
and you're also doing your job nobody's
had been you there wanted anything you

444
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,870
look up sir anything can use that sucks

445
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,490
good iPod is retracting yeah I kept
thinking you were

446
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:25,110
damage your comments 0 and I agree to
you and but I think that also sometimes

447
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,700
it and not saying that in general but I
think that women really need

448
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,970
to stand up for themselves when it comes
to equal work equal pay

449
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,040
and also understand their own value and

450
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,200
and even I find it very difficult to be
like that said

451
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,000
yet did we have to talk about my salary
and I can joke about that I can

452
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,740
necessarily

453
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,800
when those moments con do that well I
think and I noticed that among

454
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,710
my other women colleagues we have a
harder time demanding what we deserve

455
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,500
and that when its not being presented

456
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,590
automatically actually game that and
filling that gap that's it

457
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,770
and also understanding that is equally
what you deserve and

458
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,630
we tested we tend to be much more
conservative met in general as a general

459
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,080
rule

460
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,090
this doesn't apply to everybody that
yeah I think we also need to be that

461
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:09,530
more

462
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,470
mandating the company's I really don't
up program like that

463
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,270
that the million prize are you know
though if you come to their Josh

464
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:21,440
discussion David start with Diana was a
little

465
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,890
they should be very laps yet it
shouldn't be that way

466
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,870
I its technically illegal because you're
supposed to at least in

467
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,110
the company that I work for there's very
good asking your benefit and they're all

468
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,190
clear if you do his job with your salary
period

469
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,710
no exceptions yes so

470
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,250
he

471
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,470
agree really hard years and you

472
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,669
here win

473
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:53,750
you were who is a

474
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,890
you reach their race

475
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:01,690
at very search here

476
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,210
27 miles on track it because

477
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,350
Russian rushed very aggressive beans for
me

478
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,919
yeah but why is that males huge

479
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,750
rape it

480
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,330
my I honestly I think it's probably hard
for men to do that too

481
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,460
I mean I think it's hard for anybody to
be a ser assertive in that way when the

482
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,130
time comes South I

483
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:28,360
yeah maybe maybe there is this

484
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,570
I mean this is our perceptions think so
it of course it's hard for

485
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:37,279
from and to I'm that one problem is the
perception of society of a person doing

486
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:37,860
this

487
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,919
and if a man does this people sometimes

488
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,240
CEO this is a strong man and his recipe

489
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,700
goes with dole's but if a woman does
this some people may think

490
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,809
O'Sheas overly aggressive and why does
she not like

491
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:54,669
my issue not a team player so I i've
seen this

492
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:58,260
discuss I mean I I would never agree
with that perception but i've seen this

493
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,500
discussion sometimes that

494
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,669
society perceives us based on the role
we have 22 Aug 10

495
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:07,630
gender and it's over simplifying wrong
no question

496
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,490
it is but as the situation be meeting
agree on it up for me if I see a woman

497
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,860
doing that I think well

498
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:19,200
and time yeah okay ten men perceive that
one in his in like

499
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,350
yeah it one

500
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,789
when the things that a southern talk but
Josh's comment

501
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:29,640
way way way way long ago and no
comebacks this pay she

502
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,799
I'm I've worked large organizations
which had very

503
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:36,830
strong a commitment to

504
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,159
women T and when I had stuff

505
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,190
who basically said I don't work for Sun
circuses woman under said well

506
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,200
I have to train everybody I'm not trying
everybody

507
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,150
if you don't be a part of our team

508
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,910
at the end of the day we should never
ever plan the woman

509
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,040
for the negative reactions assignment
which is the thing that judge was saying

510
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,330
he get hurt for

511
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:01,640
having a quota system whatever it is
psych racism

512
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,130
you basically have to call it out you
have to say that is not OK

513
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,560
we're not gonna respond to that we're
gonna do this

514
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,600
and to my mind that also comes that's
the pay quality thing and

515
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,830
in a stray we have a thing where people
don't talk about pay and this is

516
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,400
actually a

517
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,150
establish where women don't know what
their male colleagues having paid so

518
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,470
that I know what to ask for

519
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:26,570
so I know that as a manager we paid
everybody the same sort of levels

520
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,490
you need to two and a half percent
bonuses every year or whatever but the

521
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,430
pace was different and

522
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:36,110
my mind that's something that needs to
change people need to talk openly about

523
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,180
what they get paid said there is no

524
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:42,570
hidden differential because at the time
that pet that

525
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:47,370
pay difference your someone at a senior
level much fifty thousand dollars worth

526
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:53,759
of the year for the same work and that's
not OK

527
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,519
trap

528
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,109
here I'm here's

529
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:05,190
looked losing well

530
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,700
he

531
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,679
him

532
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:18,919
hinge human

533
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:25,259
him

534
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:29,989
school

535
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:34,959
he from

536
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:40,469
he he

537
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:51,809
hip his I

538
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:55,379
he year

539
00:33:55,379 --> 00:34:00,389
he he

540
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:07,009
actually him how much you

541
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:10,569
and it is more you maybe they should
just just give everyone the maxim that

542
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:11,520
new place

543
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,639
yeah with another

544
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:24,200
here this year her shouldn't

545
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,619
who like nations

546
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:34,629
mayor and good

547
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:38,270
I by the way I disagree with that
statement

548
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,049
I think there's our of a lot of really
great so for example coming out of

549
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:41,460
Europe

550
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,379
that I think in many ways rivals was
coming out of the valley music

551
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:49,480
yep yes release forms I think

552
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,210
you know that that is a factual thing at
the moment where the money is

553
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,629
is also where the motivation is and it
is still there sorry

554
00:34:56,629 --> 00:35:00,750
way he

555
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,740
I didn't do it it's not let me be very
clear like I mean it

556
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,880
I hate when I first got this opportunity
KPN

557
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,200
and the way that I got this job I'll be
really open about it

558
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,990
I am I got called I had just had a third

559
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,460
a child I was planning on changing my
life is working at Verizon

560
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:22,279
and so I got called in to and from a
headhunting coming called a contender

561
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:25,380
I said well you know thanks but no
thanks I am NOT

562
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,500
it's too complex I've got a job already
am gonna go back to it I know it

563
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,420
I have done it it's good and KPN was
just hacked

564
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,609
so I knew that whatever the hell I was
getting into its gonna be a big pile of

565
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:37,759
poo in stinky

566
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:42,279
so that mahila already has a

567
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:45,539
a child I knew that from the other two
that meant a lot to the

568
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:48,589
months of no sleep so how was I gonna do
a new job

569
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:51,789
new baby no sleep and lots o

570
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:55,680
network in a very big company up to me
and people so

571
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,720
I am. for said no they contacted you
right

572
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,099
the following up the right person for
the job today political environment

573
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:07,259
really difficult need facing a little
person so then and it was in the money

574
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:12,260
it was the fact that someone told me
that I couldn't do it there

575
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,780
I'm very well in the world

576
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,860
it so the but the point is that when
they got me the

577
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,650
the actual salary offer at I was new I
couldn't even

578
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:26,200
be bothered to look at it on it right
away add because I want to do the

579
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,940
challenge that they thought I couldn't
do

580
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,460
and we're not three years after I I took
the job

581
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,760
and KPN is recognized in fact in the
last row G session

582
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,310
our CEO said now we have the internal
security on order to

583
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:42,180
all our stakeholders everything else and
this is at Dylan I hate to come

584
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,600
two-tone porn fame but what do you think
of KPMG think Ive

585
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,720
Kb and security idea to you government
of ideas for the back on top in the

586
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,260
United

587
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,830
did those who the address and stuff from
you who have made a difference

588
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:58,070
after hacking team is really good we
just competed in the Def Con

589
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:01,270
a we came outta nowhere okay we had no
team

590
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:06,070
and in the deadpan qualifier within 100
teams we came in the top three

591
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:11,000
when yeah it's

592
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,260
notices to a question so into a lake
going back to charge

593
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,460
question I think laying in terms of say

594
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,890
women now say they can weather or worse
can do whether sort of

595
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:26,450
actionable items you like to see
happening because we talk about

596
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,610
conferences

597
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,690
and that you know women are not take

598
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,760
with I know creating like Korean

599
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,250
sort of helping women to be in this
election committee

600
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,270
be something that he's a

601
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:44,270
you know and toward possible to the

602
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:49,350
at you know at the organizing committee
they with other actions we could do

603
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:54,410
I think blanket be together yeah I like
to think that that would you that point

604
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,620
that you made it was excellent and II
encourages a lot of

605
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:09,509
female interested x1 okay

606
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:22,309
it

607
00:38:22,309 --> 00:38:32,830
yes

608
00:38:32,830 --> 00:39:04,620
yes

609
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,170
said

610
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:09,900
said

611
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,180
here

612
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,480
his I think

613
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,160
the guys from rucksack red impact of
pain yeah

614
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,350
account societal change info call if you
have a lot of email about this event

615
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:29,990
yeah have been acting on hold

616
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:54,100
said PC

617
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,460
do you know what melanie is doing it
radically obscuring

618
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,790
Lucas she's just pretty much embodies
everything you just said

619
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:04,030
yeah we can talk the head

620
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:09,080
maybe there is us once a question the
back turned back I just rally to

621
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,480
to just like it and and gonna skip

622
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,490
what can we do I'm I want to talk about
more about means because

623
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:19,580
the blind she fears Esq it's a good idea
but

624
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,590
the problem and I see from my point of
view

625
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,930
is that their few women actually in

626
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:29,690
absecon general in the last person may
be a relief

627
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:33,890
45 lady how they are different but not
today I'm not talking about today but

628
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,720
yesterday in a

629
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,210
women I've exchanged with her so
yesterday it was really one

630
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:42,820
go with with whom I talked about
technical stuff so

631
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,930
or two the worst but the so the problem

632
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:50,250
its from a statistic point of view and
I'm and I'm really a statistic

633
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,250
oddity you know I'm multi-cultural and
multi-religious

634
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:57,590
the I'm I'm not an engineer so when I
look for when I look for our

635
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,630
for job that was realistic sickly
impossible but

636
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:04,320
let's talk about cystic if we do a blind
a blank

637
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,420
a plant began blindly a you won't have
as many chances to get

638
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,470
full Board of men or a full borders
women

639
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,750
I getting back to to the fact that we
are in

640
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,970
IT security you know back in the days
when we were all chatting without

641
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,250
with no avatar than Facebook's on
LinkedIn and self even

642
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:26,720
and it's a trial or just or just so does
you know we were just nicknames

643
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,530
and nobody cared and would work so I I
know that there are many many ladies

644
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,480
many men

645
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,800
and inward with good technique

646
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,690
capabilities so if the if they is
submitted to me

647
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:44,900
to %uh spun by chain thingy some crazy
audited only men get pickup

648
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,330
Whitby will it will it not feel I could
is not a quota system here good

649
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,530
is not the fact that regulating
regulating what

650
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:56,000
what just what talked about you maybe it
may be good

651
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,520
in this point and I'm not telling you to
regulate

652
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,420
to regulate only women dresses but like
we do in France now for religion

653
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,170
purposes will be lit everything every
religion we don't it's not cheap it

654
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:10,980
but this may be the but bust that

655
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:25,700
so I think side I don't think people
clad nice

656
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:33,660
here

657
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,030
but if in the main menu has a lot more
women

658
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:39,390
actually talking to the show that there
probably is a biased with men

659
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,619
my so conscious or whatever us you

660
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:46,770
did but but if I think we need to have a
suggestion

661
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,430
because we're running out of time exit
if I may ask you on

662
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,819
I mean one thing is we select but what
can we do

663
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:58,069
to get more submission and more
engagement from women here community

664
00:42:58,069 --> 00:43:02,410
to come to or worse and and like so we
can actually also then select them

665
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:06,099
i mean one yeah I'm easily have been
hard hit me tell you he don't get so

666
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:06,730
many

667
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:10,630
and if we could increase the up high %uh
the

668
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,890
the number of people then we can also
have more

669
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:17,510
diversity in the community I think so
what do you think can we do

670
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,829
to make that at the Italian rejected
yeah I wonder if you can find them

671
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:25,160
you know their appetite possible image
have to make it a point to going to

672
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,359
reach out to them and make them aware
that you're looking for content as well

673
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:31,819
and white building comes because they
were gone XY and that would you find

674
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:32,349
interesting

675
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:35,500
yet that you do what we do in in the end
I mean we have here the selection

676
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,280
process but

677
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,319
to get people to something we're going
to invite people to come in

678
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:42,339
we do that too yet so that we have a
remote beach at

679
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:45,549
getting women me know what you did when
you had the all

680
00:43:45,549 --> 00:43:48,770
a women keynote that was actually
brilliant

681
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:52,109
because I've never seen so many women
just walking around a conference and

682
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:56,020
I think it's a two-track solution I
think you need a temporary solution that

683
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:56,950
you can be the first

684
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:00,780
X amount of time until you have been
reach some sort of normality

685
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,309
and then once you've had that normalcy
then the Dutch the fully double-blind is

686
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:05,690
the only thing that really fair

687
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,599
but when it comes to it it should be a
meritocracy we should be looking at

688
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,780
quality and not gender so cap

689
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,100
T month

690
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,950
of course the Sunday night is going to
be spread into the conference

691
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,360
SL sentiments of on on that bombshell

692
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,840
we're running out of time in congress
track i'm happy to let it let

693
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,890
run on but for those people that want to
go to lunch

694
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:34,820
it is being serve and if you walk out
please remember to films

695
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:38,880
with a degree in a red card in the box
and if you guys want to continue this

696
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,540
discussion

697
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,870
I'm fine the room is set available for
any

698
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:46,050
just one more last comment and your
question

699
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,310
about the selection committee
influencing that

700
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:53,140
is a very easy average and that will
ensure that at least

701
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:58,630
for that part that those can mmm

702
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,450
then it is more women's get involved in
an organization 11 they may say to you

703
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,380
know the things in

704
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:07,640
just occur the people just just on a
closing though I want

705
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,560
find out how it did the majority of
operations lost his ex you also female

706
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,170
so be

707
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:18,060
it's not like me we would like
discriminate against that actually we

708
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:21,170
very much want to encourage that and
that's also the reason why we have this

709
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:21,720
panel

710
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,120
because we feel this is really important
and we want to increase

711
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,150
the diversity of my community engender

712
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:31,390
Indian other dimensions as well so this
is really

713
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:35,490
very close to a hardened we just need to
know what we can do

714
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,720
we need to look for you that sorry was
really good

715
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,760
that's really good can I think this
panel needs to

716
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,440
need sleep loss for moderating it
difficult products

717
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,060
on a studio audience as well we wouldn't
have had a good discussion with AE so

718
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,060
and text you on taking the time to come
here and organizes out for

719
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,670
have been making a comfortable lead
thanks

720
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:05,620
thank you think

721
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,570
make a comment yeah okay as I read
