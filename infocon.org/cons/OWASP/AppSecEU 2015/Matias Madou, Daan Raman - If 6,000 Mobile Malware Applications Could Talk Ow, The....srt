1
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,090
everybody for staying it's a it's lunch
time so I know it's hard for you to

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,980
to to be here on an empty stomach

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,849
so really appreciated that that you take
the time to

4
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:23,250
listen to a talk I'm so today you would
like to talk about

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,550
some of our research we started two
years ago and we would like to present

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,210
the results on that research

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,309
first of all I would like to introduce
our our souls

8
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,040
on so my name is a modest Madhu right
now I meant

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,479
in V's oh and I'm running the software
security practices so

10
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,899
arm what we essentially do you have a a
focus on financial institutions

11
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,190
mainly in Belgium where we provide
software security

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,439
a help with what they try to achieve

13
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:53,839
within the financial institutions before
that I was

14
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:57,159
at fortify which was later acquired by
HP a

15
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:02,150
where I've filled out various roles in
in research 22 product management

16
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,439
to a actually various roles within

17
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,860
within fortify and within HP on

18
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,220
how they roll into fortify well a

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,509
before i doing for if I was doing a PhD
at on on application security at

20
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:21,290
at Ghent University or where I studied
code obfuscation through static analysis

21
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,650
and through that static analysis angle I
rolled into fortified with

22
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:30,180
with their issue product and I like to
speak at at various conferences

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,930
that's my slight so I'm done

24
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,950
I'm also security researcher at the
movies O

25
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,729
so if you the project that we focus on
his or malware scanner

26
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:45,290
that's basically the focus of 2d
presentation we also have cyber security

27
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:45,930
challenge

28
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,600
Belgium so it's an event that you're
organized to attract students and

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,470
so that we can cherry pick the best from
the University and be also be quite some

30
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,100
picking one ATM's but that's not

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,439
the topic of to the so if you for the
ATM's you can sneak out now

32
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,570
so a.m.

33
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,900
what would be like to talk about today
well

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,479
we would like to talk about now where
and Android so the combination of

35
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,610
mahler in and written that's essentially
what a

36
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,650
what the outline of today is so we we
first I'll try to figure out like a

37
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,710
whole

38
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,120
big is the problem with mahler and and
how big overall

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,860
those Android play in that after that we
gonna look at

40
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,670
Ariba case can that we designed and and
that is free to use on

41
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,870
on our website and we also created
public API so that he can

42
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,360
use and you can upload samples and can
scan them so that it's it's more

43
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,300
convenient for you

44
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,840
then we go to the statistics so don is
going to take over and got talk a little

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,440
bit about

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,620
the mahler that we found the various
types of Mahler not be found a

47
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,200
everything around statistics essentially
and we also talk about

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,530
future work a century do love
collaborations with universities in

49
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,130
Belgium

50
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,380
worst where we work closely together
with the students and you would like to

51
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,140
improve this whole project so that
everybody benefits from it okay

52
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,840
low molar um yes

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,409
I'm sorry

54
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:18,430
you yet

55
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,450
I am we focus and even andrew there's a
few statistics on the the sharemarket

56
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,510
right so

57
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,150
basically the share file US versus
Android accuser so

58
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,849
and rate is the largest platform so
that's already reason to focus their

59
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:35,650
also the up okie ecosystem on the on
Android is a bit more vulnerable

60
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,390
the way up so deployed into the markets
there's third party app markets

61
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,140
that make it that makes it quite a bit
more dangerously

62
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,290
exposes the use the user there's also
the permission model

63
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,900
that's quite different than I resident
on Android that's also covered in the

64
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,769
presentation

65
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:53,859
I'm said think that'll become a bit more
clearer

66
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:58,280
through the slides yeah so what we see
right now is

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,370
is more and more the movement from a

68
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,670
know when those smaller to wear towards
mobile phone so

69
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,569
says you can ask yourself why kayy
ordered attackers interested in in

70
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:12,540
writing mahler for the mobile phones
well the the truth of the matter is

71
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,269
right now we do more and more things on
your mobile.phone we do banking which

72
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:17,739
which

73
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,970
what we've not what we not did before we
asked for cabs

74
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,310
arm we we buy stuff over the internet so
we do more and more of our

75
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,770
day-to-day life on a mobile phone and
that's essentially what the hackers are

76
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,330
going after because more money moves
over your phone so if they can steal

77
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,139
some of that

78
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,870
well that's quite interesting for soap
as you can see it it pops up in

79
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,190
in the news quite a lot but then still
the question comes like a

80
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,220
how why is essentially your question
like a why do you focus on Android and

81
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,520
really what we see right now is this
huge view room

82
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,090
in Android devices if you look at market
share simple market share

83
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,000
on android devices they they were up to
eighty percent and only 20 percent goes

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,810
to the other

85
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,410
iPhone Blackberry Microsoft and maybe
some others home

86
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,830
someone East usable I am

87
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,490
lumen sorry who is not using a US or
enjoy it

88
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,630
who is not using Windows Phone

89
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,510
those looking nobody how one person
using I

90
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,020
I you have a partner in the room I

91
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,490
Creek so if if we look at then the
distribution like if you if you throw

92
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,010
all my learning to one bucket then gonna
split up so how much is

93
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,280
is is Android malware and how much is
win those mahler and

94
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,550
what is the other book it and if you do
that arm

95
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,710
a alcatel-lucent figured out that right
now sixty percent of the mahler if you

96
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,590
ever thought

97
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,760
so everything in one bucket is really
Android mahler

98
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,890
and only forty percent is windows so it
is really taking over windows

99
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,960
and less than one percent is all the
other devices

100
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,450
and and that's that's I think

101
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,230
again confirmed by others like for
instance of a slap CCK what we see a lot

102
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,010
we see a huge bike right now

103
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,720
in the number of samples of of Android
mahler

104
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,460
and that's what we see so this graph
goes up to January 2014 but you see

105
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,120
these these rapid increase of

106
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,770
malware that's coming out for Android
one thing so what we focus on with with

107
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,870
visa is really

108
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,540
the the financials and and mainly in
Belgium

109
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,380
so for us it's really interesting to
figure out like a how much of that

110
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,110
Mahler really focuses the

111
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,750
that the banking sector to financials
and what we see is over there like

112
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,830
00 also a rapid increase and in

113
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,190
I number of samples of Mahler 442
financial institution and that's exactly

114
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,460
where we would like to focus on so we
would like to focus on like a

115
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,860
why is there such a rapid increase in in
android what is that particular piece of

116
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,900
Mahler doing

117
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,300
how can you spot pieces of Mahler and so
on and so forth

118
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,440
alright mahler analysis

119
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,160
um there are various ways to do mahler
analysis and and

120
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,180
broadly speaking what we focused on was

121
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,460
on static analysis and behavior analysis
so static analysis really is for you

122
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,240
you take the the the the AP K and you do
not

123
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,480
executed right so you just gonna look at
the cold and you gonna try to figure out

124
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,930
what that code is doing you can build a
model

125
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,990
you can use grad and you gonna try to
figure out a what that

126
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,530
what is that code doing and is that
doing something militias I love

127
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,820
advantages like a

128
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,500
I if it's if it's in there if it's baked
in there you can simply

129
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,730
find it if you can fingerprinted has
some problems to you know like there's

130
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,010
these

131
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,870
obfuscate there's for for Android a
decks guard and stuff like that

132
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,750
so if if it's obfuscate it's harder to
inspect of course because

133
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,670
all the cold is mingled on also stuff
that happens at runtime

134
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,820
will not show up through static analysis
because you're not executing at all

135
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,470
behavior analysis will fix all these
problems

136
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,120
alright but it has all the problems and
of course so behavior analysis will this

137
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,590
lead

138
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,360
well something shows up at runtime you
will definitely see it right I'll

139
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,410
on the other hand it has some problems
like sometimes its law

140
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:11,070
also if you do not execute a particular
part of well you'll not gonna find it

141
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,630
right so if you're not executing the
mahler if you do not know how to tackle

142
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,400
the mahler

143
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,080
then you're not gonna find a piece of
mollering have a love examples on that

144
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,430
too

145
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,950
so quick reminder

146
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,830
how do you create an Android ABK so you
take your source

147
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,950
you compile it did your Java compiler
then you go to to the

148
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,960
to developing by Coates is very similar
to Java

149
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,159
you building into an Android package he
signed it and you

150
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,539
threw it onto the Google Play Store arm
one remark of course is that

151
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,360
that's going to be replaced with a.m.
eart

152
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,010
but how do you go back so what are we
looking at right now so we take the

153
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,900
safety case

154
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,500
unzip them so we have some don't think
bytecode user

155
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,380
to call Dexter jar to go back to Java
and you use

156
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,740
%uh tools like gee decoder GT you re to
really look at the Java code and that's

157
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,570
what we're using for static analysis

158
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,240
engine so we really go back to the
source code and the source code

159
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,220
is what we're using for static analysis
or really on that source code to start

160
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,290
building a model

161
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,970
we apply a analysis and then we figure
out if there's

162
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,460
mahler in there or not we also do
behavior analysis

163
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,640
I am soul what we do over there is is we

164
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,750
be to took the team droid

165
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,950
an we modified it a little bit so

166
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,770
well a little bit heavily essentially to
a make sure that we got more analysis in

167
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,040
there certainly getting good we got some
screen capturing in there

168
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,040
%uh so we really modified team droid so
we

169
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,089
executed the application itself

170
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:49,910
and in the background he also inserted
some ok so we can get some information

171
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,180
out of 10 good moral of what currently
available

172
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,209
so we get all sorts of information out
there what we also do what you can see

173
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:57,850
on the screen

174
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,250
is we click stuff okay because normally
if you run into leader

175
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,800
and its all automated well if nobody
clicks anything well

176
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,050
nothing gonna nothing is going to happen
so we what we do over here

177
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,660
is we randomly click the screen so that
it's going to execute some parts of

178
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,870
course this can be

179
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,980
I'm this get this can be better but if
you want to scale that if you want to do

180
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,200
that for a hundred thousand applications
I cannot ass like a student to

181
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,709
constantly tap the screen and figure out
all the past so what we've done is on

182
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,940
some random a generated I just randomly
clicked the screen

183
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,339
right

184
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,690
so

185
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,310
what we see right now is in if we if we

186
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,650
took if you take a BK so we see right
now is that

187
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,570
fingerprinting Muller is no longer

188
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,130
viable so right now what we see is that
the the mahler becomes more and more

189
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,130
sophisticated

190
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,890
essentially when you download an app

191
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,400
what the that the people are sometimes
doing a few to try to download the

192
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,339
militias ap

193
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:03,470
is they try to make unique a

194
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,709
application for you so that
fingerprinting no longer works

195
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:10,390
and and the way to do that is is first
of all they send you to a different link

196
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,140
and they make

197
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,020
a different copy over them its a lot
done through

198
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,459
I'm sorry it's a lot done through

199
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:21,499
using different keys if you can clip
your ABK

200
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:25,799
using different steps in the appt itself
so what they're trying to do is

201
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,529
they have some sort of a library of
pieces of code that are the same

202
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:33,239
rather have the same functionality and
the using this hoping that in and out so

203
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:36,369
that is very hard to create a
fingerprint on that one particular

204
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:39,910
application so that's something your
sorry just wanted to give

205
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,139
even one very simple example BC samples
were

206
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:48,279
a single text file this attitude is up
with the Rams 3056 characters and that

207
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,720
of course changes the hash

208
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,329
a of the entire application that this
even

209
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:57,949
sufficient to bypass lot of anti-virus
that of course is done just going to

210
00:11:57,949 --> 00:11:58,729
fingerprint

211
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:01,739
Tpke and see I'm done with it I don't
know this sample

212
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:06,039
submitted for analysis so even those
very basic checks can

213
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:10,649
can already buy perceive me um

214
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,959
I think this is one of the the first
that we me found the local server

215
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,139
polymorphism on and an

216
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:22,029
once he founded well first of all nano
the 57

217
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:25,499
the scanners that that that that
otherwise trying to figure out if

218
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:28,959
they're smaller dis the 57 that we
looked at were not able to find it

219
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,829
but if you execute it so what we do is
really executing in an emulator

220
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:35,980
we were able to spot this particular
piece of of Mahler

221
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,249
and and hotspot Shield and what they did
essentially so we

222
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:43,049
dug a little deeper in there that would
be used with the use different keys to

223
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:44,720
essentially encrypt the ABK

224
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,899
also include the traffic that goes over
the wire so even if you

225
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:52,559
a try to figure out the traffic over the
wire if you know one of these keys will

226
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,970
you can the crypt 10 that particular
stream but if they use fifteen 15

227
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,709
different ones and you only know 1

228
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,869
well they're still fourteen different
flavors that you cannot

229
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:04,129
find I am

230
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:08,029
another and I think this is the still
the same sample

231
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:11,559
so what we've done in their is we've
taken various

232
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:15,109
arm a samples that that that were

233
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:19,199
encoded in a different way or or packed
in a different way

234
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,679
we on extracted them and we started
looking for for information

235
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:27,250
on an essentially what we saw through or
emulator is

236
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,770
these pieces of data that were created
internally

237
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,850
and then encrypt and send over the wire
and when we do some

238
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,690
some Google search we actually figured
out that there was some some java file

239
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,760
with this particular

240
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,910
a mahler information in there so they
were using some snippets

241
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,530
of of known dollar um

242
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:52,240
monkey jumpers I think the first one
that we found that server site

243
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,970
polymorphism

244
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,590
yep that was seen as one it was the one
with the very first abs that was

245
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,350
uploaded

246
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,400
to ABK scan that was malicious so you're
quite

247
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,950
excited time we saw that one coming in
I'm what

248
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,980
this one is doing is in the background
so the Mahler is in the background

249
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,010
sending

250
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,460
the text 22 premium numbers and

251
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,710
arm we've taken that one

252
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,120
mahler sample and then we actually went
back to our to our

253
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,689
a

254
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:25,319
bucket of all applications and you try
to figure out like a how many of the

255
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:28,009
same applications have the same the same
piece of Mahler

256
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:32,079
and found more of them so we found way
more all that same piece of Mahler

257
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,850
encoded in the from very but they were
all doing the same thing which was

258
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,389
sending

259
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:39,850
a takes two to premium membership that's
also fully functional games at

260
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,610
just through denies taken from the App
Store its Trojan I so that people leave

261
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,399
it on the phone

262
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,259
it's a fun game and while you're playing
those text messages are being sent

263
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:53,249
in later versions of love Android right
now you actually see

264
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:56,480
a message saying look you're about to
send the message through an app

265
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,660
to Pete number do you want to do this so
that's partially mitigated with

266
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,889
with your hood its alright

267
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:07,119
AP case can itself yet didn't think
there's a question

268
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:15,600
so

269
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,860
I'm so we have to repeat the question so
serious that is asking like what do we

270
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,480
do with

271
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,730
with the with the malicious app so if we
find something licious what do we do

272
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,050
with

273
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,189
it depends if it's applauded by user who
is anonymous well

274
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:32,509
we can look for it in stores but very
often we don't find any traces of it

275
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:36,600
on the other hand if it's an unofficial
apps or we also put in

276
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,610
samples ourselves actively the scan them
be

277
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,249
actually can do takedown requests if it
smaller and we do that activity

278
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:47,860
and also for our clients we actually
monitor

279
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,550
yep stores for their blog Brent we take
apart all the ZP case we look for local

280
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,160
abuse

281
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,290
it's a very serious issue like banking
Trojan then we

282
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,470
me take active measures and we call tech
2 stores most of the time they've taken

283
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,089
the

284
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:04,439
taken out the store Sudan 24 hours yeah

285
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:08,720
and even in the Google Play Store they
can remove samples are already installed

286
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,350
on the phone

287
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,620
for a TD up so that's quite quite

288
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,959
powerful functionality does that answer
the question

289
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,649
cook so we started two years ago

290
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:22,970
with with a in visa or in the I with
with

291
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,110
our scanner which we call it the case
can and you can use it freely online so

292
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,600
we can

293
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,360
if you if you think you have some peace
mahler you can upload it over there

294
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,750
gonna scan to give you all the results
back so it's it's very different from

295
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,230
from other scanners were to keep most of
this the information himself we really

296
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,589
share everything that we know about that
application

297
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:46,019
on and so we we've implemented static
analysis and behavior analysis and right

298
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,040
now we

299
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,190
we've scanned up to 30,000 unique
samples and that's really when we

300
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,930
submitted this this proposal right now
we're

301
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,269
were up way more because we have to
collaborate with more

302
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:02,589
a research and development organizations
on sharing information sharing samples

303
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:06,990
us so we we see way more right now also
I at that time when I submitted

304
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,329
when we submitted to talk you have
thirty thousand examples and six

305
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,209
thousand of them

306
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:14,299
were pieces of Mahler and that's why we
came up with

307
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:18,740
with that particular title um and and
use can't be scanned them

308
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,480
we share everything with the community
very very quickly high-level how there's

309
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,150
a work I'm not gonna spend too much time
on that because you want to go to the

310
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:25,839
details

311
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,010
so since you you have to you have to
make it as you can upload something and

312
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,700
you gonna scan it for you but we also
actively pull from

313
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,770
various stores and the scan the ATK what
we do

314
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,870
what's very interesting I think is I

315
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,679
in the background a in the background
over here

316
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,990
we have various workers so we have
various workers

317
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,870
and why do we do that well for example
what we see is if an application

318
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:55,380
is is is opened in a different country
sometimes you have a different screen so

319
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,870
for

320
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,510
for malware based on the country you're
in

321
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,950
they gonna show you a different banking
app a

322
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,720
of course and ap or or a bank that works
and that is operating in that particular

323
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,410
company and in that particular

324
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,330
a country so same is true for

325
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,679
for devices some of these devices
contain a

326
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,169
vulnerabilities that are exploited by
the mahler so for instance if it's on

327
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:20,390
the Nexus its only were

328
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,010
its it only works for a Nexus so we
really have to have an emulator

329
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,860
for Nexus specific mahler otherwise you
will not find a different are always

330
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,419
using

331
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:30,600
a

332
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,840
another device we're not gonna find that
a rig we're not gonna identify that

333
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,220
AP K as a piece of Mahler so right now
we have a very is workers various and

334
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,919
leaders

335
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,919
yes you also have hardware devices so
physical device is very executed ATT's

336
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:46,240
on

337
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,110
and we'll be trying to figure out what
that ATK is doing and if it's malicious

338
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,370
alright only voted no

339
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,450
thanks an the clip

340
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,840
to you thank you so if you set the
sticks I'm

341
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,409
overall we analyze about 50,000

342
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:08,840
aP's when the released the the

343
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,909
the presentation so that's about half

344
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:15,320
those are you submit it to anonymous
samples that we just discussed

345
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,419
the other one the other half is really
something that we

346
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:22,970
actively pullin from third-party app
stores we sometimes can through the

347
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,270
Google Play Store

348
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,289
but they have quite a bit of
restrictions on that they don't like

349
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:31,289
actively people screaming their content
obviously they have their

350
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:34,620
own bouncer it's cool to implementation
of a scanner

351
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,380
some also the samples are really found
in the wild and third-party app stores

352
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,100
planned activity to give you an overview
about

353
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,409
through in a 50 unique samples today
a.m.

354
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:49,590
overall so most of these come from up
stores

355
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,929
and real already quite a bit up there
its think

356
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:57,059
150 units samples that we have the to
use a prude so

357
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:00,580
does anyone have an idea why we quit FB
huge drop

358
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,610
rounds that Lester

359
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,330
part of the don't know how to point with
this one here

360
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:12,510
its anyone wants to take a guess yeah

361
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,030
the bill is just at 1 p.m. certainly we
saw a huge drop in traffic

362
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,580
basically reader another disk space so

363
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,260
that was quite the panic it normally
gets like daily reports on Oprah the

364
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,630
samples certainly we got

365
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,640
hit someone to prove that one sample to
the and that was it

366
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,720
so we fix that's we started analyzing

367
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,520
am overall the food is something that we
analyzed about eight-percent the school

368
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:36,850
for

369
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:41,200
malicious seventy percent the suspicious
and you can already

370
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,890
guess a bit to get to grease the Aspire
where at the beer

371
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,490
sometimes difficult to know even up is
trying to help you

372
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,860
the orbits trying to maliciously track
you that's

373
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,290
that's about seventeen percent and I
seventy-five physical for rent

374
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,860
to continue newer malicious or meeting
creepers you

375
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,920
no he didn't identify anything so we
cannot report its

376
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,140
an overview the

377
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,000
that break down but then by user
submitted samples and the App Store's

378
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,920
so we see

379
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,870
but four percent of the apps that we put
in from the App Store's all malicious

380
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,950
if you only look at the Google Play
Store we sometimes get that question its

381
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,630
much less than that sits the we below 1
percent

382
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,050
it's still a lot of people are getting
apps through third-party channel so we

383
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,000
think that's a that's a fair comparison

384
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,100
I am we get to about 12 percent there is

385
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,790
yet militias from user uploads I well
mostly researchers are using our service

386
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,870
the already has

387
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,330
have a suspicion on that mission is open
up I'm

388
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,740
we got the blues from all over the world
this is just a nice

389
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,870
graph but I'll skip it and the

390
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,550
mother signatures that we gets overall
most of them are really Trojans

391
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,340
so apps there are we being repackaged
think about that monkey

392
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,840
game that we just showed you users

393
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,460
leave that Apple devices because
persistent and in the background is

394
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,480
doing all kinds of a

395
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,760
malicious activity that shields
application that I search shoot

396
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,740
that's exactly the same air pollution
that's the

397
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,270
yet that's really malware a.m. it's
between mother and had to be there

398
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,270
it's a bit difficult to say but it's
quite persistent atrial

399
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,660
suspicious get agreed there's still a
lot of some bills that we cannot

400
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:34,030
categorize basically and we see for
example that it's something else

401
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,760
personal identifying information over
the wire at serine time

402
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,230
but no idea what the purpose is it could
be ads which could be

403
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:47,550
commanding control a difficult to see
and then here we have a a pie chart so

404
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:52,300
summarizes a bit the results if you look
at exploits that was a bit of a surprise

405
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,810
to us

406
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:57,180
less than two percent of all the lower
some things that we analyze

407
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:02,580
use an exploit with device almost all of
the samples debuts the permission schema

408
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:08,800
on an Android phone so top 10
permissions request and I'll just give

409
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,510
you seconds to look through these

410
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:17,390
the to see if you recognize a few them
can be sure of

411
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:21,440
do show a fence again if the Android
users yet

412
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,120
quite a lot so internet X is an utter
Texas

413
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,170
the phone States the WiFi access those
are really the

414
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:34,240
the usual suspects so what do we do we
try to look for permissions that are

415
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,040
requested considerably more of my mobile
rather than good to hear

416
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,070
nunnery a look at this definitional
dangerous permissions

417
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,300
then we get the quite interesting view

418
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,450
BC permissions that our request that
much more freakin by malware

419
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:54,600
so what's there receive would complete
so that make smaller persistent

420
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,180
I'm so whenever

421
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,440
the phone is rebooted after the
installation of the up

422
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,800
the mother supplicant get the
notification and it can start to a good

423
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,920
stopping itself

424
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,600
reading the phone states that Sri to
leak personal identifying information

425
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,860
or technical details about the phone
typically used to track user

426
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,340
to send back to command and control look
this phone checked in

427
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,820
lick your location

428
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,920
we also see more and more amount was
that is leaking but also history

429
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,140
your processes contact Google account
details

430
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,690
so it's becoming much more interesting

431
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,940
for a sample to aggregate all the
information send it to command the

432
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,950
control server

433
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,790
and even based on what is sent back
taken on this site if the further

434
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,160
track you if the you remove the malware
remotely from the system

435
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,340
you've seen those %uh the synthesis in
North Andover course

436
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,610
leaking text messages

437
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,650
typically banking Trojans and we
actually see an example that's

438
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:03,870
in that and if you slights so at least
forty percent of the dangers permissions

439
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,310
at the first conclusion

440
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,610
are directly linked deformation the each
that's quite scary

441
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:13,450
because it's difficult to categorize and
up is being malicious or good to be here

442
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,760
based on the hit show defies information
rights

443
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,220
it could just be in up registering your
im a number

444
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,800
at to say look at this device has been
ruled it's perfectly

445
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,030
adjustable to do the for certain
applications

446
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:31,670
so that's really ends up in the bucket
of suspicious applications but quite

447
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,450
often the also bypass

448
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,930
a.m. the Google bouncer so they end up
in the Google Play Store

449
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,880
an overview of all the information that
we've seen leaks

450
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,640
call looks is an interesting one so Fu
overview of the numbers that you've

451
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,230
dialed

452
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:52,730
the including the the call time so how
often do we see this information leakage

453
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,770
well overall

454
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,310
issued in about 40 percent of all
samples across

455
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,940
across AP case comes that's about 50,000
apps that we scant

456
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,970
if you only look at the suspicious a
malicious category then it's more than

457
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:06,780
half of them

458
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,180
that leaks device identifying
information

459
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,930
so based on stuff that the leak they can
uniquely identify your phone

460
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:18,160
I'll give all the phones that or that
exist on planet Earth

461
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,860
how is that leaked well there's a lot of
information persisted home

462
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,280
the drive from the not to the point send
out over the network

463
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,500
in very few cases we see that it's
leaked over SMS

464
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,760
quite often I think that's don't to to
test or some books to see what we are

465
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,640
what kind of a of less you're running I
am

466
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,789
in the seat on the right to the phone
numbers leads the team a decent number

467
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:48,720
even the accelerometer anyone has an
idea why someone

468
00:26:48,720 --> 00:27:02,110
but take root want to know the position
of the Excel early to creative guesses

469
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,170
yet it could be

470
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:07,300
that the take over the phone whenever
the phone is not moving or maybe you'll

471
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,230
have your own to

472
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,270
yep the Star Trek you maybe when you
move its

473
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:18,770
could be night I haven't seen its okie

474
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,720
you mean some books detection exactly
and that's and it's one of the examples

475
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,830
that we've seen

476
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,850
being you so the leak that the
accelerometer we did that

477
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,910
bit more looking to do some pills and
it's quite obvious that they try to

478
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:31,620
identify

479
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,470
are returning an emulator not so we need
to start using

480
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,090
be already have physical devices but you
need to put them on it does thats

481
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:44,090
that moves or something to bypass that
assembles detection

482
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:49,040
yes to move the seven books maybe some
summers

483
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,580
some bogus data through the acceptor
meter and

484
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,830
if there some other permissions in
that's at the post dangerous

485
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,970
once send and receive as a mess right is
a mess

486
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,460
those are really used to steal banking
tokens and to send

487
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,559
a.m. premium rates messages to

488
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,390
yet quite often Eastern European numbers
so intense good

489
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,200
conclusion of D's permissions is that 55
percent of the most request permissions

490
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,530
are also part of the top 10 of most
interest from permission so it makes it

491
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,690
very very difficult for user

492
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,730
to distinguish you can be installing

493
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:31,860
a normal malicious up and it's really
difficult base in the permission model

494
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,850
to know he can actually deduct from the
request permissions a bit smaller or not

495
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,940
and that's quite often the only
indication the user has a right

496
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:46,670
your your permission so that's quite
problematic think a good example of this

497
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:51,460
super bright let's fleshlight lifted up
for the presentation I think it's a

498
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,130
top-scoring flashlight up on the
official app store from Google

499
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,330
so the Play Store which permissions do
you think the Fleshlight requests and

500
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:11,140
I'll give you tips there is indeed a
permission to enable the flashlight

501
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,190
location

502
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:15,220
yep

503
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,490
at think those are we can actually do
permission bingo with this one

504
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,630
guess if you look at the the lists
intricate asks

505
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:27,110
for access to WiFi camera microphone
already no clue

506
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:31,650
why would do that for a flashlight up
received a to control the flashlight so

507
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,500
it's in there

508
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,580
nice so it probably works

509
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,870
yet

510
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,870
that's possible true letter Texas
retrieve

511
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,870
all your running ups the issue here in
up circles those kind of things that's

512
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,440
to me quite quite worrying

513
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,880
reading the phone States and still it's
an extremely popular app

514
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,990
yet

515
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,430
yep that's possible that so

516
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,510
that there's still quite a lot of things
there thing that

517
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,550
that could confuse user if they would
actually look into those permissions

518
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,630
be found one user so Miller very

519
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:16,840
deeply hidden in the Commons that said
what is it actually doing with my data

520
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,470
it's asking X's I just want a fleshlight

521
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,260
but all the other comments were I'm
really happy with the effort to its fine

522
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:24,680
but

523
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,760
who knows whatever it's doing in the
background right an

524
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,330
so I think that's really a wrap up of
that permission model it's still quite

525
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,320
difficult for users to judge

526
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,150
when installing an app and to see if
thats is legitimate or not

527
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,540
taken I'll US it's a bit easier
sometimes because

528
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,260
whenever the upstarts using the camera
you need to prove she can say look

529
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,870
it makes sense I'm trying to make a
profile picture and

530
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,350
the app can use a camera it's different
in this case

531
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,600
few interesting samples

532
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,940
speak to can this was already in the
screenshot of

533
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,610
or in them but I slights so fake talk is
trying to mimic the interface for Bank

534
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,900
of token generator

535
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,280
is basically going to intercept organs
and send them

536
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,340
over SMS or over over Internet to C&C
server

537
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,779
how

538
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:21,009
is it worked well the first thing the

539
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:24,929
was a prime the issue try to infect
users with third-party affected up

540
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:29,399
email to his party app store user clicks

541
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:34,859
the up register sweet as a mess an
ascent as a as in the permission model

542
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,899
the victims start communicating

543
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:41,460
a.m. with the in the affected phone

544
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,409
doctors are generated for online banking
those are intercepted

545
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:49,389
because remember the a prick West Texas
to incoming SMS messages

546
00:31:49,389 --> 00:31:54,849
therefore the to the bank of course
using at the victims

547
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:59,179
detectors account information and then
use can basically collect the money

548
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:02,359
it looks like a token generator

549
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:06,899
it doesn't actually generate bank tokens
even seen a few of these are the

550
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:08,950
developer of the mouth is so lazy

551
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,399
that it just generates a static 1 let's
not even regenerating in you

552
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:17,719
token upon clicking generates most of
them have some kind of randomness in

553
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:18,129
them

554
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:22,099
but I'll tell you they don't work in the
mucho banking apps

555
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:26,309
so that's

556
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:30,519
fake dugan you've seen that's one
actually quite a few times on the

557
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:35,859
on our scanner this one is quite

558
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:40,109
greedy if the interception of tokens for
some reason doesn't work

559
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:44,179
it can still steal your money by sending
text messages to premium numbers

560
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:49,119
so it's a bit to fall back sandbox
detection you already mentioned this

561
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,129
the before indeed to see quite a few
samples being

562
00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:56,200
a blow that trying to fingerprints or
some books or workers

563
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,460
in this case it was indeed analyzed by

564
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,739
a softphone sometime later we forgot to
change the name

565
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:07,279
of the emulator on and that

566
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,070
became quite easy for the researchers
have this paper to identify that they

567
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,389
were indeed some books

568
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:15,849
I'm on a physical phone this will not
show up in to again be

569
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:19,820
be a bit different but that's one of the
reasons why we picked a physical phone

570
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,339
right

571
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:23,599
becomes more difficult for him all
rights to it to identify that

572
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,690
is also it also means that they are
they're picking up or

573
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,810
scanner so even mahler riders are
picking up a scanner surfing

574
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,760
thinking like a how can we fingerprint a
peek a scam that the

575
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,130
cannot figure out that our piece of
software is a mahler

576
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:42,250
so that means or or or or scanners
really use also buy the bad guys they're

577
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,890
looking at this and figure allocate

578
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:46,920
what this AP case can figure out right
now

579
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,100
and they've even see versions like they
a PLO something out there

580
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,170
yeah got it pull the second version of
God and then the third version

581
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,730
where they sneak through our or scan and
then we have to figure out like he

582
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,850
how can be again to take what be just
read it so it's like a cat and mouse cat

583
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:06,270
yeah rescind its 45 for since all
militias militias listen then

584
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:10,460
ok it's good to hear and then this the
clothing and then they probably found

585
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,650
the banker or whatever they're doing
corruption that we cannot the

586
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:17,090
inspect it gets get them I'll scheme as
you mention

587
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,470
a good example of this historical
analysis

588
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,820
I'm what we do here is we also risk and
samples

589
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,280
so in this case we had a sample that
didn't look suspicious at all it was

590
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,760
communicate it actually doesn't

591
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,690
in a browser that's quite a lot of
embedded links that you can see here

592
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:38,150
in the first instance the first time it
was uploaded

593
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:42,880
nothing malicious the Denon weary scanty
a few months later we

594
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,460
or a few weeks the three basically saw
think this is a bit strange

595
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,150
a lot of this link links contain malware
so the whole smaller

596
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:54,640
and then we can blacklist that sample so
it even happens that's

597
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,730
someplace created by malware writers it

598
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,960
registers the means for command the
controls and the only activate it

599
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,590
oneself

600
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:06,520
sufficient user base a.m. so then you
need this kind of technique to

601
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,970
two spots that be in this case res
scanned using the

602
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:13,940
Google saved also API tough to identify
thats

603
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,320
I'm up and over to

604
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:23,470
not just with a slight alright little
bit of the

605
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:27,150
conclusions so I think Andrew still

606
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:31,160
the platform of choice right on what we
see is is a high increase in

607
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,420
in our samples that come to us a

608
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,700
we see an increase in in the number of
findings different milder

609
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,440
different Packers its is very
interesting so it's it's really on the

610
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,349
rise and especially what we focus on is
Andrew the banking malware and and you

611
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:47,180
see love interesting examples there

612
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,829
on one thing I would like to say is is

613
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:54,500
we view this as a research project so we
give everything

614
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,150
for free on our website so you can
really if you want to try this out go to

615
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,829
our website

616
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:02,329
upload your sample and and we gonna go
through it and you gonna give you back

617
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,180
to results so

618
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,790
you have full axis to do that to all the
data

619
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:10,790
we also even if you think that we miss
certain things in our analysis police

620
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,819
let us know if you're not one of the bad
guys and

621
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:18,960
a few slides on future work so what are
we working on what we discussed

622
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,380
this religious a behavior analysis in
the

623
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,329
a the userspace right so in you file is
created

624
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:30,109
in the userspace at the permission model
is it used to be detected

625
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:33,290
but in case that we have an exploit that
we don't know yet

626
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:36,569
that is affecting a physical device what
do we do

627
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:40,780
well we can take a snapshot of the
memory weekend them that we can

628
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,510
inspect certain permissions sorry
certain

629
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:48,280
partitions on that on that drive and we
can then compare that with the base

630
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:48,849
image

631
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:51,980
to take a starts the that we know that's
clean

632
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:55,150
take a disk image from Google for
example let me start

633
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,920
comparing at the bit level this is
really interesting to

634
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,609
22 spot newark new exploits he's tried
it historically on

635
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:06,299
all the versions with known explodes
this works only for least

636
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:10,349
the if you have the tools the chem sweet
that's a available online

637
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:13,569
we're also trying to

638
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:17,119
do a better guess at the militias is a
publication

639
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,150
it's quite difficult to do this to this
site

640
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,260
currently we have three categories CF
good to hear

641
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,609
suspicious or known militia samples

642
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:30,760
what we doing this groff is basically
trying to

643
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,680
I'm really the sample true maybe twenty
or thirty order analysis techniques

644
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
decide hours

645
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,240
be done going to constricts an
intelligent 3

646
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,609
very can make it better

647
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:46,119
more intelligent guess on the
maliciousness so it's perfectly possible

648
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:46,759
that's

649
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:52,390
one of the analyzers that only uses the
permission model to identify my over

650
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,650
is saying look it looks good refuse
another scanner

651
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,869
it might see I'm we're also doing this
deep inspection on the operating system

652
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:03,220
maybe citric reconsider and then we

653
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,769
I'm have a decision in the middle and
see look it suspicious

654
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:10,009
currently we cannot do this yet but
thats work in progress with the

655
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:14,460
University of Kent and also the physical
for analysis

656
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,999
this is just something that we we
finished

657
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:21,130
a a first proof of concept on a larger
does bets

658
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,420
last month this is research from just 43

659
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,799
from last year black shirt we got the
inspiration there

660
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:32,009
to really run the analysis on lots of
mobile phones

661
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:36,160
and it's also something that we are
considering if anyone wants offenders

662
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,749
through

663
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:39,950
alt phones feel free to add to talk to
sister

664
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:45,249
presentation and I think you're
perfectly fine within or slots

665
00:38:45,249 --> 00:38:49,049
me before few questions were thanks a
lot for a for joining

666
00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:57,790
and open to any questions thanks

667
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,730
profession

668
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:03,290
ship

669
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:09,869
so a offers only your recommend your
mother or young boys to to use an end to

670
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:10,230
it

671
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,640
that's essentially the question on the
defense for what I would say

672
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,710
a yeah it's the Pens are they going to
do

673
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,940
yet if if you stick to the

674
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,119
to official release is above the Rome so
for example the Google phones

675
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:28,230
if you stick to the official stores I
think you're quite fine be just see that

676
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,890
a lot of people go beyond that the
router phone

677
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,900
that's just more convenient to do and I
on Android rather than on a US and in

678
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,410
Europe more exposed

679
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:39,970
a but does a lot of her colleagues use
Android I use

680
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:44,359
mean a US but if you used it that's when
responsibly that's fine

681
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:48,359
at think just think current ecosystem of
and route still gives more opportunity

682
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:49,359
to

683
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,760
to expose a device ok for example the

684
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,030
a rooted phone the becomes quite a bit
more vulnerable of course

685
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,660
that's a bit more clothes I think when I
US also historically there's less

686
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,210
smaller samples anti-u_s_

687
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,410
a schism yeah close in on the

688
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:09,940
that are known was so that's probably
for a TD in Syria

689
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:21,450
cocaine this

690
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:24,680
the question is is is our is ours
project open source

691
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,090
and the front end s not open source lol
something that's not political tributes

692
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,000
a very stupid

693
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,070
uproot area have where you can put in
samples

694
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:37,010
the interesting part if you want to
collaborate the the freemen to create

695
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:37,740
workers

696
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,850
so to pull in a sample to analyze it and
to

697
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:44,240
come back with results that's something
that we can the

698
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,290
its it's not open source

699
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,810
weekend separate it's really just sit
yep in

700
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:54,600
Russo deftly talk to us if you're if you
if you want to contribute to it to

701
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,690
approach XO

702
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,440
what we want to do is we want to give
everything that we scan for free back to

703
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,220
the community

704
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,680
but with the way we work there's there's
of course a little bit off of work that

705
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,960
we spend in there in there so might be
in there so

706
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,330
that that's not open source we want to
prevent also

707
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:14,390
now they're said writers from creating a
worker submitting their results and the

708
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:17,990
basically poisoning the the database but
the contracts

709
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,190
to interact with the the API's just a
restful

710
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:26,000
a RESTful API thats thats fully
documented so feel free to doctors a

711
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,700
me too yet thanks ok any other questions

712
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,730
right yet thanks looks good like yeah
