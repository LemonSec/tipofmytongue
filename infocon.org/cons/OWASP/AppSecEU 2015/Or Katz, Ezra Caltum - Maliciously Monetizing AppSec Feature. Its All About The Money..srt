1
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,820
sir

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,470
okay

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,870
and think we have everybody so next up
are

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,060
or in Ezra from Comite who are here to
tell us

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,320
the universal truths that its all about
say

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,810
the money at the end of the talk small
reminder

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,360
if you think they're really that well
give them a green card

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,610
if you think this talk was a waste of
your time

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,770
sneak in a red card so they don't see it

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,590
and with that I'd like to give them the

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,150
the state is there's thank you I'm

12
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,050
so again my name is or

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,840
and with me as well both of us all wrote
working at taco night

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,320
and today we're going to talk about
malicious

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,860
monetizing out the creatures and wealth

16
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,470
it's probably obvious to most the view
and we'll talk about it

17
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,570
in our presentation it's all about the
money money makes

18
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,450
other motivation and we will show that
so

19
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,570
well what's up with the story I L
presentation

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,860
and the story started when the red phone
was ranking

21
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,659
and when the road phone is ringing we
are getting very excited about it

22
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:26,900
so this is how we look when we get
excited but

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,720
we can look much more excited if you
want to okay

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,530
and move if we should show you that
later so

25
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,270
Ste bottle that bad the finger at me

26
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,280
now were doing is that we gotta thank
all

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,610
from all over our customer telling us
that there is some issue in his

28
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,790
obligation and when we get the call and
we get into the data would look

29
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,630
into they can try to realize what really
happened there and

30
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,610
in many cases when we do that we start
from bottom to top

31
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,260
we look at that very basic unit if they
die in our cases

32
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,020
HTTP requests and once we look at that
request

33
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,200
we're able to steal that this is them
request going to 2.2 update call

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,739
it's not action in the name of the
application obviously we masback and I

35
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,000
guess it's not one is

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,360
we're going to the link page with Obama
to name your

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,490
I'll anything that bombing that we can
see how

38
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,440
the reigning solo act and always been
against yep

39
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,040
response does go 302 coming from the
server

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,890
so we proper out a similar request

41
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,350
to that application try to minute backed

42
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,190
request and bingo we got on redirect
request

43
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,310
and this is how we look we r when we are
very excited

44
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,620
and well that's the beginning a bet and
in order to talk about

45
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,870
what we have seen with what we have just
saw which is an opening a direct

46
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,780
portability

47
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,930
let's explain a bit about open redirect
I'm sure most of you are familiar with

48
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,290
that

49
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,660
but let's not but by talking about it so
according to match me

50
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,470
and opener direct porn ability you when
someone is redirected from the

51
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,230
application

52
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,230
to a different place whether it's
external link external page

53
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:19,600
or whether it's in five application so
how it is being used maliciously

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,010
Val according to a stop and it can be
used in our to install now worse

55
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,040
it can be used in order to do i bypass
of

56
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,700
access control and that usually in
internal link

57
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,140
and can also be using in order to
explore the passport

58
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,170
by or is he doing a phishing attack or
stuff like that

59
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,450
and the stability and imperative that
low according to all stop them

60
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,970
we choose number them the rest the
impact you moderate inexplicable Eugene

61
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,060
is average and according to military Eva

62
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,950
the idea but expect is low to medium
well

63
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,070
it may make wonder about it because

64
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,400
it seems like them big in back to back

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,910
this open redirect born abilities you
can read your review

66
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,130
and the right thinking about it and
trying to realize what's that up

67
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,280
was the reason for that wipe doesn't
happen I think the answer for that is

68
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,690
that

69
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,940
I think the samples that I am hearing
most like my career

70
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,459
at by developers best thing well it's
not about

71
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,610
it's a feature it's a feature regarding
from one place

72
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,870
tonight afflict this is how they do

73
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,540
this picture well how does

74
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,040
open a direct looks like in a phishing
attack first step

75
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,310
a malicious guy semi neel weekend our
link to face with outcome which is

76
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,000
good application application that I
trust and one fine brass thing that link

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,479
I'm being redirected friend Facebook
about calm

78
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,169
to Facebook got caught which is
obviously a malicious application

79
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:56,500
s only of course it's an example but
Facebook has

80
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,370
have been ability in Palmetto main URL
redirecting me

81
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,260
the fake Da Capo well this is what
happens

82
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,690
I'm actually now in from Fig think we've
got going

83
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,300
most likely they will get back on the
new posting it to Facebook about call

84
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,490
and then they will try to maybe still my
passport or

85
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,500
any other condition credentials so it
before moving forward I would like to

86
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,410
spend one minute

87
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,440
talking about the system that we are ok
walking up you know the true

88
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,020
explain how we get the day about how we
tell the story but I'm about to tell

89
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,510
and I'll talk about acolyte a content
delivery network

90
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,039
I am brendor backed have Intelligent
Platforms

91
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,669
about acolyte well we have been mr Swan
Island offended this there is around the

92
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:42,169
world

93
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:47,450
may be sick many cities many countries I
love beta goth rock on my system which

94
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,340
is interesting

95
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,260
but i wanna important part is that
between 15 to 30 percent

96
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,960
on the Internet traffic growth rock a
mic our stories based on that data

97
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,550
this is what we're going to talk about
the data that goes Bruno thirst

98
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,610
still we started with a single a stupid
quest

99
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,440
going to application and we saw this
request is abusing

100
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,150
most likely abusing open about
portability now I'm want to move forward

101
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,900
and do

102
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,570
more %uh intelligence on that night
after the first that but we were trying

103
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,490
to do work

104
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,370
let's try to look at I attackers
activity so we have an IP address the

105
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,400
fans militia traffic to an obligation so
would try to

106
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,820
what you are welcome

107
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,730
let it rock going from back to back from
that IP address

108
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:50,990
through the application to the portable
application route

109
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,800
is a going ok sorry for that

110
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,220
so again one attacker

111
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,240
to the bottom of page on a time frame
with 24 hours

112
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,430
we were able to see that that the
Packers redirecting traffic

113
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,250
do more to 1700 different domains

114
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,800
different publications the second step
of our analysis well

115
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,030
let's try to stay if they are

116
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,300
other attackers and that the publication
of backing the application backing back

117
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,620
veritable page and what's the common
thing about their the packard the better

118
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,690
during excessive access to that burn a
bowl

119
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:35,039
I'm page and surprisingly were able to
give them more than 1,000 IP addresses

120
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,470
with are performing both kinda excessive
axis

121
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,639
through the portable page on that
application I think that the

122
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,080
this point we understood that we have
something here who want to be to look

123
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,949
further into that

124
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,919
so just do like see it graphically what
we have seen so far

125
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,590
where one thousand AP is we have one
opening day Cup occasion but if

126
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,690
but were unable to open redirect and
there are more than seventeen hundred

127
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,349
domains that are redirecting to

128
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:04,419
step number free

129
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:08,440
nooope we know that we have one thousand
IP addresses that they're doing stopping

130
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,130
militias

131
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,590
now we want to look at across on my part
for

132
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,970
make it better be the gross to letter
that

133
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,729
I can I customer tried to figure out if
they're youth something happened there

134
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:23,680
and surprisingly were able to see

135
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,630
with the old IP addresses abuse more
than 4,000

136
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:33,229
run a publication to open redirect and
redirecting to madame

137
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,270
them following different domains that
brings us to

138
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,450
and diving new scale again graphically

139
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,100
1000 IP's now we have for 1000 open like
portability

140
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,600
going to more than 10 K domains step
number four

141
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,990
now we have big story we do I love the
to

142
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,070
and would like to do nope up till now
we're doing zoom out

143
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,460
now we want to do is

144
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,140
remain into the data and rip look into
that and see if the

145
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,790
pumping I've there is a common enemy No
gonna denominator in that beta

146
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,510
and the something that was calling to

147
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,010
all there's one thousand I got this is
but send the fax

148
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,810
was the user-agent have a value actual

149
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,900
body was the fair across overs one
occupied with

150
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,819
and work that led us to believe that

151
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,300
roselawn IP addresses are actually want
doctor abusing

152
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:36,450
many IPS across the internet and this is
how it looks graphically

153
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,140
we actually have a single distributor
backer abusing

154
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,360
many iPad others so

155
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,920
week reach out to their final step in
our mouths it which is that number fight

156
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,290
now we have the day that we have this
story and why do some security that

157
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,420
intelligence on that

158
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,280
the first thing well we have one ramp we
have

159
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,130
than 1000 remains and we looked at those
remains and we can see these are

160
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,350
legitimate publication

161
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,820
they are not fishing application they
are not installing memory from

162
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,150
go to those application their legitimate
applications meringue publication by

163
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,590
but legitimate ones more than that

164
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,960
looking all those 1000 IBM's as we can
see that forty percent of them

165
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,340
actually proxies and opened in approx
looking at

166
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,250
there four thousand more noble ops and
we can see among them

167
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,500
well application with our for Bowl

168
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,750
well vendor that are in Fortune 1000
companies

169
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,900
meaning big these are not comfortable
giving some neglect the pic

170
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,650
as small and medium business kind of a
Picatinny lower very large companies

171
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,280
and that led us to believe that what we
can see here

172
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,300
is a when we can see an activity that is
part of

173
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,140
search engine optimization about and we
thought we'll talk about that

174
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,900
so how does that fact loop

175
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,140
graphically well up till now we talked
about

176
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,770
well Evo will explain but with we've
talked about

177
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,920
I'm the activity that's good

178
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,600
as the espada bet that is doing the
maintenance of that doctor

179
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,270
attackers trying to make sure all those

180
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,350
openly direct wanna be's are still
active

181
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,190
we can go through them to all those
obligations and this is what he's doing

182
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,770
babe using those boxes

183
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,510
but the scale back is much more is much
bigger

184
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,780
the first Apple that back is that doctor
its

185
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,190
putting O'Connell spam across the
internet including those wonderful

186
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,530
obligation redirecting to different
publication and the second step of that

187
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,090
back is that he's using corn

188
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,260
the main thing is that we sell so far
and trying to make sure that goes

189
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,780
well those links and those operate
directs us to act

190
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,280
the second part of the slope

191
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,320
campaign comes from the search engine
optimizations

192
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,890
with growth or the spam servers press
those links

193
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,140
reach early press those links go to that

194
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,010
a voted obligation but has high rank

195
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,580
there's a good reputation and from Vera
being redirected

196
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,850
from those well 10k domains that we saw
before

197
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,060
bring back overtime will improve the
ranking

198
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,050
of those domains and roll when we think
about it what's that mean

199
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,970
motivation of Bath back the motivation
is obvious

200
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:36,690
its money it's all about the money so
what have we seen so far in our story

201
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,080
folks think well

202
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,650
open direct is not only been used for
fishing

203
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,360
and and installing metal is it can also
be used to

204
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,880
SEO attacks another thing that

205
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,930
we kept over inside that can only be
achieved when you are having

206
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,850
arrived vision alive

207
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,050
room and a little beat up and that well

208
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,980
and probably strep intelligence tools
can give you an item

209
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,100
well I don't tools to do those kind of
is it to get those count all the insects

210
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,579
which is important another thing that we
can see well

211
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:18,290
when money is involved when money is
your objectives

212
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,319
when you read driven by money this game
is over

213
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:26,790
back usually go height and we also need
to do

214
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,100
both for finance the first line is we
have to know how to

215
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,160
how to detect and how to defend against
such attacks

216
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,540
and we need to know another thing we
need to be on da stop them

217
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,009
we need to look beyond the trivial thing
on well they're not read a book

218
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:46,120
the important things that aren't up then
went two up 2 p.m. to think that our

219
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,389
be on both them them their fingers in
the list

220
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:52,759
now you have them speaking to over

221
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,889
so I'm going to

222
00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:01,060
so I'm going to continue speaking about

223
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,279
I'll some of technicals how to actually

224
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:08,699
Dec this in Europe particular platforms
without the need to do

225
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:12,389
date or anything just few small data
analytic some

226
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:18,860
love based detection and I'm going to
start with at typical axes locks that

227
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,899
you probably know about that you have
probably seen and

228
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,899
in the skill he doesn't give us a lot of
information tools because it's

229
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:29,790
too much data so I'm going to give you a
couple of

230
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,430
whole advice to be able to identify this
particular thank you sir

231
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:40,170
so the first thing that we want to
recommend you use to identify

232
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:45,220
all the places we do accept external URL
parameters and replication

233
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,110
are if you prefer on our secure
development life cycle program before

234
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,139
you probably know

235
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,680
know it but not all the places no

236
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,610
where where are the prime it's our site
you accept this are

237
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,910
using tax stock and doing simple regex

238
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,519
could go at very good to to find

239
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:09,920
the spurt parameters you can just go and
play quit the amount of characters that

240
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,100
you want to find

241
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,350
or are before the character that you're
looking for instead of 0 to 10 you can

242
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,070
go 0-2

243
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,610
20 or whatever on from there start par
un

244
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,640
where is Sal your love two words it will
be

245
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,610
issue in simple just identified the
Prometheus and pretty the table

246
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,280
and see that you will have something
like Lincoln URL where you will see

247
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,540
URL parameters but you will also see a

248
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,540
the amount help or whatever other
promises were you don't have I'll

249
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,750
domains so I'm going to give you a

250
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,330
a little bit display mode this table is
misleading you'll see a lot of

251
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,780
small number seen a a mountain health
because probably scanners are trying to

252
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,110
do

253
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,050
r fi or whatever but not on the same
scales

254
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,700
that the places where we kept actual
domains an actual parameters

255
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,730
of to ours

256
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,580
try to identify what are the usual links
where do you

257
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,220
where do you are actually thinking to
are you linking

258
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,910
inside your industry are going to your
website where are you saying your users

259
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,430
to

260
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,780
and this can also be

261
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,970
it dawned with the with the output of
the previews

262
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,110
regex and just use our unique see and
count

263
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:31,940
the amount of the mains and we'll see is
something like these will see like

264
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,920
your domain but calm which should topic
number which could be

265
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,930
related probably twenty internal attempt
to

266
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,320
internal linking or an internal attempt
to out indication bypass like my

267
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,930
colleague or

268
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,430
was talking about and we will probably
will see

269
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,780
this trench domains that we were that we
were seeing can't small amounts

270
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,910
does some things that the attackers were
you seen for the maintenance

271
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,040
of they are network office you'll and

272
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,480
they are simple to talk and Atticus its

273
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,870
its not the usual stuff but you should
be linking to

274
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,129
for

275
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:14,289
I another indicator of compromise and
this one

276
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:17,939
is quite simple we had seen it a lot in
the wild

277
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,399
its an actual very old exploit

278
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:25,479
in the PHP in full form chum which it
was discovered by

279
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:29,220
stiffness or something like two thousand
five or six I don't remember

280
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,190
and he she just found out that

281
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,609
if we arguing serialisation with the a
promise ring the

282
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:40,239
in for PHP the contents will be

283
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:44,309
are will be wrong outside of their
html-link: older

284
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:48,759
so it's an actual X exorcists and the

285
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,479
they are using it to to puts in there
all

286
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:56,690
each team on injection which will follow
by the crawlers

287
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,450
up i doing great in PHP

288
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,869
and the a popping close

289
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:08,190
you will find this so particular with
directions

290
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,159
where we can see that they just try to
do a train to fund the domain that they

291
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:12,899
want to

292
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:16,099
Inc to improve the the score up

293
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:20,179
its very simple exercise that you can
try to run interlocks and you will

294
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:21,379
probably find this

295
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:25,979
a lot so

296
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:29,340
just to summarize we the Certus

297
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,759
treat techniques to identify there's
first a template-based signature to that

298
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,009
fight which promise there's

299
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:39,419
we are using the second is to order by
axes domains that the for diesel simple

300
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,720
indicator of compromise

301
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,009
just to detect if somebody sexually
abusing this

302
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:47,009
so

303
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:50,229
now that we know how to detect if these

304
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:54,259
actually happen let's try to do
defensive coding

305
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,349
to prevent this kind of abilities so

306
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:01,039
the first step is doughnut allow open
for their acts

307
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,940
are if you but if you must

308
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,999
are let's follow that advice from OS

309
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:11,679
so and the West page we

310
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,269
its script in the air force already
registered for school trip H

311
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:18,929
not the find yourselves that they're
going off your site and have them click

312
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:19,919
a link to confirm

313
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,340
which

314
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,720
sadly as we have proven here this
technique is being

315
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,070
use for the SEO so this is not there

316
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,120
advised that we would recommend and its

317
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,210
instead of that tried doing again if you

318
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,610
must have an open with you a call for a
quite this approach which domains you

319
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,540
want to approve

320
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,890
and everything that it's not in the
white least just

321
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,270
dont approve it up we know that

322
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,730
a lot of business owners will come back
and tell us know but

323
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,740
we need to be able to resurrect where
every single domain we cannot

324
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,140
manage not I'll a whitelist approach so

325
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,890
the second at a piece of advice that we
can provide in this scenario

326
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,070
and to to defend about this particular
attack

327
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,050
just do disable open the access to the
Roberts

328
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,630
if the attack is sick cancer crawler
that its

329
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,450
actually harvest those things for
political purposes

330
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,990
let's just make it harder for them but

331
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,650
by disabling we'd robots.txt the
crawling this page 1

332
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,040
follow links and also but you you seen

333
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,220
HTML make the tax to explicitly disable

334
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,350
the follow links: part EDS in this
particular

335
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:39,880
West Beach up

336
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,140
also a dollar good that by sis if

337
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,370
you must have if you cannot have the
white lease approach and will

338
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,280
ready at the detection of the a disabled

339
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,470
crawling and Roberts are just say the
least

340
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,300
of the resurrected domains having gussa
having it thus a good development

341
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,020
practice

342
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,110
somebody review them and in

343
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,320
certainly now blacklist again this is
not the first approach

344
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,100
is not what they would like to recommend
you but I know business owners and

345
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,860
business owners could be some things

346
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,210
very pushy about this kind of stuff and

347
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,800
next an obvious one is ensure that there
are no exorcist march demanding

348
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,330
Jackson's your website

349
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:24,020
as we've seen previously the previous
light in the personal slights

350
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,180
they are using the HTML injections not
as a Nexus S

351
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:33,200
but rather a cell not a sec at a
technique for executing JavaScript

352
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,510
but rather a static

353
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,540
for including links that will be
followed by search engines and will be

354
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,170
used to improve their

355
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,350
ranking on the particular website that
they want to do that

356
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,830
so

357
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:52,060
if we manage to to after we finished
talking about this particular scenario I

358
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,130
want to talk about

359
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,660
three other techniques we also recommend
you going

360
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,270
beyond the West then up these techniques

361
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,070
art not necessarilly are dissidents

362
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,760
if you're already managed to go troll

363
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,820
OS security issues congratulations work
at dawn

364
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,060
what nobody else has been able to but
nevertheless let's sell

365
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:21,890
let's also talk about the essence so the
Starbucks were scraping

366
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,340
and before it was startled with
spreading it would like to read that the

367
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:26,980
finish on

368
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,030
its are with harvesting

369
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,730
or with extraction is a common suffer
technique for extracting information

370
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,010
from web sites

371
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,460
this means it's a computer tool this

372
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,200
that its interacting with your website
to extract

373
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,710
information that could be used for many
different reasons like

374
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,080
for example scraping all your price
lists

375
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,620
storing them in a database and I suspect
your competitors

376
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,840
and just bring which is a cheaper price
or

377
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,910
just affecting fourth your

378
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,050
business to which the day cheaper
product and

379
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:07,660
they will probably be able to affect the
revenue for company

380
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,710
so day are hurt this applications
feature for financial reasons

381
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,360
and help us it looks

382
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,610
actually it's basically a web scraper
that goes through their

383
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:25,610
get Catholic page and starts playing for
example with Dad number Prometheus and

384
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,130
going

385
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:31,070
through them to get the copy of Turin
tarp few entire catalog and stringing

386
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:35,210
on their website this a very common
practices with see in the lot

387
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,970
how much with that senate so

388
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,900
basically

389
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,930
we analyze it 24 hours state on all

390
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,090
the I comix platform data which is
something like

391
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,620
85 de Leon requests on the day

392
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,010
out of its

393
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:00,300
9.4 our butts 9.4 percent for parts

394
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,730
we are talking about 8 de Leon requests

395
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:10,580
that are being performed by computers
which are cutting prices this

396
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,080
up 24 percent we were unable to
categorize we're still doing

397
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,950
research we are still identifying what
does that mean

398
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,320
6 percent are API

399
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,050
engines which are probably stuff that
you in the first place

400
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,270
do decide to be accessed by scraping on
by

401
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,680
normal computer success in computers
that's why there are

402
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:38,170
on ATI 26 percent are the search engines
inciting the exercise you're probably

403
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,680
looking forward to seeing

404
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,380
your website at the end those are the
ones that are treating you business and

405
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,440
is sartre was a

406
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,120
bringing do customers 1 percent

407
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,340
our security scanners worth talking
about

408
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,540
stalls that goes to your website search
for one abilities

409
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,320
and probably it could be a service that
you paid for it could be a militia

410
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,970
stockard that it's trying to

411
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:07,930
identify vulnerabilities and 42 percent
are does scroller spader since croppers

412
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,070
scrapers that we talked about previously
that could be

413
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:15,500
affecting your business I still
information by still injured

414
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,670
your the information that could be used
but

415
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:22,340
up by other by their web pages portals
just do

416
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,400
find the lowest prices from products and

417
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,800
not a lot businesses like them so

418
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,030
they in they try to apply certain
measures

419
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:38,260
to be able to block them but as we speak
previously

420
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,430
this is some money driven attack and
when that extra money three min

421
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:46,960
we are talking about a different scale
for example a very common practice

422
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,200
is to try to set to JavaScript

423
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,809
at I java-based jobs

424
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:57,429
JavaScript based challenge which should
be all these sold by browsers that

425
00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:01,119
support JavaScript arts what doctors

426
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,669
are starting to use headless browsers
debate detection

427
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:07,809
we are talking about on them JS and
skate p

428
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:11,230
and many many different browsers that

429
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:16,049
chance of those JavaScript challenges
making it's much harder to detect them

430
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:16,789
unblock them

431
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:21,509
art they are also using practice and
botnets

432
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:25,360
two of you skate the dainty tend to load
balancer traffic

433
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,440
we are seeing that instead of doing

434
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,710
1000 request to get order catalogue from
a single IP

435
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,659
they are doing temp requests around 100
different eyepiece

436
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:43,159
and its ass as they are doing it's slow
and

437
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:50,049
under the radar it's much harder to
identify them and bush

438
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:53,899
which has also seen some very
interesting and very cool stuff that

439
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:58,080
basically Dr scripting entire particles
they're going through old

440
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,549
their thing I sharla or two they all
tiller to all the trouble

441
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:06,269
or whatever to try to find the the Los
price and you could probably

442
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:10,389
read about it and have found this group
on the internet that us

443
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:14,029
ascend users are useful but as business
the art the business

444
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:18,749
a lot up

445
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:22,960
to solutions swelled there are lots of
solutions are a lot of techniques to

446
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,289
to to block about scripting attacks it
could be

447
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:30,740
implementing captures for rate
controlling

448
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,610
the amount to fight these or just start
many different solutions to enforce

449
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:42,240
the next the next point that we also
want to talk that it saw

450
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,619
its its it's not in the actual lowest
than

451
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:49,379
it's something that we like to call it
shady resurrection which

452
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:53,090
is actually if ninth fishing attacked

453
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,129
where the objective is not to

454
00:27:56,129 --> 00:28:01,749
still credentials and also the objective
is not to do SEO cure the objective

455
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:03,520
is true ready wrecked

456
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,070
there and you sir to a fake products
shop

457
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,600
and they are using by inter mediate
remains to be

458
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,530
much harder to track them the
interesting sheer

459
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,890
here the interesting thing here is that
they are combining

460
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,680
are stored XSS and common spamming and

461
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,090
they're doing something very innovative
let's

462
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:29,620
talked about it they are taking
techniques from the marketing Walt

463
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,700
to do commercial trucking they are

464
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,560
actually use in jobs creates to more to
get

465
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,630
hold the fuq leaked and work if she came
from

466
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:43,620
and which the mice are still active
unaltered information that it's useful

467
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,660
for marketers

468
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,930
will peace guys these criminals are

469
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:52,740
also marketers an are also using this
information in a problem statistical wat

470
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,140
and it with something like these for ZTE

471
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:02,310
attacker will huge extort texas' into a
vulnerable domain

472
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,540
are and he also creates

473
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,660
I'll website called fake that com which
sells

474
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,070
what a perfect products and then he
starts doing

475
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:18,210
comments spanning at the comment
spamming

476
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:22,140
it's being accessed by the by dense you
sir and makes us

477
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,650
much harder to actually tend to fight
which is fake but calm

478
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,130
the red erectus not been performed
directly to fake that come

479
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,910
but rather go into on start Texas is
subject to maintain

480
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,450
in the middle and not only that in this
store Texas is our souls

481
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,830
this commercial trucking that such want
reporting here

482
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,730
all kinds of interesting information
from the use likes this regiment

483
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:49,020
on his wrist fairer and which pages he
clicked from this enables

484
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,660
the attacked first but taft of which
domains are still for now all

485
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,950
where are they coming from and if the
compy sexually

486
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:00,270
Bengal

487
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:04,299
up debt by series as we talked
previously

488
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:08,850
I'll try to make it harder for the did
money-driven attackers to do things like

489
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,410
try to keep your domain three of Texas's
an HTML

490
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,750
try to do moderation on the can comments
that you're getting into you

491
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,500
West Beach is for technics the testing
recommend it for a long time

492
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,559
%uh the third think that we want

493
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,270
talk about would be us something that
you've had seen

494
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,650
probably a lot and you could probably
sure than actually to a song

495
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,070
this morning's keynote which is the
deals ransom

496
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,330
which is something like this

497
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,620
have adidas army ready to attack your
website

498
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,120
you either pay just three hundred
dollars indeed const place

499
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,200
in 24 hours alright with pressure
website again

500
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,190
again good day so

501
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,240
at this point you have two options

502
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,790
you all do not day and they are going to
try to adidas you

503
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:03,460
and

504
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,740
you or you pay and you become a bit too
for life

505
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,640
basically think protection on for money

506
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,020
through the entire career like mopping
criminals

507
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,030
like the old classical Cream Ale Walt

508
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:21,870
up what can we do against it

509
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:25,850
is just too identify which are the most
expensive applications

510
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,600
application parts in our website like
for example if we know that there is a

511
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,790
particular web pages

512
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:34,030
does transactions to that to base on

513
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:37,820
it could be abuses sure that we do rate
controlling cannot insure

514
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,320
I'm not allowed more than X requests
before

515
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,049
to spring to catch our doing something
that could be harder to do

516
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:48,110
to automatically to to

517
00:31:48,110 --> 00:32:00,169
details at West Beach so

518
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:01,609
so deep

519
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:04,979
it's what I summarize what we have seen
so far so the first step is an

520
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:09,129
something that we saw all I on the
entire presentation that

521
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:13,080
well we believe that the greatest
motivation for hackers is money

522
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,950
and its all about the money on

523
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,009
we saw that and when the attackers
checked in this month driving

524
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:24,399
date with the tax scale and it will be
much harder to identify

525
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,419
ass argues resource s targets more

526
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:31,009
are more and points on

527
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:35,519
it's much harder well we can't we were
able to see that

528
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,249
well background using and not attacking
the cake such as they wrap

529
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:43,450
and the opportunity direct burn ability
and abusing 18 not to do

530
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:50,229
new kind of attack which which is the
Xbox and we also see that no

531
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:53,779
drive not known attacks are being free
frappe guys like

532
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:56,859
old excess exploding

533
00:32:56,859 --> 00:33:00,590
use for SEO or the are the de Dulce

534
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:06,809
being compared to net ransom tool to get
month and the final thing that we would

535
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:07,669
like to say that

536
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:11,259
there is a call for action we will be
live with their they lost the thing is a

537
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:12,479
great document doing

538
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:16,440
a great job for all of us but I think
that we should look

539
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,570
further beyond well-stocked and try to
to mitigate all the things that are

540
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,779
out there and the thing that are driving
our organization and

541
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,979
take money out of our organization metal

542
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:31,260
thank you

543
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,320
its

544
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,840
I'm if you yet so I think thank you very
much for a freeze talk

545
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,110
and showing us that pain but band he's
not the only way you can lose money from

546
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:44,550
pacs

547
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,540
that actually getting hacked this worst
and forty audience

548
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,660
if you like to talk please remember to
drop a green card

549
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,150
in there if you don't like the top don't
let them see you talk a red card in and

550
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,950
they have a serious platform to toss you

551
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:02,130
up should not set up if you think it's
was okay or so so

552
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,770
don't drop a card and Hannigan brute
double Grynch article

553
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:09,310
I so

554
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,800
I if you have any questions that so any
questions

555
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:21,690
sorry especially regards to

556
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:25,120
the web scraping case what what and

557
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,440
ki just give any detail any the the
mitigation CEC working

558
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,659
if you only date on that from the bottom
for

559
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:37,550
so

560
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,940
up on I'll our acid

561
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,950
I'm the

562
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:47,870
there is no doubt about it that's
related it's a competition against that

563
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,070
occurred at its not easy

564
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:53,280
and in any case we feel that winning the
competition is not right

565
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,800
if you will if you're actions to block
scrapers

566
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,840
then I think that you are making
mistakes

567
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,660
because once you block them they will
find another route 3 obligation I think

568
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,160
did

569
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,960
our job is to make better job much more

570
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,740
harder make their the scraping a lot
much much more

571
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:17,410
a slower and by doing that by taking
them

572
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,710
into the level that they have to raise
the level of bears the first occasion

573
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:25,150
and they mount a big dick big retreat
from plication will be buried

574
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,280
low that will give us the ability to you
know

575
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,760
to to be in the balance where'd that
bear attack is not affect

576
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,350
that bats I think the good and third
given that

577
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:38,590
the best sign up

578
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:43,550
thank you

579
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:42,550
%ah
