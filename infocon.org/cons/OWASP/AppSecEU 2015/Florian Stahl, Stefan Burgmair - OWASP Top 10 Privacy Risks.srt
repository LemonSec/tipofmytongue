1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,950
hello and will come two-hour session
about the OWASP top 10 private service

2
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,130
project s

3
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,460
already set my name is to reinstall I am

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,700
I found it the project together with
Stefan

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,220
I in the beginning of last year actually
i

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,270
year for the pro take a nap two years
ago at the Absecon abscissa and not an

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,710
accident in Hamburg of course

8
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,280
I at that time we were justs

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,710
thinking about I'm okay we have lost top
10 project for classical

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,950
vulnerabilities security vulnerabilities
in web applications but there's

11
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,140
nothing similar or comparable for
privacy risks oh and

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,270
then we started to look if there's any
guidance on that but be detected this

13
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,640
there's no real guidance on that and we
started and that's actually when it

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,460
decided to found this project

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,979
so um Stefan wrote his master thesis
last year about the project and

16
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,090
I'm now we're both working for MSG
systems which is on the

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,390
IT software consulting company a based
in Munich Germany

18
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,350
and today a we gonna tell you a little
bit more about this pro checked first

19
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,929
about the background and the goal is to
approach a

20
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:24,119
but then also the method used to derive

21
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,880
this top 10 risk list and then of course
the results and

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,140
probably even more important the cult
the measures a

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,369
for these risks that we detected and in
the end

24
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:37,479
we gonna give you a summary so

25
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,090
since we're at a security conference on
my first 12

26
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,390
spent a just once lied about what
privacy is about

27
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,190
on so privacy interests are related to
personal data so this is basically data

28
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,660
about you about me saw that every person
it could be named address phone number

29
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,619
email address

30
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:01,440
but of course also location data IP
addresses

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,450
at basically everything that is
connected to the

32
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,869
to an individual person so prices not

33
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:12,340
only about security security of course
is a important enable for privacy

34
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,980
privacy is also about a limitation of
collection

35
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,489
so that not all data is collected a
chance to

36
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:21,740
decent amount of data is collected

37
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,410
it's also about data quality that
integrity is

38
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,940
a data is in together and data is also
correct

39
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,010
am it's about specification of the
purpose

40
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:38,160
so that I date is only used for the
purpose that it was intended for

41
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,200
and not all not also for many other
purposes

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,590
this is also in connection to use
limitation so that it's only

43
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:51,240
used for a limited a for some limited
things for some limited purposes

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,170
and one of the most important things is
transparency so that the people's

45
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,459
that their data is used should know

46
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,000
i'm for what a the data issues actually

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,120
at their a pair of that the data center
third party that analytic system on the

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,170
state that saw

49
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,540
and connect connected to that it's also
about

50
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,140
individual a participation so that you
as an individual can choose what this

51
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,290
time to data

52
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,850
and then you can opt in op out that you
can tell the provider when your data

53
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,200
should be deleted

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,120
or on analyzing which analysts should be
done and saw

55
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,380
to bed basically these this items that
you can see here is from the

56
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,980
are from the OECD privacy guidelines so
kind of

57
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,959
independent framework and that's also
our definition

58
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,390
offer privacy risk that is a violation
of these

59
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,180
guidelines so

60
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,590
let me just a explain a little bit the
situation in the private sector

61
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,590
from a simplify perspective that we
currently have i mean they're up

62
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,310
privacy laws all over the world
basically every country has its own law

63
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,160
there's an you directive

64
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,070
I am you with and Germany for example we
even have

65
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,060
a.m. law different laws in different
parts

66
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,939
same in the US so on challenges for sure

67
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,250
that but application yeah

68
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,120
for some sectors I think or sick toria
loss at least I mean

69
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,979
its its quite difficult landscape I
think so

70
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:31,440
on and looking at globally use that
application of course this is a

71
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,150
challenge

72
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,710
which law does apply for Wat and it's
not really

73
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,050
I I mean there should be a global
standards and what to you is currently

74
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,880
working on his

75
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,750
channel at data protection regulation
that at least

76
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,800
a makes a common law for

77
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,479
European citizen data but it still for
several years already under discussion

78
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,580
so then bf

79
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,009
a secret service is an essay and so on
that under my privacy without real

80
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:03,970
just a bit cation and control and I mean
this could also be about discrimination

81
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,020
there was

82
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,320
a lot of discussion about a what
happened in Fergus and in the US for

83
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,289
example that

84
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:14,389
black people may be discriminated we
don't know if this happens also

85
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,330
I secret services for example when I
went to the US last time

86
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,919
I had to go to us through a secondary
security screening so

87
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,090
somehow it seems that I ended up on some
watch list maybe it was just

88
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,729
I was just pick by random but maybe also
security and privacy consultants that

89
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:34,180
do not work for the NSA or secret
services are already on some kind

90
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,750
watch list so I mean thats a

91
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,270
yet difficult situation in my eyes and
of course we have lost

92
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,580
for example the current you direct if
this

93
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,220
twenty years old they don't address real
privacy risks

94
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,050
that we have today a globalized Internet
cloud computing and so on

95
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,770
so this is for sure also a

96
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,270
challenging being and we have to safe
harbor agreement

97
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,169
that a what a date state to transfer
from US to the

98
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,550
European Union that is not really
trusted by

99
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,460
many

100
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,400
people and you anymore it's a lot of
paperwork but we're not sure if it

101
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,900
really

102
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,330
on improves privacy and then

103
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,240
and probably most important for us
technicians and

104
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,500
people that want to make replication
more secure a more privacy friendlier

105
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:26,949
technique

106
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,990
solutions that often do not

107
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,610
provide sufficient privacy transparency
so in the end

108
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,130
a we should forget about loss they're
not really

109
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,750
a.m. enable us for privacy replication

110
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,310
what we want to do with this project we
want real privacy

111
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,970
replications so on because currently

112
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,090
many privacy at least at many Web
applications still

113
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,310
contained privacy risks but on the other
hand they are compliant to lost because

114
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,820
maybe there and hosted in countries that
have poor privacy laws

115
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,370
or maybe the main focus is just in
compliance just on the check mark from

116
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,520
the department

117
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,610
but not focusing on the real life risks
so as a set

118
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,699
I we decided last year to founders of
top 10 privacy respect

119
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,099
project because there are no existing
guidelines a statistical data about

120
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:21,320
privacy risks and application I mean

121
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,870
loss of course there's the privacy by
the sign

122
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,349
concept that bilby or will probably be
part of that

123
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:33,930
new you regulation but there's nothing
more in detail it describes how to

124
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,680
implement

125
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,699
produce place I so that the project so
far was quite a success

126
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:42,789
we had nearly 100 privacy and security
experts

127
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,599
that participated and the project itself

128
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:51,849
at the goal to identify the most I'm
morton technical and organisational

129
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:55,820
privacy risk for a better education so
it's not enough

130
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,020
to focus just on the technical issues
privacy also has to consider

131
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,110
organizational issues to really work and
you wanted to make it independent from

132
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,449
this patchwork of

133
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:10,520
global loss and each country so we
decided to base it on the

134
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,539
always the Privacy Principles and to
focus on real life

135
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:18,039
risks on for users on the one hand but
also for the provider

136
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,180
that of course could have a

137
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,889
rotational financial risk if they have
for privacy

138
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,060
place the ultimate

139
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,410
ultimate goal is to help a developers
but also

140
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,659
business architecture legal departments
basically everyone that helps in

141
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,640
deciding

142
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,150
a web applications of ok decides about
functionality of weapons the cation to

143
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,909
understand privacy better

144
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:45,420
and also to provide transparency about
priceless

145
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,190
what is not in scope is a actually this
self protection for users

146
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,140
I'm so if you want to protect yourself
to install some client tools

147
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,690
some plugins that somehow or a avoid
storing cookies or whatever

148
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,600
I make make your computer more pricey
friendlier or

149
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,800
privacy your browser more pricey
friendly that is not in scope because

150
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,120
be say on there's so many users out
there

151
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,610
probably be at some clue about how we
could do that but there are so many uses

152
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,230
about

153
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,960
out that they they don't want to care
about privacy they don't have to tie a

154
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,360
knot

155
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,779
to care about privacy they just expect
that some solutions our Privacy friendly

156
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:25,120
so

157
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,000
that's why the focus on the operator
that they make their ratification

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,209
more pricey friend so what

159
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,880
did you do in the projector how to be a
a get this

160
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,120
a top ten list in the end of course we
had to create a model in the beginning

161
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,470
a.m. we actually mainly

162
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,080
our model was based on a privacy impact
assessment that

163
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,550
a was created by the German Federal

164
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,200
a.m. Office for information security the
yes I

165
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,860
and on the other hand we had the always
be Privacy Principles

166
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,660
I'm then we had to identify potential
violations

167
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,800
what is actually quite similar to this
threats in the security world but

168
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,170
the we didn't a we thought the

169
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,690
term threat didn't really fit year
because actually

170
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,370
when we have such a retro violation it's
already a violation against the Privacy

171
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,720
Principles so that's why

172
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,740
we chose the term of violations I

173
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,790
then we did a classic to risk a.m.

174
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:33,149
risk assessment actually be a rated the
impact of the violations and

175
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,589
a at a look at the frequency of currency

176
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:40,279
for currents and we multiplied both of
them and had

177
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,500
became a rated list of privacy so what
we're currently doing is

178
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,450
rolling help to measures and best
practices so anyone of you still

179
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,149
interested in participating so you can
have a look at our website

180
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:56,779
that's actually a the status where we
are at the moment

181
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:59,930
so what we do

182
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,870
did to identify a actually in the end it
was twenty

183
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,110
potential privacy violations for this
top 10 list

184
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,630
I'm we had a look at the interactions
between the replication so we had a look

185
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,130
at

186
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,020
how it doesn't interact with that party
applications with the operator with

187
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,950
authorities

188
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,300
potential attackers and uses so in the
end

189
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,930
you get twenty a.m. why relations there
or on a like a medium

190
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,810
aggregate level not too deeply technical
not too high level

191
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,709
so it wasn't kind of compromise that we
had to make not to get too many

192
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:40,000
and not to miss anything

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,950
and we were at had actually a look at
the

194
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,040
at the frequency of occurrence and

195
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,860
India and the beginning of course we try
it to find some statistical data how

196
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,269
often do certain

197
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:54,589
do certain violations occurred in
practice

198
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,769
but we found out it's it's quite hard or
its nearly impossible to get data from

199
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:01,940
companies a statistical data about how
for example

200
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,600
how on personal data is deleted or

201
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,170
if personal data is sent to third
parties without the use this concept and

202
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:10,959
stuff like that

203
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,709
and that's why we decided okay it makes
most sense to ask

204
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:18,839
experts that really deal with these
issues and

205
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,029
on a daily basis and we asked 63 privacy
and security experts

206
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:27,950
I am to rate how often these

207
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,100
violations that be identified current
practice we have one example here of

208
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,149
sharing of data with third party and

209
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:39,459
we asked them that it happened like
between

210
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:44,260
0 to 25 per cent to one another up to
one out of four replications up to every

211
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,940
second revocation or

212
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,810
up to three out of four that vacations
and so on and you can see here

213
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,910
most people thought tips between 50

214
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,770
75 percent and also some more than 75
percent

215
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,790
so we helped that in the end with it or

216
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,720
we Khan wanted that to a scale from one
to three and it was an average of one

217
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,089
point

218
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:09,279
eight-year and then of course we also
need it the impact for

219
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,480
on for this violation and

220
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,700
we did that following I'm we hate

221
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,100
40 percent a a look at the application

222
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,329
operator perspective on the impact on
reputation and brand value and the

223
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:24,300
financial loss

224
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,029
there and sixty percent at the date the
subject perspective social standing and

225
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:32,360
reputation financial well-being and
personal freedom

226
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,890
and pills a day to professional judgment
here and discussed anguished

227
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,579
experts and rated each of these

228
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:44,889
with the way you between one and three
and got an average

229
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:47,639
to hear and we did that for all

230
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,339
20 violations and in the end we've got

231
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:54,370
this list of top 10 privacy risks

232
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,360
I just gonna give you a brief Osun

233
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,009
Stefan will tell you the more about a

234
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:06,060
those that are bolt here at the first
risk actually

235
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,300
a replication wonder ability so this is
basically what that the old the

236
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,880
classical over us top 10

237
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,440
approaching addresses so this is also
was also considered the biggest privacy

238
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,949
risk

239
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:20,300
for applications second one was

240
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,850
operate it cited data leakage
Stephenville tell you a little bit more

241
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,660
about that

242
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,490
in a minute I then there's the
insufficient data

243
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,029
great response so missus basically about

244
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:36,259
a.m. I think we heard that and some
other talks today

245
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:40,389
and that you always should be prepared
that something happens because like in

246
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:41,079
traffic

247
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:44,449
even though if you have good driving
assistance systems there will always be

248
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:45,470
accident so

249
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,459
and that's the same for privacy and
security breaches of course

250
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:52,560
on even if you have quite good

251
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,160
a privacy in place that will be
preachers and you should be prepared

252
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,490
on the one hand to inform the persons
that have been effected maybe they have

253
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,100
to lock their credit card or change the
past but

254
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,100
so he should inform them also the media
possibly

255
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,750
and of course you have to a you have to
renegotiate the

256
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,329
problem the real cost that the same
thing doesn't happen again maybe

257
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:19,779
disconnect the cable and yah patched
assist them

258
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:22,939
I mean just taking the the corresponding
countermeasures

259
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:28,630
the false risk is insufficient deletion
of personal data so this is about

260
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:33,740
a that personal data it's not the needed
although maybe not anti amo not on

261
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,500
request

262
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,829
weiss's a is that such a big risk
because

263
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:41,230
on if data is deleted it's not there
anymore and then

264
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,720
if data is not there anymore there's no
risk to the state of course 0

265
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,329
this is part of limited limiting the
collection of data and

266
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:53,319
that you delete it when it's not need it
for that purpose

267
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,570
you collected

268
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,570
the fifth risk are a non-transparent
policies terms and conditions

269
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:05,140
the six risk collection of data that is
not required for the primary purpose

270
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,960
for example if you make a purchase on
the internet and

271
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,050
you collect location data or you collect

272
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,860
other data that is not really ready
required for this purpose I'll

273
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,150
what is actually quite common at the
moment and often of transfected

274
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,260
the seventh risk is sharing of data with
third parties

275
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,110
the eights risk is outdated personal
data so

276
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,840
data that this basically not correct
that could

277
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,240
that match your reputation because it's
false information that is spread about

278
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,770
you

279
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,420
maybe you get a pat credit rating
because status

280
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,910
not correct and saw nice risk is missing
or insufficient session expiration

281
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,490
and the tense risk is its about in
secure data transfers a

282
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,530
it's basically about non encrypt it
transfer

283
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,990
place personal data that I think Jim
medical was talking a lot about HTTPS

284
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,500
this morning so that is also basically
what this

285
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,520
a risk is about so now stuck on electro
a little bit more into detail for some

286
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,070
risks

287
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,570
and okay

288
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:17,360
thank you for all your own in I will
tell you something about the

289
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,439
about the potent risks

290
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,459
and before that I will tell you
something about

291
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,990
the Constanza project them

292
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,550
we've identify those risks and rated
moderating for it

293
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,600
and know we're

294
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,660
in collecting countermeasures the

295
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,700
as friends before there is no real a.m.

296
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,870
address for you can go to if you want to
address problems wrists

297
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,070
and the main purpose of this project is

298
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,640
tooth to be such a platform to give
information to people

299
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,640
and I will not tell you voters lists or

300
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,900
and what we've collected to know or not
everything but

301
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,860
partly okay the first one I want to
introduce jus

302
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,580
the second hits them it's the

303
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,880
operational over it is a data leakage

304
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,539
and sisters information is leaching
through the

305
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:16,610
operates organizations through its own
stuff and procedures

306
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,820
and the problems that cause

307
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,200
this process you or on

308
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,860
of course proper access management or
missing its management

309
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,799
the the is a Juve unnecessary copies of
personal data

310
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,929
the what can be done the concert is

311
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:37,980
you can implement the X Management the

312
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,280
you can use data leakage prevention
solutions

313
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,730
in implementing data retention or
deletion management

314
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,100
can be useful the of course

315
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,640
the on stuff is already threatened by
its

316
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,760
engineering a text who want to steal
personal data out of the

317
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,980
& Company we can use

318
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,030
wins campaigns or establish security
protocols were

319
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,210
your stuff can stick on the for a while

320
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,490
how to handle sensitive information on
how to give it

321
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,690
further am

322
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,190
another problem related to this risk is

323
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,030
the organization's personal data and
it's very commonly used for

324
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,360
because its als the operates
organization

325
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,120
to avoid privacy laws conceive the

326
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,299
analyzed it it's a

327
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,669
it's not personal it anymore and you can

328
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:40,489
technically to whatever for whatever you
can use it for whatever purpose

329
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:44,389
you want to them it's useful

330
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:47,789
publications research in internal to the
organization

331
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:50,999
home the problem here is

332
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:54,929
a new specific circumstances the
musician can be reached

333
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:57,989
one example for this is

334
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:02,190
the Netflix price on

335
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,720
Netflix once released the home

336
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,190
the ratings of the custom us looking

337
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,549
and the was deleted the user names

338
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:16,700
the customs and they wanted people to
trying

339
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,850
to improve the the

340
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,700
rating system Netflix for giving you
hints for which

341
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,929
you for which phones you want to see you
next

342
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:31,179
and for those purposes the those

343
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:36,639
most it has been published and the study
from

344
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:39,669
from the texan University showed it was

345
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:42,879
pretty easy to compare those states a so

346
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,350
ratings from the Internet Movie Database
will

347
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,090
names are publicly lip will so they
could show

348
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,700
the who was rating at Netflix and

349
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,639
besides the ratings the wanted to
publish through the Internet Movie

350
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:58,330
Database

351
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,460
were able to show what the because they
were

352
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,749
the rating South

353
00:21:04,749 --> 00:21:08,710
so from course

354
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,409
though different kinds from position you
can

355
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:17,139
it you can delete state you can most
states you can

356
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:21,600
generalized 8 them randomization

357
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,519
you can to several stuff and things to
try to minimize it

358
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,710
but its the pretty easy to

359
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,850
compare those tater them giving them

360
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,470
should take some attributes the

361
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,739
of the state's compare it with another
table where we have

362
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:42,780
names you can

363
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,460
we identify the people study the

364
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,670
the another study showed that

365
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,710
you can identify most US citizens

366
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,430
citizens but just supposed the changing
the date of birth

367
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,410
which is a big problem for medical
research you often

368
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,300
really is exactly the stator for doing
statistics

369
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,670
home yes set

370
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:13,710
another the second because the second
disc I want to introduce it to is the

371
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,910
non-transparent poses in terms and
conditions

372
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,710
it's pretty comfy

373
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,740
everybody knows the have you reached

374
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,160
those our Terms and Conditions and do
you agree with that

375
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,330
yes of course it no we didn't on people

376
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,200
just click and wants to get the

377
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,350
opportunities to use website the other
issues

378
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,890
the reasons why they are not read or
issues with the

379
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,220
terms and conditions are they are not up
to date inaccurate

380
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,660
incomplete hard to find their way too
long and

381
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,850
basically they do not support the
russians decision-making

382
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:57,580
in and to

383
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,630
the the

384
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,120
the reason why they are it so bad is not

385
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,400
really minutes for being written by the
users though

386
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,850
just the leading insurance

387
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,360
the hosting company so

388
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,150
what can be done against us and

389
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,210
adjustable is a point of to find the
principal it policies

390
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:25,330
the for the in and nothing

391
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,880
that is quite hopeful with an example
from

392
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,900
500px total the price you

393
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,190
the policies yes the

394
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,540
owns small explanation of what

395
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,130
the the terms and conditions telling you
and

396
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,230
left inside you see long description
both

397
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,390
what state is collected by the website
and

398
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,180
I guess in the back from the back of the

399
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,580
is just great its long texts and

400
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,280
but on the right inside you can see what
it basically is

401
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,960
they collect your your registration and
user profile data

402
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,100
and they collect the look information to
website

403
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,250
support on this

404
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,390
pretty much explains what they do and on
the left hand side you can see the

405
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,850
full definition what they're doing
exactly

406
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,490
if you want to on

407
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:25,580
in case you update your terms and
conditions

408
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,680
you should keep track both which use the
case constant which

409
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,280
version its functionalities

410
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,390
is changing the website is changing

411
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,710
the purposes of changing and if you

412
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,700
wants to further improve the the website
shoots

413
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,420
keep track which use a case to common
sense to

414
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,690
to do with the state to what and

415
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,270
of course we should make your

416
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,550
terms and conditions with languages the
content is in

417
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,010
you just-released people in Germany

418
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,120
you it is enough to releases and John
but if you have

419
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,340
a broader set the

420
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,370
concerns you should me the mill

421
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,400
respective languages and

422
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,680
another good example of we sold

423
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,470
balls the from Kaspersky and

424
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,550
the provided transparency about this

425
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,130
parties this table confined the webpage

426
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,290
the the lesson site is

427
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,440
the solution you can see

428
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,580
you can they give it a category for what
its used

429
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,440
the the name of the company rights

430
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,570
the address of the company the Privacy
Policy Officer party

431
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,900
and additions with that the providing of
a fucking if the third party is giving

432
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,290
you that

433
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:54,230
from some many times as you can lookouts
lemme

434
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,690
you can opt out through a cookie them
setting

435
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,990
and they provide even the spot seems to
be:

436
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,130
we though way to

437
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,850
the show your what's happening on your
web site to users

438
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,900
and it's usually done talking about

439
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:17,130
for parties the next was going to
introduce the two

440
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,930
is the sharing of states with party and

441
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:25,630
sites how to inform users it is
important to

442
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,890
and to Knotts ru review two million data

443
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,210
to other people 22 those parties the

444
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,560
supporters are photos opens a
subcontractor's

445
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,570
which whose which its Lititz

446
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,720
with you liberation absolutamente
central is implemented into a website

447
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,670
the problem is that is transferred or
sold

448
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,870
without the knowledge other users the
didn't give consent that they don't know

449
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,580
what happens

450
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,450
this is such complete loss of control
this picture made

451
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,970
is made from some light beam and

452
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,990
to see or couples bubbles

453
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,770
the first part is if the city's such
places as

454
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,810
trying is all the related third parties
and you

455
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,850
presidency just really visitors 23 side

456
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,809
she was eating and connected with that

457
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:24,690
or 207 third party sites its

458
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:30,070
pretty hot stew keep trickles who gets
information about what use

459
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,549
just seeing them in such and big network

460
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:39,890
you visit more than 23 Saturday self
defense

461
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,830
its pretty easy to use add-ons like a
light beam goes three

462
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,549
no script the but little project is
asking

463
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:51,820
what can an application to work and the
operator to

464
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,160
to improve its will for civil

465
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,270
third-party services should not be used
to default it's not required

466
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,600
sunscreen quite obvious but

467
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,600
you can use that conditions

468
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,640
can use content conditions the

469
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,840
one example for this is Sharif shows
matured

470
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,900
once the its script which

471
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,169
you can implement into a website the
basic problem is

472
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:19,809
the

473
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:24,299
those social that the buttons Facebook
Google+ Twitter

474
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:27,669
et cetera and that

475
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:30,690
that people can contribute or or comment

476
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,769
your content but sensei

477
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:37,399
every time somebody is visiting your
website the

478
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:41,409
purses sects causes is good yours

479
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:45,070
appears is still transferred to

480
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,710
those third-party providers them

481
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,850
arrest does it actually is

482
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,919
you can visits to replace those buttons

483
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,940
another solution on there is still can

484
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,010
and share or

485
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,620
or link applause the clintons but

486
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,960
the the it is not transferred without

487
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,429
as long as you don't wants to contribute

488
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:15,529
the that means most uses just visiting
the websites

489
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:21,730
not tracked and nothing that can be used

490
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:27,010
is the third-party monitoring strategy

491
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:31,070
and you can make a pit releases

492
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,299
whether he wants to and gifts specific

493
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:37,419
companies specific solutions access to
Web site

494
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:40,620
but what listing existing and

495
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,960
should trick what are the cats are
arrangements with those companies

496
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,260
potato the collecting what all the using
the state 24

497
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,779
and what the purpose but they do like
we've just seen

498
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:55,960
before from the cops spassky website and

499
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,000
as a heads to puts and company or

500
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,370
solution a witness's cause a few call
your

501
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:08,340
users complain about it or issue reading
newspapers something about it you can't

502
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,019
just

503
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:16,240
put it on latest and lockers for usage

504
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,690
the last thing I want to just two sons

505
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,830
insufficient session expiration and

506
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,890
many companies to restrict the use
behavior as long as possible

507
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,559
though pre-sales social network search
engines

508
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,890
engine engines and workshops were
showing this behavior

509
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,919
the busy the or

510
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,950
the using cookie which is tracking the
user behavior which

511
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,110
doesn't expire really is just for
looking

512
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,630
what uses looking at you what

513
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,820
which and problem is

514
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,830
again the use is not aware about the
collection they don't really recognize

515
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,220
that they'll still looked in the

516
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,139
may be still trapped and in of course it
isn't over

517
00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:04,850
my trees security shoes as well the

518
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,919
what can be done losses

519
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,049
of course the you can use

520
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:14,769
reasonable session timeouts and

521
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:18,730
you can make the local talking highly
was little

522
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,090
years and not the solution which is
provided

523
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,389
by that the John you look for a while

524
00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:28,539
that's looking like that few

525
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:32,039
the use it didn't lookout office the

526
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:35,639
the session them the next time he's
looking on

527
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:38,990
is getting this message which explains

528
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:42,570
while ok what is important them how to
look out

529
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,279
with local partners said that he should
do the next time

530
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,730
own on the right hand side

531
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,779
you see a picture which shows the which
can

532
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:56,720
this also Facebook them it shows on
which devices

533
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,769
the your laughlin with no concessions to
Facebook

534
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:05,360
because the don't respond as well or

535
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,970
to Creek okay

536
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,299
normal give you a short summary of it

537
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:16,529
the prizes the issue in

538
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:20,600
a little publications should be improved
and there is

539
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,080
notes too much awareness about those
issues two-mile the biggest issue we

540
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,590
found is

541
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,330
the tourism absolutely no practical
guidance

542
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:33,070
and how to avoid them we just tried to
silence

543
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,139
the solutions from other sites the

544
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:39,929
see some of them Sharif is one of its
more good ideas

545
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:43,429
from other web sites like this pesky or
with the its

546
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:47,179
the just a collection what we do and we
try to

547
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:50,380
give people for its disorders
informations

548
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,980
and give people a guidance on how to
improve its case

549
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,049
they wanted to of course them

550
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:01,070
well we

551
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,500
tried to be real real about the
mission's but they are

552
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,399
will technical solutions they are more
organizational

553
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,279
solutions the only thing that is very
important it's

554
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:15,389
is not doesn't stick to the to the local
laws to

555
00:33:15,389 --> 00:33:19,000
some rules at all because as around
mentioned before

556
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,130
the rules are too complicated it's too

557
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:26,370
to on secure to to to really find

558
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,159
a baseline for this that's pretty much
its

559
00:33:30,159 --> 00:34:00,970
thank you very much for your attention

560
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,220
I think you need of course unit lost

561
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,679
up sorry and because it criticizes loss
in the beginning so

562
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,829
and the question was or you thought that
that's necessary

563
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:17,589
laws are necessary anyway to push people
and force privacy

564
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,790
and yes I think it is definitely
necessary

565
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,510
I think the point that we wanted to make
is that there's

566
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,609
currently not sufficiency addressing the

567
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:31,919
worldwide privacy problem that we have
in a globalized internet

568
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,780
an but still the an important factor in
that I think

569
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,599
I think it's important that E

570
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,790
you regulation this this coming quite
soon and saw

571
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,750
but I think it's not the only factor
that will help us because

572
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,149
loss accompanist will always tried to

573
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:55,200
have pushed laws or interpret the laws
in a way that they have to take privacy

574
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,920
not too much into consideration I mean
the

575
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,700
we already see that what Facebook Inc
who is doing that trying i mean

576
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,880
and aced going one step towards again

577
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,730
if the if they gets you by the European
Union or something

578
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,470
I at it's an important factor but still
we have

579
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:16,670
I think they're its good to have
something independent from loss as well

580
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,540
some kind of best practice like the
classical over stopped and I mean it's

581
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,690
not either based on

582
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:25,760
loss even though there are computer
security laws or

583
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,609
information security laws also around
the world so I think it's good to have

584
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:30,280
something in

585
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:44,430
and that's for sure combination

586
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,220
over month Prime probably help us all
civil organisations

587
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,200
the there is the so-called Big Brother
Ward

588
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:57,119
as an example with the awards some
negative award for companies and

589
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:57,990
organizations

590
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,320
who the to privacy

591
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,349
the the

592
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:08,859
or worry pros who owns and if the
companies rated

593
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:12,410
on this the start keeping to start
getting interest

594
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,790
in improving the privacy and company

595
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:20,160
you will to Ford then more likely than

596
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,310
usually do but its

597
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,470
its it's a fight of course and I think
what

598
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,720
what else might help this i mean would
you also see now

599
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,840
that some companies that

600
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:38,140
are on people say about them that their
don't take privacy

601
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,090
too much into account of course some
uses least two companies or some

602
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:46,730
companies try to reduce other product
mean day they also get some commercial

603
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,400
pressures

604
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,650
well but we don't see that on a scale
yet that

605
00:36:50,650 --> 00:37:00,720
they the behavior really changes
otherwise we still have some few flyers

606
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,220
about the project here

607
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,240
a she wants to take otherwise

608
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:21,210
the Flyers available on the project
website as well

609
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,670
up

610
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:33,349
up

611
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:41,510
city P in Brussels a I was that to a ok

612
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,020
I mean

613
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,500
definitely it's it's a it's a hard fight
if you want to call it like that I mean

614
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:49,950
the

615
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,280
maybe even that more difficult than sick

616
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,500
security I but on the other hand we also
get a lot of quite positive feedback

617
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,210
about are pro check from people working
in this area

618
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:07,500
the data protection authorities that the
commanded as a best practice some people

619
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,799
say that okay be

620
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:12,390
started to implement that of course on a
large scale we r

621
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:17,380
kind of I don't know I don't want to
call it lost but I mean of course we had

622
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,910
difficult situation when you have a look
at privacy because

623
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:27,819
I think the bald guy I mean it gets
really complex you know and

624
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:31,460
nobody really has transparency and most
people and i think thats

625
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,799
pic issue because many people don't care
too much about privacy because they

626
00:38:35,799 --> 00:38:37,280
don't really know what happens

627
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,970
so on the other end of course it's a
luxury problem as well

628
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,680
if you have a look at people that maybe
have a hard time
