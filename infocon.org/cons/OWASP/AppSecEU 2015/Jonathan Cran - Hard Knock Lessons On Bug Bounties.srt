1
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,030
main mas to keep keep it on your bottom
line

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,469
I'm not running away from you

3
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:20,380
okay guys and my own but come back to
their tracks

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,770
and come to this he's a track frank and
I A R

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,910
my name is Tobias we gonna be your host
today here the Seas attack

6
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,950
and it's a great pleasure for me to i
mean

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,570
introduce you to Johnson crammed and

8
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,570
if she's gonna be talking about back
bounties and I think it's quite amazing

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,129
when i read your area

10
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,690
abstract analyzing 30,000 submissions
are you must have gone crazy

11
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,320
and I was always wondering like yes a
lot of money in backbone.js I mean

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,999
should have maybe change profession and
to that instead

13
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:57,499
who knows maybe after today we'll know
more

14
00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:01,480
so without further ado I will not come
to you

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,340
Jonathan thank you thanks way

16
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,580
I forgot lasting I later when you leave
the room

17
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,700
if you really love this give a green
card if you're thinking well there was

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,050
snow not so great

19
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,630
you can get a red card study that and a
few undecided just walk out of the door

20
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,960
and everything's fine thank you Corp
thanks guys

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,540
thank you they don't hit that

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,990
good get in a wreck them awesome they
took over the top

23
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,039
I really appreciate everybody I know
staff people filtering in here so

24
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:34,890
despondency

25
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,910
and make yourself at home say what we
talked about today

26
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,060
by badass I my name is Jonathan grant I
we

27
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,600
have I am you know some a lot of things
to talk about a lot today to go through

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,820
and some lessons they get this till
about that so we'll just jump right into

29
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,140
it

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,140
I'm this talk I actually started at
Derby Conn

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,020
in the USA last year and that's been
significantly adjusted sense then

32
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,450
I mean we've been sorta playing with the
order of things and so I show you some

33
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,500
data a prime

34
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,990
and I'm gonna died in this summer's last
dance. and so quick

35
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,380
you know to background on with my and
background

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,200
I I can I State University I'm in the
States

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,410
and you know with a background in system
administration

38
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,430
active science and some software
development

39
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,910
joined rapid7 as a penetration tester
and work with the Metasploit team for a

40
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,560
little while

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,709
doing the commercial products and then
also working on Q&A

42
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,140
I for that the whole the Metasploit
remark

43
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,180
I'm tortured by express guys below us
whether

44
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,250
pretty strong network background I'm in
some application as well

45
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,910
and now with bike route and what to do
about crowd I'm his work with the

46
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,940
analyst team

47
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,879
I work with customers work with
researchers and really just get

48
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,660
information flowing through the platform

49
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,040
and validate submissions that sort of
thing I'm

50
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,239
so actually missing a few letters that
have gone missing out here but

51
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,480
as everybody heard about it anybody here
that doesn't know about yes

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,580
known to self-select into that okay cool

53
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,530
I'm sure you guys now and the growing in
number and size

54
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,879
and the latest example I'm crew saw the
United Airlines

55
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,400
but Downey

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,620
yeah has anyone tested on the United
Airlines by Benny

57
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,110
got one in the back tip 3

58
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,510
four weeks outage

59
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm okay call but with the what's good
about that is that we're seeing an

60
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,370
uptick

61
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,580
and other industries are saying Western
Union started by Brownian fine at

62
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,960
United Airlines in the transportation
industry which is cool

63
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,120
I it's good to see this happening
outside a pic the regular tak

64
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,130
companies in a lot of tech companies
that use a pair microsoft adobe

65
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,910
I ya crew those sorts of things on saudi
researchers we have in RM

66
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,800
pretty good group researchers

67
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,270
how many program honors which is what we
call folks who

68
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,970
actually on a program I have cited above
any programs we have a couple people

69
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,520
how many people were interested in
starting about me that

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,230
got it okay I

71
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,630
so I hope this you know we're primarily
aiming at folks whose have started about

72
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,180
Bonnie

73
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,980
and but I think it'll be entertaining
and enlightening for both groups

74
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,109
I'm so let's get into it so

75
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:22,630
across the bike ride dataset we've
looked at 765

76
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,610
high and critical priority submissions
over the course of two years

77
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,560
I that out of thirty thousand
submissions and so

78
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,630
that is I'm it yeah

79
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,510
high in critical are varying and we're
getting to like what that means in a

80
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,130
little bit

81
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,430
but what I want to point out here is
that there's a lot of good submissions

82
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,740
coming to the platform

83
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,950
222 have those are critical issues
meaning

84
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,290
I'm xxc seek one jack shit and

85
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,780
up something when you get RC basically I

86
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,320
the average payout on a critical bug

87
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,240
is around a thousand dollars its ok I

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,750
I the highest in our dataset is 13,500

89
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,470
I was their highest payment ever I'm if
you break this down by program

90
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,960
there's around six

91
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,969
little over 6 higher critical severity
issues per program

92
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:19,409
and that's across all programs as a
hundred and fifty different programs

93
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:24,849
I 208 yes I 2000 888 paid submissions

94
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:29,789
400 in 81 unique: researchers pets
anybody event page from a bike rabbani

95
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:32,949
yet yet yet yet cool

96
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:37,039
awesome it's great to see that that's
really cool I'm

97
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,949
yet top it up 13:05 this is pretty dense

98
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:44,879
I'm but I just wanted to point out a
couple things the yellow line here

99
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,830
is the average amount per brownie and
the average priority is the blue

100
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,550
it so it's good if blue is low and
yellow is high

101
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,249
so that's actually a pretty awesome
banning right there I

102
00:05:57,249 --> 00:06:01,360
and you can see the average amount
ranges from you know around 200

103
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,169
I up to 800 across somebody's different
bodies

104
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:09,409
I'm is that what everybody expected I
mean is there any sort of

105
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:13,409
getting a couple knots cool

106
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:17,439
the goal here is kinda to show you
what's getting paid out

107
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,479
I and and sort of way that fits so

108
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,550
average payout per ballot issue I

109
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,710
I want to point out on a backup program
which is something we can share here the

110
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,659
average payout is 200 and we paid out a
111 submissions

111
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:34,469
and you can see how that works relative
to other programs on the platform

112
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:38,560
I'm to repay it out relatively high
number submissions

113
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,849
others haven't paid out as many I our
average amount is

114
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:44,939
me know pretty low compared to others

115
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,969
so she give you a sense of what's
actually getting paid out cool

116
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:53,779
I the Zacks a time box bodies same thing
here

117
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,909
average amount versus number of
submissions

118
00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:01,909
and so you can see I am you know these
actually a two-week program so they are

119
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:03,180
flights per day up to two weeks

120
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,620
at a time and and I'm

121
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,889
you get the idea anywhere from 100 to
500 on those

122
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:15,270
turns out that the average payout per
submission is about 200 bucks

123
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,270
across all the time programs to get

124
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,490
I'm across all

125
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,720
researchers so it

126
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,160
me say this again every researcher

127
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,480
has been paid on average twelve hundred
dollars

128
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,730
through our program and overall the
market

129
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,780
is growing so this you know give or take

130
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,960
around five million out there this is
just off the back in an Afghan based on

131
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,890
statistics for Facebook

132
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,460
Google and that sort of thing and it
basically means there's

133
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,030
45 to 64 time researchers at a hundred
thousand dollars a pop

134
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,560
the reason to share this state is
transparency

135
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,380
to the research community and really to
bring people to a point where they can

136
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,070
understand what actually getting paid
out

137
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,620
cell ready to start a bounty program

138
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,800
I the go

139
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,670
let you would like to say he is that
we've learned a lot starting Bugatti

140
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,710
programs we've

141
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,810
done over 150 of them and there's a lot
of lessons that have come out of those

142
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,390
I you know we've had people start their
own programs and come to bike route we

143
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,900
had

144
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,740
program start on the book %uh platform
I'm this really great lessons that come

145
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,560
out of each of these

146
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,120
so first things first have you run pup
sweet

147
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,500
on your application before you actually
bring it to about me we have people who

148
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,980
come to the platform and want to start a
bounty program

149
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,270
but literally every I

150
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,330
input on their application is wonderful
to see going to action

151
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,480
not a good reason to west at about it or
not a good

152
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,550
way to start a bounty program I it
doesn't necessarily apply to this

153
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,320
audience

154
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,270
but it's something worth stating you
know like about he isn't

155
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:04,150
a replacement for your application
security fundamentals area I'm

156
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,550
you're gonna wanna make friends with
your legal department what happens when

157
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,430
you approach bear family researcher

158
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,940
who wants you disclose bucks to you but
you don't have a program yet

159
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,280
can you talk to him

160
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,660
is extortion I mean

161
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,220
where is that line I we had a program

162
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,980
where actually i cost my came to us and
said hey

163
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,530
we've got a guy he'd like to disclose
some issues I

164
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,770
we don't have a program yet but we're
interested in entertaining it

165
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,780
and what we ended up doing was starting
a private program so that he could

166
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,390
summit

167
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,450
to the company and they could pay him
privately they didn't actually run a

168
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,610
public about a program at that point up
he wanted twenty five hundred euros per

169
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,130
issue and it was a financial site there
is excess ass and financial site

170
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,300
what they agreed to pay him seven
hundred fifty dollars and so they both

171
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,670
kinda walked away happy from that
there's a little bit negotiation

172
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,840
happened there I'm long story short and
i won

173
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,030
the end up starting Prada program
accepted some issues from not

174
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,440
and and the research I got paid and
everybody walked away to get

175
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,020
I what happens if a researcher discloses
about the fourth

176
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,610
before it's fixed how do you deal with
that you know what leverage do you have

177
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,340
in that case

178
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,700
something to think about something I
think and Tukey legal team about

179
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,230
I think it's over the reputational risk
of prosecuting researchers

180
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:31,110
I'm how many people have seen that chris
Roberts case I think there's quite a few

181
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,750
folks for those who are familiar

182
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,840
chris Roberts was disclosing issues in
United

183
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,040
and publicly on Twitter & and other

184
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:46,180
channels apparently I'm and United
Airlines basically went after him

185
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,560
I'm and you know he's in significant
legal trouble

186
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,860
they've been send started a buyback
program I

187
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,080
had there's a gray line there

188
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,030
amitai gray area and can see submit to
the buyback program now

189
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,340
is allowed to do that I'll

190
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,640
I'm what happens if former employee show
up and participate

191
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,630
we actually had an issue and not long
ago where a former employee came was

192
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,920
invited to a program participated

193
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,720
and participated in a and we found out
later

194
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,630
well that the customer themselves were
actually pretty upset about it

195
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:33,200
because the employees have been fired
and had some insider information

196
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,530
and you know what do you do in that case

197
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,010
should you accept issues from them do
you have a policy around it

198
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,350
something to think about I

199
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:50,510
this is interesting unauthorized access
or attempt to use ALTER destroyed

200
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,160
damaged data programs et cetera

201
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,710
this is on one of their systems and the
recently started about me

202
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,930
what takes precedence

203
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,520
should you listen to this

204
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,690
or should you listen to the terms about
something to think about

205
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,810
I'm ideally everything would be alive
and and if you had about me you wouldn't

206
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,930
see stuff like this

207
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,120
it doesn't have to be perfect but you
should provide a support channel for

208
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,890
questions

209
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:26,380
and if you are right about banning is
the development team on board

210
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,750
you're gonna have to work with them I

211
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,710
you need to be able to set expectations
with researchers and

212
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,750
you know work with them in order to
communicate

213
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,050
and get things fixed and you know
average fixed I'm

214
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,680
run somewhere between 30 and 120 days

215
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,500
is your dev team ready for that can you
communicate to them fast enough

216
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,940
have them fix it and get it back out I
thought about budgeting

217
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:02,370
I'm

218
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,400
if you fun too low if you start about me
with

219
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,460
with payouts that are too low you're
going to get more out of scope issues

220
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,950
an we see this pretty consistently I'm

221
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,140
there is a mobile band mobile bounty
that ran on the platform

222
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,980
with a twenty five hundred dollar prize
pool i mix missions do you think they

223
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,330
got

224
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,420
their

225
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,050
I with a gas emissions but there are a
lot of scope

226
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:31,510
nothing in the mobile know more about it
and in fact there was an ex XE

227
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,890
on a server should they pay for that

228
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,700
how many people would pay for that it's
out of scope it's a high-value bug

229
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:48,480
one just one

230
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,930
I it depends right

231
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:58,990
how do you handle osco issues

232
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,150
absolutely yet

233
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,670
yeah presently actually I

234
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,880
did this awhile ago they said you know
if we're going to make a change will go

235
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,710
ahead and pay it

236
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:15,240
and we see that a lot where I'm
companies have to make that decision

237
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,730
once there is even out a scope issue
that is legitimately a problem

238
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:34,060
and they wanna fix it I'm they did

239
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:40,550
they did speaking at the night by Bonnie
bans on customer facing web sites such

240
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,130
as

241
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:46,010
such as: what is such as Manhattan at

242
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,190
should that be they've got a man that's
you al dot com

243
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,140
should that be in scope it's not I mean
its customer isn't

244
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:01,910
is an everything on the internet
customer-facing really thank up to that

245
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,710
isn't Cup

246
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,110
I do you expect his company web
applications

247
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,610
what he credentials I'm

248
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,200
what versions this gets really tough
when you get the hardware

249
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,290
when you got different from our versions
I

250
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:24,260
there's about a run on a platform where
they built a custom firmware version

251
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,250
and put it on the hardware and shipped
it to researchers

252
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,380
and the researchers worked on it

253
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,870
and turns up that custom firmware
version was slightly at it

254
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,780
say that there is an Icee that was
reported

255
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,970
it was fixed in the latest version was
affixed to the person they were testing

256
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,690
and wasn't fixed

257
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,620
with a customer with the actual deployed
application

258
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,180
should they pay for how many people have
a4

259
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:01,550
yet this some gray areas that I think
they did end up paying for

260
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,610
they didn't they weren't really sure
they wanted to but it

261
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,180
they did eventually I'm

262
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,960
actually with the bug is kinda
interesting src

263
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,050
I'm p.m. UPnP which is kind of a big
deal

264
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,320
mine I'm to just come back to this

265
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,840
you know good cleared IOSCO Pierre this
this is actually

266
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,550
it's a good start I mean I'd love to see
start at United dot com

267
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,620
and other demands but the more explicit
you can get

268
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,940
the better am

269
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,150
bugs on the United up what's the United
up ways that

270
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,330
I assume it's a mobile app Anna

271
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:48,060
up

272
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,160
so so this this particular program is
open

273
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,960
and public this to really categories you
implement time box

274
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,280
I'm usually Thai boxer fix budget so you
really have like ten thousand dollars

275
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,790
that just

276
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,980
until it runs out then it closes down
I'm

277
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,230
or there's the ongoing programs the on
going to harder we are not a lot of data

278
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,710
that says I mean it's hard to know up
front how much you can spend we often

279
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,900
end up inviting companies to start while

280
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,540
and then work it up over time to start
it

281
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:28,400
5500 move up from nap

282
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,480
access you get by the researchers I'm a
lot of folks are coming to you

283
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,170
the platform wanting to disturb the
credentials to researchers

284
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,480
I saw shaken at

285
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,040
okay that a bad idea

286
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,250
why up

287
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:54,990
up

288
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,690
yet but maybe that such as our scope

289
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,290
maybe it doesn't need to be tested I'm
not

290
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:04,640
what happens when you give researchers
credentials

291
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,240
and administrative credentials and
they're all administrative credentials

292
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,370
here pandemonium pandemonium

293
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,670
I in and often not intentionally right
researchers generally a well-intentioned

294
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,780
and what you have is some be running a
up a scanner

295
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,880
walking out all the other apt helpful

296
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,370
what a pain I'm but you can't control
the applications provide a reset button

297
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,770
on a 24-hour Reza

298
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,170
and I basically let you you get to a
point where

299
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:43,060
every 24 hours you got a clean
environment yet the guy going to

300
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,220
distribute those credentials to

301
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,720
something about we are seeing more
people do this which i think is cool

302
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,580
I actually think it's a good thing I am
largely because not every app has a sign

303
00:18:52,580 --> 00:19:00,750
up

304
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,610
good question

305
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,710
I'm 50/50 so

306
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,590
that data we have says and we generally
it's

307
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,710
did try to talk to people and say you
can do this in production

308
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,990
or you can do it in stating staging
generally requires more work

309
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,020
if fun but you know that there's the
risk

310
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,900
reducing mechanism their having a
separate environment I

311
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,380
some folks run through a proxy before
they actually hit production or stating

312
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,799
make that's another way to do it

313
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,990
and I'm but yet fifty 50

314
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,390
on

315
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,900
some things to think about how are you
planning to reward swag

316
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,049
money points whatever whole fam

317
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,240
I'm if your gonna the US flag

318
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,169
we'll talk about it in a sack but think
about the fact that you have to ship

319
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:50,049
these around the world

320
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:54,150
I'm oftentimes people pay more in
postage than they do in actual fact

321
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:58,880
I get a fixed budget

322
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,370
how much yeah I mean I want you happily
you have to think about

323
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,510
I'm how much time to take you to respond
issues especially if you run over public

324
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,990
program sorta rule of thumb

325
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,990
stick a finger in the air fifty percent
other one you pay out

326
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,150
goes to pay outs are our site as much
money as you pay up

327
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,090
you have to pay that much in full-time
employees supporting it responding to

328
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:22,539
issues

329
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:27,810
where tho

330
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,990
I'm how quickly can you respond goes
back to that how long was it for weeks

331
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,650
for weeks for United pretty swell

332
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,840
I N is anybody think that's

333
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,670
okay good either

334
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:49,050
why

335
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:53,670
I why you get a big bump right here

336
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,660
you get a big bump right here by when
you actually released about

337
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,150
I get into that second but like you get
overwhelmed with issues pretty easily

338
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,090
I'm sure United married right now buried

339
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:09,170
I had an even clearer disclosure on your
brief

340
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,780
like do you actually allow disclosure
something about

341
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,060
I'm have to consider starting probably
I'm

342
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,670
lopsided color on the site up somebody
think about private

343
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,890
like I don't know that most folks know
this is an option these days

344
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,700
I'm it's definitely something to think
about you can open to a smaller

345
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,740
researchers

346
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,950
I'm make it fixed budget fix time if you
want I'm

347
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,080
you have because you're not open to the
internet you can actually have less

348
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,300
range in your skills and

349
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,850
and so therefore higher minimums like
basically the people you're getting a

350
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,510
qualified

351
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,800
I'm and it's good for getting started
enter

352
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,620
opening at over time the something to
think about I'm

353
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,360
is a public program up

354
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,710
they started about here I'm got about

355
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,260
eighty issues in the first day dropped
off over time are

356
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:10,080
in the first couple this what happened
here and we know

357
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,919
new release

358
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:16,440
pushy code article published on contract
site with it

359
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,710
one they get the money they yup

360
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:24,489
s they started with no reward and then
they paid for white sand dollars on the

361
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:24,950
bot

362
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,999
I and I think here's a news article

363
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:33,669
I'm some other thanks I think the double
there was right there

364
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:37,779
just for a short amount of time I think
but those

365
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:41,830
one guy with about an hour a day
responding to this

366
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,080
poor bastard I

367
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,719
we've actually I'm done a lot of work
with them

368
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:52,479
and eventually they just got to the
point where they clear through their

369
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:54,489
hands in the air and said you know what
we can't keep up

370
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:58,070
let's just eighty issues that we
validated thus far

371
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:02,659
and what starkly I'm it's pretty easy to
get over 12 the public program

372
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:06,710
I compared to a prior program

373
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,809
and I do want to point out the priority
here is is sort of

374
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:14,119
forest is a low priority issue a1 is a
high priority issue

375
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:17,559
and there's just such a wide range of
issues here

376
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:21,129
I with the with the proper and safe for
the difference the grass

377
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:24,749
submissions coming and validated
submissions

378
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:28,190
2.9 being a pretty

379
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,279
awesome priority level I

380
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:36,190
ciety this the scale at the issues
coming in as a lot less it's easier to

381
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:36,839
deal with

382
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:45,669
an about fifty percent of our programs
are private

383
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:49,179
I summer the wider public public
programs have five designated staff

384
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:50,530
responding to some missions

385
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,539
on Facebook stat 1702 missions in a year

386
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:59,030
on I

387
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:03,440
more than 92 mission today no holidays
never

388
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,370
never leaving the office I'm and you
have to think it's not just like

389
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:11,600
validating the issue in and figuring out
is this a I I think it's actually liked

390
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,380
working with the researcher and
understanding what he's

391
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,299
and communicating back and forth and
researchers will argue for it

392
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:23,789
I'm and and oftentimes it takes a while
to see eye to eye

393
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:27,020
so it's not just literally responding to
a researcher its having a dialogue with

394
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,580
literature

395
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:34,289
I'm to something to think about that so
our programs

396
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:38,640
I one person responding to 2400 issues
in the air another one

397
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,429
1800 issues with half a percent if you
are perfect researchers get frustrated

398
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:48,890
for weeks to respond to something and
okay I go somewhere else

399
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:53,110
I but I think city up

400
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:57,830
it's a good time to mention I a I
wouldn't advise using enough for this

401
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,539
I'm even and I think United side with
you know it's hard to say you know it

402
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:02,990
may be that goes back to a tracker

403
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,860
I'm but eternity is a platform

404
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,230
use it use abused and desk something
something to track these thank you just

405
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:16,820
quickly get overwhelmed if you launch
publicly I'm

406
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:24,590
so what about submission

407
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,840
this happens I am

408
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,880
there's an issue where

409
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,040
a customer gets new

410
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,230
like this has happened where customer
gets an issue I

411
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,559
the researchers able to to get our CE
and live customer sites

412
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,960
but the customer saying they didn't
follow are extra security steps are

413
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,140
installation document should you reward
it

414
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:57,200
why

415
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,970
but this customers getting exploited
with this not their problem

416
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,289
where's that line

417
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:11,799
yeah threat the

418
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:14,990
yep that

419
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:20,000
I

420
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,899
priority matrix just give you a sense of
sort of what's in each priority

421
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:27,309
x60

422
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:30,510
pick one direction you should have this
you should think about this before you

423
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,230
start a program

424
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,740
you should absolutely know how you can
break down issues and if possible

425
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,919
communicate that up right

426
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,840
the more communication can put up front
the better I'm

427
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,710
you always want to be able to push back

428
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:48,659
up to something in the brief you won't
be able to say we said this isn't

429
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:52,000
a valid issue in the brief so as much as
possible

430
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,220
put the information in the breed I am

431
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:01,460
across all programs invited duplicates

432
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:07,149
66 percent give or take

433
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:13,510
68 69 percent I

434
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:17,130
this is pretty send 20 percent valid
issues

435
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:24,100
some higher some lower up

436
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,740
now now or

437
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:34,840
reserved up

438
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,159
the best thing you can do is respond
quickly

439
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,610
if you pay I do anything about it if you
have people get what happens

440
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,580
he does his body and it doesn't body and
i would tell my body and like

441
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,720
we all make money I with that

442
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:58,279
sticker days yeah

443
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:02,399
a course of course I think yeah like you
have to manage that

444
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,970
and I've got a fraud system in place how
you gonna do that

445
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:14,940
good luck up

446
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,490
abt

447
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:21,890
absolutely yep

448
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:34,340
yep

449
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:40,990
they put a jest who was yeah where up

450
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,760
yeah yeah yep

451
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,500
did you get a tough the goal should be
to minimize to get as much as possible

452
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,880
if I know the private programs

453
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,120
it gets down to you 30

454
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,130
and less than that 20 percent tomorrow
on that we do our best to manage to get

455
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,630
this is a function of too many
researchers on up i'd and not enough

456
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,260
quick fixes on programs to

457
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:07,960
I bike yeah exactly and a lot of
programs like

458
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:16,830
some things don't ever get fixed it stop

459
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,350
would he do that is outta scopes

460
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:22,970
I'm here's a story a researcher found

461
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,640
an issue with

462
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,850
I read again a hardware device I'm where
did the bill tools were on get help

463
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,140
and porpoise

464
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:41,460
get up to listen to is on repost
basically clone the repository two

465
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,870
minutes made it an issue

466
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:48,370
I'm let them know that he had access
that could have repository they've

467
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,200
removed to get up repository but he
still had a clone

468
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,179
they found out about it

469
00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:00,500
and they said we thought we removed this

470
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:06,570
wise it's still here not happy

471
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:10,140
not a happy interaction on

472
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:15,020
were is this in scope

473
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,929
is get help in scope and nodding I got
that

474
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:23,580
shaking up had to be there wanna there
there had to get everybody very

475
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,919
literally had credentials

476
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:31,940
for Davin cue a systems and well

477
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,110
is it really get had issues so basically
they put their built was up

478
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,190
11 developer but the bill to ease up on
get up

479
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,990
publisher with passwords in a know we
found it

480
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,179
and talk about it during the body the
researchers found

481
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:51,470
password use those passwords to log into
the dev environment the Q environment

482
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,700
and it was a mobile body again

483
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,520
where this stuff is again technocrats up
to almost two two things are moved from

484
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,159
moscow

485
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,640
should you pay for

486
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,049
now the dev environment basically would
have allowed him to

487
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:09,500
craft new for more and then distribute
and all the customers

488
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,290
so that feels pretty in scope

489
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,820
Anna something to think about there's
other other examples this

490
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,430
I'm

491
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,410
it did the sorta really thought I was
going back to is if you're going to

492
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:27,950
change it

493
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,120
you make a change pay for

494
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,590
and that's a pretty good like

495
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:40,850
got feel in terms of whether or not it's
important to you

496
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:47,210
an there's other examples this

497
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,870
a confluence page where they'd stored
there

498
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,500
credentials financial information

499
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,460
everything in a third-party wiki posted
on complex hope poster by last year

500
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,610
researcher got access to it

501
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,210
on was basically shot sign up

502
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,240
so you going in South Africa

503
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,580
it to access financial information get
you access to you

504
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,940
company information password

505
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,600
at ASCO

506
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,080
defense you can change it pay for

507
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,710
I another example France

508
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,780
detect if I I'm this is

509
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,000
often in scope largely because like it
it end up affecting them and basically

510
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,900
what happens is

511
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,490
you start a new search start using her
local right

512
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,530
you point a sub demand

513
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:46,950
ap dot your company dot com to her okay

514
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:50,800
I'm whatever app goes away

515
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,490
stop using it you forget to remove the
subdomain

516
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,020
researcher comes in anybody comes in

517
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,280
registers that with her rocker now
they've got

518
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:13,930
a subdomain on your dement ASCO

519
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:17,700
%uh lots people pay for that one that
was a pretty big issue

520
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,590
on the details are there actually if you
get a chance check it out I

521
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:25,790
this is just this is a good too

522
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:29,440
lesson I that we've lacked attacks in
areas

523
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,140
if you get an issue and you can't
reproduce it and you can't seem to

524
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,890
figure out

525
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,510
whether it's in that a problem not
correctly xaqsoor

526
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:42,230
how would you use this push the
researcher to come up with the attack

527
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,800
scenario

528
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,990
all the prerequisites they've made
everything

529
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:55,440
to actually reproduce the issue cool

530
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,130
invalid issue

531
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,780
now on

532
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,880
David's if it's not an issue that you
can reproduce them

533
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,140
define a one example it one way to deal
with it too is it

534
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:12,270
the it's possible that reproduces in the
researchers environment

535
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:16,880
but not in your car how do you deal with
that shared environment

536
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:27,020
right give them a place to reproduce it
handling upstream issues

537
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:31,590
this is one that came and multiple times

538
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:35,390
a early and 2014

539
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:40,149
I believe and over the course of six
months we got a bunch of

540
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:43,649
issues basically to file existence
disclosure

541
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:47,380
but so think like you can go to ap dot
com

542
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,280
I'm slash

543
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,940
whatever dot chase on I'm

544
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,260
and determine if the file exists or or
basically they figure out if if local

545
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,290
files exist even

546
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,900
at the password things like that I'm

547
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,290
who should upstream those issues a
researcher

548
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:11,750
customer Anna but be explicit about

549
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:17,970
talk to the researcher about

550
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,480
I in this case the researcher actually
reported

551
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,640
yep stand but reported it to

552
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,820
everybody running Ruby on the platform
before he absurd

553
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,430
which is OK I mean ultimately
everybody's running abounding

554
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:36,369
what about swag real

555
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:40,560
swagger worth this is literally somehow
we had a ship

556
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,390
a teacher beside the liquor shop 6

557
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,710
I T SCHIP to ship

558
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:57,460
are you kept analysts a hacer I gotta

559
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,920
Eclat I a lot I am

560
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,970
back the United United will provide a
path for each qualifying but once the

561
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,160
issues that are needed

562
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,420
what about those issues that could never
get remediated I made this right

563
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,700
I'm ninety days

564
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,160
probably optimistic I'm we think it
general we we ask

565
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,930
I'm we give people a day a window and we
say

566
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,950
if you haven't done anything with the
bug in 60 days considered abandoned

567
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:35,440
am if it's already validated

568
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,839
if there's a dollar amount side to it
good close-up I'm sixty days is a pretty

569
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:41,780
good rule of thumb

570
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:54,880
for activity on about ninety days a
little much

571
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,170
his

572
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:03,230
yep so so we often end up acting as a
party I

573
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,160
side just

574
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,380
so depends on the butt

575
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,190
I'm the way it so it works for us I some
ish incomes and

576
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,240
I'm gets looked at

577
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,260
get a priority and a validation like is
a valid as a reproducible

578
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,590
is an issue I'm then gets

579
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,590
prioritize for the customer and look

580
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,140
they look at it and if they don't
respond within sixty days

581
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:35,780
it goes back to that status to getting
the priority the validation so

582
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,260
if it's reproducible and it's not a
scope or duplicate

583
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:45,460
you get that anyway the quicker the
feedback loop

584
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,190
the better I'm so you know four weeks
for a response

585
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:54,440
you probably not just got a lot on
testing I

586
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,990
bumping rights as always it into idea
with a big second but that's when

587
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,560
actually release cash awards

588
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,730
up to speed up just a little bit and you
can use focus areas

589
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,910
so I'm points where I'm

590
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,820
if new code was released if you put that
in from researchers that's a good way to

591
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,600
to get more activity important thing to
remember

592
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,830
it's all about the relationship with the
researchers I'm you want to be able to

593
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:23,420
find the best researchers and have them
come back to you

594
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,820
we find that the best researchers I'm

595
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,920
are really valuable I'm

596
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,040
and you should in general cater to them
as much as possible

597
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,700
I'm yep

598
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,800
perfect example this I'm researcher got
access to

599
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,070
a bicep actually I think a bicycle
database

600
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:53,650
through sequence action on a lot
parameter to have access to the database

601
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,480
was able to pull out the ashes crack
those ashes

602
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,680
what the database password ru ru

603
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,579
about thanks use to login to the to the
database

604
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:09,440
contacted support right

605
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,579
that's it's important to maintain good
ties with those folks

606
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:18,079
I mean we do a lot of that and

607
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,150
and in a we the customer will the
password shortly thereafter

608
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:27,880
up

609
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:44,820
set records any questions yep

610
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,730
I'm so really question I'm

611
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,450
about about that does it

612
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,840
and then I'll talk about how you can do
it regardless I'm

613
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,240
way with us we look at folks with a
minute before who

614
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,020
are good which on value have had a lotta
accepted sufficient

615
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,120
I'm and then give them opportunities to
participate

616
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,810
I what we're starting to see is people
running

617
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:12,390
public programs and private programs

618
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,600
so the public program without an
insanity just responsible disclosure

619
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,980
and the private program with rewards

620
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,470
where they're actually incentivizing
disclosure which is working pretty well

621
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:23,920
for that

622
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:33,770
another question

623
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:37,280
days

624
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,059
yep to so the question was google
recently started program

625
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:46,079
to pay researchers before they do
research I'm it sounds like a contract

626
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:46,420
to me

627
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,130
at depends on the terms of the contract
I mean this is how we do most security

628
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:50,839
today right

629
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:56,030
but they're paying per bug use

630
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:02,970
it

631
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,690
so it's like a retainer should like to
retain

632
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:10,680
yeah it I mean seems good do you like it

633
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,510
have you done it okay ca

634
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:17,660
me to call Google I

635
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:29,420
any other questions yep

636
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,600
where is that a lot yep there was a lot

637
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,800
I he gets into the CFAA

638
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,810
in the US what is authorized access one
is unauthorized access

639
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:44,650
I'm wasn't it a step too far to set a
password to recruit

640
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,510
in a I mean it's something to think
about

641
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:52,590
I'm I think rule of thumb is yeah if
you're using

642
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,770
credentials to log into our site it's
time to report it

643
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:00,210
on because we get so many duplicates

644
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,250
on I feel relatively confident in saying
if you find somebody else can find

645
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,330
I'm so you risk losing your work

646
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:10,900
a

647
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,580
good question debatable

648
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,580
and your question

649
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:25,029
yet

650
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:30,620
up

651
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:34,960
yep yep

652
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,670
agree every we're working on well we're
gonna

653
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:42,620
yet not quite there yet that

654
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,870
