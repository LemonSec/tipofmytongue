yen thanks very much for getting a bit
sick as it is a

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,090
a long way to come from its a did

3
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,800
IQ will be up and running in just a
moment guns

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,800
this comes after listening to country
Australia

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,780
day what this a one person me

6
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:41,220
for the letterman each other analysts
say pick Michael this work

7
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,100
served

8
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:54,560
and Mustang

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,540
yet all right thank you very much
everybody for having me here today

10
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,540
there was kay night now I thought a lot
about what to do if it came out because

11
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,250
king that's meant to be sort a real
insight for I like really reflective in

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,510
you know looking at the industry in area

13
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,880
interesting things to take away with it
and the more I thought about what we

14
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,850
should do for an iPhone came out the
more I realize that a nap sick it's just

15
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,960
like it's crazy there is so much stuff
going on any time with or something gave

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,550
us something else and that's something
else

17
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,200
and on sale this really crazy stuff I
don't know what I should do is actually

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,700
turn this into

19
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,390
aquino's just crazy stuff that fifty
different crazy things that they told me

20
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,170
the story that was going on the industry

21
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,100
just on my cat fifty Shades Feb 6 an all
guy 350 different things

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,210
I've the next 45 minutes and %uh so that
a story where want to stop

23
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,220
was around to democratize I should have
hacking

24
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,500
know what I mean by this because this is
gonna be interesting thing

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,530
so what amazes very easy for anybody to
become a hacker

26
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,830
said he would say this kid lasted five
year old kid

27
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,149
heck he's dead ticks but we know we had
it because the news headlines is he

28
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,690
acted

29
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,820
but what he did with the best thing in
the controller

30
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,000
and manage to circumvent the printer
control so he did actually get a

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,069
privilege escalation

32
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:16,060
which is pretty cool ended up getting
these name up there on the marks of

33
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,569
security recesses page

34
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:20,970
and you'd be pretty stoked as a Deadman
years on a five-year business security

35
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,780
resisted

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,880
can get a bag ban thi is well say

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,280
anybody can become hedrick excited easy
loves it he's like a little but many

38
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,800
kidnaper

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,270
anybody can become ACA now the
interesting thing is that we've gotta

40
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,800
love tools out there that help people
become pack is very easily

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,680
so things like Bishop the Browns a
plugin so all you do is you just browse

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,650
around the internet

43
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,190
and it looks for vulnerabilities
likeness configure that mean

44
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,270
open source control systems it just does
it for you browse the net

45
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,330
and says he got it is this cynicism

46
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,000
and it does the heck employees so it's
very easy

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,130
to become hecka now if you do actually
wanna start using some intelligence

48
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,330
their letter to Charles A about had it
coming back

49
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,620
very easy to find tutorials with Google
Docs the look the crease during the

50
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,380
URL's

51
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,180
and then you go to the URL when you put
a single quite any get an internal

52
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,390
database exception

53
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,820
and then you go to the URL you copy it
and then you go and pasted

54
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,010
into heavy dews and you on all things
it's easy if you like to become heckling

55
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,580
this tutorials like this

56
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,240
so we make it rightly or wrongly very
accessible for anybody

57
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,900
to become a hacker now

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,120
not everybody wants to become hecka
sometimes the one hi rakha

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,320
tenants may have very very easy
distinctly higher

60
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,930
this is not the underground in the dot
where where you find

61
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,100
criminal masterminds in the underworld
this season mainstream consumer facing

62
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,150
hack a list of comments a nice
responsive design website

63
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,010
Scott smiling stock photos it's very
easy to go in just hire a hecka

64
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,340
to do you do anyway so much your head

65
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,480
if these guys the hackers are the
customers everybody looks so happy about

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,350
the fact that

67
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,760
you can stop a project for free it's
that simple

68
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,140
to become ACA now this has led to a few
other interesting things as well so one

69
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,890
other things

70
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,970
clearly this happened in recent years as
the sector's mode

71
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,510
so we've had activists mode now you may
be like mainly wondering

72
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,760
exactly what is a hack to this because I
see the term a lot and it seems to me a

73
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,210
little different things for different
people

74
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,600
and I really like swift on securities
taken if you don't fall asleep on

75
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,260
security

76
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,450
stop because he'll she'll who had a

77
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,680
is not awesome and I really like this
definition and so to speak to the

78
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,520
opportunism

79
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,220
the packing find some stuff on a will
come up with the reason later on they'll

80
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,750
be something these guys must've done
something wrong

81
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,540
and often that is the case

82
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,630
so we say things like this this is in
Australia few years ago

83
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,730
and its up tripwire passando

84
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,550
whatever the hell they want it to be for
that that I A this is a government

85
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,700
website now there must be something the
government's doing wrong right we'll

86
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,990
find something they've done that we
don't like

87
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:16,030
and will make it up and as it turns out
this particular site

88
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,330
it was it's hard not to government
website as it wasn't NGO

89
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,350
to support people with disabilities is a
sort a rehabilitation program and

90
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,240
frankly I think she's been a bit condom
she's been a little bit subtle

91
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,740
but this is what often happens right
this is just legitimate

92
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,410
honest business that its online it's
accessible

93
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,600
it's easy I'm never a problem as well

94
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,000
is that when he becomes so easy we see a
lot of stuff like this

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,660
so sailor kids and I mean kids but in
the sensible us

96
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,810
from some feel the owner and the Youngs
must be kids that's something the

97
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,560
legally children as well

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,370
and they're in there following the
tutorials to use heavy Julie

99
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,120
to whatever the thing at the time I P to
go in on stuff

100
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,220
and that's a real problem as well

101
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,720
if the interesting thing is everytime
atop a court with their moms that's a

102
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,760
look at the court because they too young
dream by freakin cow they literally

103
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,940
still children were

104
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,419
and the problem is I basically in the
criminalizing themselves very early

105
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:18,750
which is bad news the main used to be
they would have a nap a sprite

106
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,880
defense is doing something i should get
a kick up the ass for but not go to jail

107
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,599
for

108
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,880
and now because the accessibility of
packing

109
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,330
they end up in some serious trouble now
when they do get criminalize we get into

110
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,500
this world is like I now we've actually
got

111
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,240
look criminal hacking going up and will
have problems with criminal hacking is a

112
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,130
East I say

113
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,099
you know anything about the other
criminal pursuits like a break in the

114
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:43,740
service station or liquor store

115
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,160
I'm I get my head smashed him with a
baseball bat so there's that

116
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,349
but I could get high N and sit at the PC

117
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:53,510
any forgot my upset after a small
probably remain fairly anonymous

118
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,800
on my being a part of the world rugby on
extradition anyway

119
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,080
do you really wanna export someone from
the Ukraine for

120
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,159
DDoS Inc from nothing happened

121
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:07,599
such a safe business now the problem is
because it's such a site business and

122
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,710
it's so easy

123
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,659
for anyone to get into is we say love
the source stuff

124
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:16,030
and this is just the most random
pointless crap

125
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,930
that pops up this is on pace still an
ass load the data for the wells

126
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,409
had and then if you want to get your
data off the internet because apparently

127
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,979
can get out of the internet now

128
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:29,639
I send BTC so send us because when we
will take your things off the internet

129
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,650
which is of course medical school
doesn't work like that

130
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,440
it also goes to the other extreme this
comedy

131
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,129
opposite implementation with a guy like
a look he's a buncha data

132
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:43,169
causes a drop box 09 tropical sector
goes on placement

133
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:47,250
say he is I segmented nearly seven
million Dropbox account we gonna dump

134
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,270
him on pace been

135
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,110
and if you give me the coronal actually
be more counts

136
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,159
so this is kinda the reverse this is we
will put more stuff on the internet

137
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:01,250
if you give us money now what often
happens is when we see this sorta stuff

138
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,900
it is not of course Dropbox that's been
hacked in Dropbox

139
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,069
sitting up there on the net and when you
correlate these

140
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:12,060
data against different breaches so using
something like my however I'm kind

141
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,610
system

142
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,860
I'll take an email address from the drop
box at and would you know what we've

143
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,870
also got the snatcher

144
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,690
hack and facebook hack and cause all
this stuff is just replicated data sets

145
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,080
kids

146
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,180
watching kids hang on the pastebin
copying

147
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,069
rate pricing and then going to me
because I nando get your things off the

148
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:28,539
internet

149
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:32,570
so criminal activity like this is very

150
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,449
very accessible you gotta wonder how
successful it actually is meant as in

151
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,360
much sleep a bit kinda stuff but

152
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,690
there's a huge amount on the bet fifty
different grasses this address

153
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:47,100
i've a couple years against different
price so that

154
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,940
is nasty stuff now the other thing we
started saying critically last year

155
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,120
was this nice extortion months in this
one now this was actually physical miles

156
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,920
sent out to legitimate businesses

157
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,449
and now signing effectively look if you
don't give this one because mine

158
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:06,699
we got a damaged reputation so

159
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:10,910
we can define in bomb threats benders we
gonna damage or online reputation which

160
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,600
of course is extremely easy to do it

161
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,880
and the worrying thing about it is
assigning

162
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,440
all's not

163
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,040
take is one big point give us one big
point and it all goes away

164
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,750
and one big point is sort of level money

165
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,420
that you don't think too much about if
it's the safety your business

166
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,120
I mean as much as their hassles doing
this is one big point it's not too hard

167
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,100
to pay one big can make the problem go
away

168
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,260
bizarre to me because clearly nothing is
actually happened it's a protection

169
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,670
racket

170
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,070
just extortion reminds me that that
tightening same pulp fiction where they

171
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,770
talking about

172
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,960
the guy walks into the banking rob the
bank with a fine because he said the

173
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,810
little girl at the other end we got
killer if you don't give us the money

174
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,770
nothing's happened could be an empty
threat but this sort of thing happens

175
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,570
and people do pay be calling for

176
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,370
cause that makes a question so what not
criminals

177
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,360
doing with the because his is all have
them get money well it turns out a lot

178
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,980
of them by Brazilian hookers

179
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,120
now when you actually go around owning
raptors and

180
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,580
owning DNS and being able to control
name resolution across

181
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,680
some large number of rafters will you
can gone by Brazilian hookers because

182
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,710
you can start to stand up fishing pages

183
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,360
just about anythin so it does become
very easy

184
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,720
tracks the mount attacks which let's
give them credit for probably a little

185
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,380
bit more sophisticated and the other
ones who sensor for

186
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,380
so this remains a problem

187
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,470
obviously there is a lot of criminal
hacking going on and none of us really

188
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,360
want to see

189
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,510
esta graver malicious online activity

190
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,210
now one other things it does happen with
criminals

191
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,940
online is fortunately they're not all
that bright a lot over

192
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,520
are not all that bright Penn often they
are coming undone pretty spectacular

193
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
style as well

194
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,260
so one that was very big news recently

195
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,490
was this guy so this was Russell bit you
may know him is the Dread Pirate Roberts

196
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,839
emails and I him is

197
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,140
the founder and masterminded the soup
ride underground drug market and

198
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,880
russ was clearly having a little it a
troubled connecting through the store in

199
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,950
service with bill

200
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,290
so he wanted to ask a question about his
underground drug market

201
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,880
when he put the question about had i
connect my underground drug market on

202
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,320
Stack Overflow and it was a fairly
specific question

203
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,870
which was later part of the evidence
that got him convicted

204
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,980
any put it on the under an identity
which was stressful but

205
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,220
him inevitably did other things wrong
according to get arrested in is being

206
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,399
convicted he's tens of millions be
callin

207
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,649
confiscated but this is a simple things
ask the questions take a flight

208
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,480
someone on so along similar lines of
this guy

209
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,269
so he's been in the news a lot lately
jihadi John so he's the black who's gone

210
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:49,790
around chopping people's heads of

211
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,279
for reasons and the interesting thing
about she had John

212
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,550
is everyone's trying to figure out who
he is because he's got this

213
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,440
strong British accent manny's accent
doesn't quite match

214
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,579
the profile of what you'd expect some
jihadist in Syria to have

215
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:10,180
so try to figure out who is this guy and

216
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,279
what ends up happening is it it turns
out that he had a gun is in web design

217
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,339
say he wants to buy some web design
software so whom he is the interesting

218
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:18,740
thing

219
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,630
his tears chopping people's heads off he
doesn't want it he goes online any buys

220
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,279
the web design software from his IP
address in Syria

221
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:32,089
using his British student ID so not so
bright

222
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:37,310
and that in a way so warms the cockles
behind criminals are screwing up

223
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:43,190
left runs and I do end up getting caught
and often by frivolous reasons as well

224
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,269
and when it comes to criminals being
court

225
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:50,389
by frivolous reasons of the crazy things
and particularly fun to this one

226
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:53,699
you as my sense is a few years ago so

227
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:57,100
is a guy going around running Texas law
enforcement web sites

228
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,160
now the ban to Texas but I imagine that
they don't have

229
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,790
a lotta sense a humor and getting I and
hi effectiveness

230
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,889
but anyway so he's come up needs to look
at this good idea he's talking to his

231
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:09,440
missus

232
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,040
is it listed this I'll do this sign in
the newly neither

233
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,740
and take a photo with your eye fine and
it'll be credible piss them off

234
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,380
and a rub it in a movie it will be a lot
of laos

235
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,769
so she's done this with the iPhone
across what happens when you take a

236
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:25,730
photo with the iPhone

237
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,569
you get metadata except that you get let
long down a bit 7 decimal places

238
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:34,730
would get attached to the fight and
unfortunately for this bike he decided

239
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,720
not to scrub

240
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,779
the metadata from his photo before
posting in

241
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:41,200
which did leave them directly

242
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,160
to the lady here which led them directly
to him so good news all round really

243
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,700
further

244
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,510
for the good side there but what's
really interesting with these guys as

245
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,310
well

246
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,040
is attended to this couple and what
strikes me with that

247
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,800
is is they look so normal like they just
normal people that the shop before in

248
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,720
obviously the attitude he had an things
is done probably thought of what we

249
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,570
consider normal

250
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,670
but this is just a normal couple sitting
in the living room somewhere

251
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,389
owning Texas looking for some web-sites
and Saudi aspect that point anyone can

252
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:13,980
become

253
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,399
in a you can be perfectly normal person
in every other way God

254
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,990
but you're out there any web sites which
course

255
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,589
is pretty alarming now I also got me
thinking

256
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:28,180
there are so many people who ultimately
turned out to be a bit steep in other

257
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:28,690
ways

258
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,709
that ass successfully Mansingh these
online attacks so what is going on

259
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:36,199
and I we actually making it to easy on
the criminals

260
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:41,470
to be successful and when you have a
look at some other things that we are

261
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,510
building I say we collectively as

262
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,120
builders breakers people involved in
software industry now I like this one

263
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,000
because when you think about it is quite
ingenious analog in he's a high friction

264
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,660
bad usability so that experience in I
gotta remember your credentials in

265
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,310
yeah it's meant to be something that's
long and strong so what these guys are

266
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,570
so what we'll do

267
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:06,199
is he taking mobile number any put that
in and your password is the last four

268
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:08,810
digits in the mud on them because that
way you can remember it

269
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,649
now you can never give your mom a fine
up to anybody else anymore

270
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:16,709
however this is a much nicer

271
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:21,260
usability experience the charm your
password now we'll ask that this and

272
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,930
this is a minor sort of obscure little
website

273
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,339
but we also have things like this and
this was only from a couple weeks yes is

274
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:29,420
a better fit major

275
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,610
online betting agency now Betfair were
conscious that

276
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,880
password resets are also better than
anti usability patton their high

277
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,839
friction prices

278
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,699
you know you gotta wait for the mound
the race certain you know this kinda

279
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:45,180
stuff that makes life hot so they said
he's will do

280
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,110
right what you do easy put in you use
and I'm and you use and your email

281
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,579
address

282
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,560
you putting your best site and then here
is a person

283
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,260
said

284
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,400
but no email confirmation all you have
to do

285
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,430
show that you now an email address and
the best but

286
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,930
now you might think that silly but
there's a twist

287
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,560
there's a British journalist talking to
Betfair on Twitter &

288
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,500
had bets they were basically berating
him has a terrible terrible trade

289
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,029
exchange

290
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:16,279
which is Emma book at hand what betty
was saying is

291
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:20,839
yes but you use a name is a secret you
should not be giving you use and I'm

292
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,060
to anybody its effect on a mattress that
scare people send me e-mail I give them

293
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,339
the email address and then they send me
e-mail

294
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:33,070
and as for the best they being sacred
will I think we all know that

295
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,089
birthdays are by no means a sacred but
this was the implementation that they

296
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:39,770
did and I thought that this would
probably make life easier

297
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,730
in some way now sometimes

298
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,980
we go even further and I particularly
like implementations like this because

299
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,630
there is an ingenious side to this

300
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,490
mp3 yes this is credentials in
javascript

301
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,480
but there's I'm a post pics on the
server network latency nice ever

302
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,230
overhead

303
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,230
night hashing overhead on the CPU on the
server this

304
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,760
in many ways this actually works very
well yes the credentials have been the

305
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,510
JavaScript but it does work well

306
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,069
and you can almost time to get some guy
was in source code on a look there

307
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,559
it'll be fun and don't worry about that
but this sort of thing

308
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,990
happens and it continues to happen so
when we look at have a stupid criminal

309
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,000
successful

310
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,459
will sometimes we are making a rather
easy now we also do other things like

311
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,839
this so this is a site map

312
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,220
now site map is meant to be a resource
that describes all the other resources

313
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,840
on the site

314
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,000
so you go to the site map in at least
seven things that

315
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,790
and uses kind of our thing on a site
right so you would put

316
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,390
uses in the site map in credentials kind
about an attribute all the entities

317
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,770
which the put in the site map so maybe
it'll make sense in a

318
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,320
in a strange kind white but this was
literally site map

319
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,890
with all the users and all the
credentials in

320
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,530
so again it it does kinda make you
wonder if you don't necessarily have to

321
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,200
be super smart criminal

322
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,890
in order to be successful now having
said that some lease examples I little

323
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:06,620
bit frivolous

324
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,970
you know this is nuts and I'm sure that
you're probably like me and probably

325
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,180
know the same as before may never see it
again

326
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,960
but stuff that we do continue to see is
stuff like this and everybody will say

327
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,630
what this is

328
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,120
within about two seconds in this room I
suspect this audience knows exactly what

329
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,500
it is

330
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,700
but sale injection and is number one in
the top 10 in 2013 as number one in 2010

331
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,710
and it still

332
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:32,200
continues to be everywhere and people
saying how is this still thinking how do

333
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,570
we still do this because wasn't this a
remnant

334
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,790
all they wrote a programming language is
now OTA practices and all the things

335
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,280
that we've now learned

336
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,720
we shouldn't do and we don't do this
anymore accept this is from this year

337
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,460
this is Rob Lowe question few months ago
and this guy's written

338
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,970
an article on have to do a password
reset now eventually a password doesn't

339
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,480
reset

340
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,470
my best

341
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:00,440
maybe some other things to get reset as
well this example also included hey you

342
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,570
connect to the database

343
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,870
under the s I account which is
effectively got two outs and sickle cell

344
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,320
so we writing this stuff now and again I
say we collectively because it is their

345
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,010
industry

346
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,830
so second action continues to be thing
and I guess the concern is probably

347
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,890
still going to be

348
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,490
a thing in the next top 10 and sometime
after that

349
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,890
because we still writing this stuff and
the West thing is why you say these

350
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,280
pricing you read the comments

351
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,270
thank you has been very helpful I've
never gone and done is in my system

352
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,140
because people do go

353
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,630
and copy and paste the text and I bill
based systems in this white

354
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,760
you know what really bugs me wife is is
he just

355
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,150
literally fall into the key to success
with modern web frameworks these days it

356
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,740
is so

357
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,420
had to actually do things badly compared
to how easy it is to do things well

358
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:51,090
yet we still keep doing this now
sometimes

359
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,530
I'm also wondering in terms of their
uses only making it

360
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,030
too easy for users so even example what
I mean by that

361
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:03,100
I we make it too easy for them to
implement poor security

362
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,150
FSA guess ruth is ligated

363
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,520
is why do they need your birthdate do we
really need to keep the pitch waiting

364
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,250
sensitive class is a data

365
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,640
because you have a bit that you can look
in the Betfair you know you don't really

366
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,490
wanna be leaking this stuff in places
you have to wait for some reason I want

367
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,430
the best that

368
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,710
a fair enough but the thing that really
struck me

369
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,760
is the advice around the password never
get past the big in the little later

370
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,810
still the big in a small it is not maybe
it's a kid thing in

371
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,760
kids understand it better but keep it
short so

372
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,180
is easy to remember it's a bit hard to
argue with the fact that yes it would be

373
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,930
easy to remember

374
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:44,210
account to buy that but it's such

375
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,130
conflicting advice to everything else
that we chine tell consumers

376
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,590
and somewhere someone building the way
that put this in

377
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,320
know probably told to make sense but
they let that get through I didn't push

378
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,810
back

379
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,970
and we end up with Lego saying the right
thing to do

380
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,260
and almost even worse that is probably
kids begin with the young keep the

381
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,010
password short this is really not the
only kiko

382
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:09,280
so stuff like this is happening now
that's very supportive

383
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,700
by a high-level kinda vice let's just
keep it short

384
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,910
it'll be right and other times we get
really oddly specific about what we do

385
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,540
and don't like with passwords

386
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,210
virgin doesn't like mike is Branson says
very happy about this

387
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,500
now for some reason virgin had a whole
list

388
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,460
different words which they wouldn't
allow on the passage near this wasn't so

389
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,820
does

390
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,760
we have a minimum entropy in you've got
to have this many lower case and symbols

391
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,530
and all the other stuff the guys in the
passwords

392
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,920
this was we specifically don't like
waiters

393
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,990
and inevitably it makes you wonder

394
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,170
what I die and I don't mean wankers in
terms of the

395
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,660
you know the individual are that but in
terms of the actual word so what was it

396
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,090
about having that word

397
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,000
that in like because inevitably if
they're worried about offending someone

398
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,740
on the king of spin myself the phone he
is that as my password

399
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:05,210
so who else is looking at it because it
like it's not like the CPU gets upset

400
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,400
right there is an operator somewhere who
is looking

401
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,250
at the passwords so again really bad
sort of

402
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,520
ought advice and the other thing that we
tend to see a lot when we talk about

403
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,180
bad on security advice is we do struggle
a lot worse

404
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,850
security questions that cost security
questions

405
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,110
meant to be things that only you know
that shouldn't be easily discover

406
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:32,260
things like

407
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,000
where you went to school probably not
such a good idea at things like what's

408
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,480
the capital California probably not such
a good idea

409
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,770
that is a good

410
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,590
I written by that a question

411
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,080
I so that sorta thing is is oddly

412
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,270
specific and it really it's a pub trivia
questions on security question

413
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,570
but we see that and I think we struggle
up the security questions because

414
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:00,169
on the one hand we ask very odd
questions like this which anyone should

415
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:00,559
know

416
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,750
and then on the other hand we can ask
questions like this which nobody has any

417
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:09,590
idea about what so ever

418
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,800
that's probably not the nineties benazzo
here

419
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,790
but we do these themes

420
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:21,960
with their security questions and it is
a hard thing to find the right balance

421
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,170
fun something that's not too easily
discoverable but that you can remember

422
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,380
in this unique in all the rest a bit

423
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,320
and I got me wondering if maybe this
comes down to the way with educating

424
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
developers

425
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,890
so I we actually not giving developers
the right message

426
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,930
so is the guidance out there that's
making it hard for them

427
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:45,050
to do the right thing so I looked around
to find a little bit

428
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,890
advice online that teaches people about
application security

429
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:55,060
I found this one hey whats up YouTube
disconnection hacker 101 in today I'll

430
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,150
be teaching you guys

431
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,410
how to view other computers IP addresses

432
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:06,520
I we'd is you type in tracer T said base

433
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,630
artists causing chasity in space

434
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,300
now which one is you wanna take the site
yeah you want to view

435
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:19,740
so you wanna go HTTP cynical size

436
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:25,690
and no not cynical little dot Diane in
the website cycle she say a Google

437
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:32,530
group its name want to see how many IP's
are looking at Google right now

438
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,160
and like at this exact moment we're
gonna find how many people are looking

439
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,860
at Google water IP's are

440
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,980
and what your connection speed is here
we go what you don't raise thirty

441
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,280
space and in the website http

442
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,860
that night slashed last website I'm
doing Google

443
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,560
you are going to be that as example and
you internet and here we go

444
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,570
here they come 1234 I

445
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,830
6 Senate eighty

446
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,109
9 10 and hold it

447
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:08,679
holder alright 10 people are currently
using

448
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:14,179
a its

449
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:20,119
I look it's a good thing the kids get
involved right on its

450
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,700
a I decided I ones then going out and

451
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:30,059
I and using that yeah this is the funny
thing we do get very own advice

452
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,429
and its it's one thing same kids create
videos and again good running for

453
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:34,529
actually getting out and having

454
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:37,840
get this thing is got so many views you
wouldn't believe it as a high could hit

455
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,619
chip

456
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:43,729
many many many millions but they we get
other advice on line for developers

457
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:47,059
advice around things like let's set an
exercise

458
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:51,659
and you guys are going to need to
encrypt your credit card metal I want

459
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:52,440
you to do this

460
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,450
is unlikely to you by 64 bankrupted

461
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,599
because it looks infected at the other
end on an hour to my hits

462
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,989
you look at the airport

463
00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:08,460
to try some I

464
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,210
and it's a real worry because this

465
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,300
is the information that we giving
developers look at the time

466
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,910
that's the info was not %ah so that
Bellamy rape you lynn what that is the

467
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,650
information that they getting online

468
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:23,740
encryption is hot i mean i think
probably does this the do it caps a

469
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,970
realize how much you probably don't know
about encryption and then when you start

470
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,820
to look at other advice online you
realize how much other people don't know

471
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,110
about encryption as well

472
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:36,330
so this was a sec I have a question how
do I securely store my password in the

473
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,220
database

474
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,630
that this guy has come up with an
ingenious plan the 20 cities for each

475
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,260
character the past but you get the S key
value and you at five

476
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,470
and thinking essay the cryptid

477
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,310
I could take away five easy easy easy

478
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,360
and you don't have to worry that keys
are any luck on a rubbish that just gets

479
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,860
in the way

480
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,810
there to other responses as well to this
particular question

481
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:03,470
one of them was again by 64 and the
other one was instead of five

482
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:09,840
use that same just like twice as strong

483
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,140
and it works because you look at the
output and it just doesn't look like

484
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,549
anything dishonorable now we do learn a
lot

485
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:21,299
about the white people build systems by
looking at the questions they ask online

486
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:25,789
and sometimes we r rather poll

487
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:32,529
it's concerning

488
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:37,220
because this is telling us the way
people building systems online it's like

489
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,840
example before I said people put code
for the sequence section holes in things

490
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,320
like that online

491
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,179
and then all these people to thank you
thank you thank you thank you because

492
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,409
they've now gone built their systems in
this way

493
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:52,029
so that's very concerning but i wanna
just beat up on developers

494
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:55,950
because not always just developers it is
security pros as well

495
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,149
and I think sign the Security Auditor
isn't idiot

496
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:02,330
asking for the plain text version every
single pass within the system

497
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,820
and a name out with said plaintext
password every time someone changes that

498
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:11,120
the guy is an idiot oh and any product
case for SSH

499
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,590
so it just gets all those things
Security Auditor

500
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:19,309
asking questions so we catch spine
developers but I appreciate all site

501
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:23,100
that security is a complex thing and it
can be very hard for people to get their

502
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,799
head around

503
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:27,240
and sometimes it's just not clear what
is the difference between wing dings and

504
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,409
PDP

505
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:35,889
it is it is a complex spice

506
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:38,899
you can call to get it cuz the wing
things like little airplanes and things

507
00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:39,710
cousin

508
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,619
doesn't look like it's decipher belittle
so I can be confusing

509
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:47,929
I get that but I don't want to just
focus on

510
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:52,480
the builders and Iza securing systems
it's not always their fault in the

511
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,580
reality of it is

512
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,460
sometimes we do you just have downright
problems with their uses

513
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,450
they do do bad things said it wasn't
what I got hacked

514
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:06,090
Twitter hacked some news to muster got
hacked because that's how big the king

515
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,269
became mcdonald's

516
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:12,259
they decided they didn't like the water
and now they like the Big Mac and it was

517
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:13,049
all over Twitter

518
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:16,879
tangentially they actually picked up
thirty thousand followers overnight

519
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:17,799
after this happened

520
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,989
couple years ago it's a little marketing
ploy name I'm

521
00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:25,509
but the headlines were Twitter was
hacked and every time someone chooses a

522
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:28,470
crack password all I reuse at all but
put it somewhere

523
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,539
discoverable its Twitter has hacked

524
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:38,509
now the same thing happened to tv5 monde
in france recently

525
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:42,320
he has a sameness so hence as well as I
haven't seen this they're interviewing

526
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,110
the reporter

527
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,789
and is going as a we've been hacked in
the that that

528
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:50,169
and yes I the back we showed a a.m.

529
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:55,509
up on the board and Hans that probably
would help but

530
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:58,899
they're not be discussing other people's
passwords and public talks we should do

531
00:29:58,899 --> 00:29:59,429
that later

532
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:03,639
I so this is the thing happens in the
Saudi guy Kyle okay

533
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:07,929
alright it's stupid to have it up there
a public message thing seven film crew

534
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:08,720
and they fill me in

535
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,289
the but it's a one of them it's not like
that sort of thing happens very much

536
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:13,389
until they do it again

537
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:18,590
and the next day there

538
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:23,269
and up on the keyboard we have
credentials again

539
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:27,129
enhance again so this other stuff
happens

540
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:33,139
and it is uses making bad decisions but
equally uses get very confusing messages

541
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:36,769
because they see things like this they
see a QR

542
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:40,690
SCANA and the Q ask Anna needs access to

543
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:45,080
calendars context like Asians because a
sec you askin is work right like i three

544
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,250
African address book and look at he
having lunch with

545
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:51,460
and the real problem for the user

546
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,379
is what's the one thing these assays on
that screen except what what is the

547
00:30:56,379 --> 00:30:59,500
button that is stopping me from doing
the thing that I wanna do what do I need

548
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,159
to press to go on and actually be
productive

549
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,789
and we are building the systems we
collectively

550
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:09,539
as builders so that a little bit a
responsibility to it

551
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,629
preparation also consumers are getting a
lot of really AWD

552
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:17,019
mixed messages about security and
consumers now have to decide between

553
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:23,370
having a nice day my cable with
antivirus protection or not

554
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,470
now we know there's a lot of other

555
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:29,230
about HDMI cables but this takes it to a
whole nother level

556
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,559
and yeah the you gotta saw the picture
the consumer as well because it you know

557
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,840
the guys in the story is going well this
one's got any rust protection this was

558
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,049
nothing alarming another

559
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:43,409
and it's got my lower

560
00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:48,259
United's it is made hired on consumers
in order to be able to make the right

561
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:48,860
decisions

562
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,259
and I had to wonder if maybe one other
things that make me how to consumers

563
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:58,070
he's the getting very mixed messages
particularly by social media they get

564
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,830
messages

565
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,049
that a counter to the message that we
would really like to give them about

566
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:03,409
application security

567
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:06,990
so often it's things like just wanting
to use a strong password

568
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,730
no one is more than twelve characters
from a passer well you can't because

569
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,490
security

570
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:15,490
make sense that's all the consumer gets
back

571
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:18,529
so social media in particular

572
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:24,669
is really bad at giving crazy bus now on
other times we find that consumers a

573
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:26,539
genuinely trying to do the right thing

574
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:30,470
they want to use strong passwords they
want to use password matches and

575
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,049
sometimes possibly have to pace the
password into the EBT

576
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:38,080
but if they did that be up could lose a
security certificate

577
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,940
and they could be brute force attacked
now I'm kinda curious his the hell you

578
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,960
have a brute force attack because your
pricing is like the dis- have all these

579
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,370
people animals just pasting at the same
time

580
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,770
and then at the end the security
certificates is gone

581
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:58,190
this happens allegedly so social media
is giving some really bad advice

582
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,950
in terms of the reasons why things are
done with application security

583
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,490
but they're also giving bad advice
intend to practice is to help people

584
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,690
should protect

585
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:11,520
personally identifiable information just
checking to limit the him

586
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,560
you know I'm just some Twitter account
was just replied to you and trust me I

587
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,090
do have the little blue like the thingy
which means I'm fine

588
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:21,400
just a big titted have but just put it
in a DM and send it to me and then we'll

589
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:21,990
see

590
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:26,240
on your Twitter time on your machine in
the clear and also the net with a time

591
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,410
line in the clear and will probably fire
off an email and AM as well

592
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:34,950
but don't worry stood so device from
social media

593
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:40,560
is often atrociously bad but at least
you can kind of understand this one

594
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,580
other one myself a few years ago that
I'm social work at take me three is

595
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:53,370
if anyone knows what this means

596
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,799
this is not my it up I

597
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:00,700
if you work it out please let me know
now

598
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,530
as much as this is amusing it's very
subtle I level basic stuff just crappy

599
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,129
advice for social media and clearly what
we won

600
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,730
social media manages to do is just take
the discussion of line

601
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:16,040
he concerned let's maybe not the in the
past said that maybe we have a private

602
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,950
chat about things

603
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:20,480
good but at the other end of the
spectrum is that governments

604
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,119
and of course we have learned an awful
lot about governments in recent years

605
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,330
we've learned things

606
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:31,340
that in many ways their worst fears now
many why some other also amazingly cool

607
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,119
and the NSA's toy box did have some
pretty good stuff in it

608
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,970
to things like rights mast which
festival is a tightly orson I'm

609
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:43,730
its side danes bone this was a white 7 a
VGA cable

610
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,919
they put on a little red line in the
major cable by China right now and

611
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,810
remotely and then I can see

612
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:54,090
what is on the screen which is
enormously cool it is very very James

613
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:54,810
monster

614
00:34:54,810 --> 00:35:00,320
and again horseman choosing and I'm what
are the other things that he is really

615
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,250
interesting that we did learn about
government's

616
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,560
was about how effective many the
security controls that we have

617
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,109
good free general access to really a

618
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:15,190
things like SSL I was so happy when they
found that SSL is missing in Sopot some

619
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,530
Google Network segments that they broke
down so during Americans

620
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,570
we've got this now classic smiley face

621
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:25,200
on the network segment that has no SSL
because there was so excited about it

622
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,200
because when it's done right SSL works
really well

623
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,990
and this is actually really interesting
for us because we know that we have very

624
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,350
easy access to this

625
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:38,750
now the problem of course is that SSL
works so well

626
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,840
that some people don't really like it
very much at all now we'll see what

627
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,540
comes out is i cant say

628
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,359
David Cameron all the UK managing
directly bankrupt General Ban SSL in any

629
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:49,869
sort of

630
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:53,810
feasible way it's just simply not going
to happen

631
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:57,490
it works too well its tourist activities
too much across the world for one

632
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,099
government will come on so we gonna

633
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:03,009
at Doral compromise a and every time I
try to that the past it really hasn't

634
00:36:03,009 --> 00:36:03,759
looked everywhere

635
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:07,829
so frankly the government stats look
pretty on heat

636
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:12,079
stan is this interesting thing here is
so you know governments economy to be

637
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,769
sensible right did not mean to the one
he changed things

638
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:19,529
but then we start thinking about on him
so we see stuff like this

639
00:36:19,529 --> 00:36:22,579
and nobody saw this coming

640
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:25,869
you know this was the craziest thing and
frankly I still have trouble believing

641
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:27,989
that this was dprk

642
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:31,749
and they're just gonna gatien's a place
in skulls and crossbones in the basement

643
00:36:31,749 --> 00:36:35,099
I mean I did base with you but the exit
that's a big point as far as in I'm

644
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:39,269
to sign and the funny thing is that we

645
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:43,150
we get used to thinking about
governments as wanting to infiltrates

646
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,690
and be pervasive and persistent and
silent annex will try to have a long

647
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,900
period of time

648
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,140
basically be pretty subtle and what they
do because that is what is most

649
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,759
effective for getting intelligence

650
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:56,400
it make sense cited just the face

651
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,200
is just a very very odd thing it
interesting thing with signing as well

652
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,329
as that we found

653
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:05,890
but that did have some serious impacts
in the physical world

654
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,309
so what I mean by that is a biopsy
pulled the maybe they were gonna show

655
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:10,809
the moving since the couple

656
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:15,359
they got threats against cinemas even
taking America got pulled from something

657
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,380
as been at it for a decade or something

658
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,999
but now we worried about upsetting the
access available and maybe though

659
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:25,339
United had to face another corporate
website so it's interesting to see how

660
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:28,359
abt sick does that to extend into the
physical world

661
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:32,059
and sometimes we find it's almost like

662
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:36,920
ep6 not ready for the physical world and
we see things that were probably just

663
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,519
never in anybody's threat model

664
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:41,529
and I'm well we write about

665
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:44,650
a government dprk an employee with the
window in it

666
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,819
here this is what comes undone you know

667
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:52,789
did we ever expected voted up medicine
so that's not think but of course one

668
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:56,329
other things about the physical world is
very good at circumventing digital

669
00:37:56,329 --> 00:37:57,349
controls

670
00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:00,529
because you can do things like this

671
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:03,729
it's still too fact there are many still
gonna head

672
00:38:03,729 --> 00:38:07,900
thing yes it is P into a board with all
the our site Aikens all the pins for the

673
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,990
outside taken sitting there behind the
webcam

674
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,550
each might not be publicly accessible
but

675
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:19,110
here we have and it is sorta this use of
physical world to circumvent digital

676
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,890
controls

677
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,030
now cause there is a lot about sick

678
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:27,119
happening the physical world and as we
connect more more things and more more

679
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,800
things have microprocessors

680
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,340
we do get worried about some other
testing is going on

681
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,920
so everyone probably saying chris L that
I am

682
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,180
he wants to take off love Chris one guy

683
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,490
I I could have hit bottom

684
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:48,380
yes I at you nice sitting with the guy
pen testing in a bus at 30,000 feet on

685
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,350
this not so sure about

686
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,650
not a frankly I think Chris ladies on
airplane because he doing some really

687
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,850
interesting stuff but

688
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:58,270
I just don't really wanna been applying
them it's just interesting also to see

689
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,730
have this is played out because I care
you know we we know these plugins and

690
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,380
devices he's probably got some info

691
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:08,070
if you read the news in my the plane fly
sideways it

692
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:11,650
is probably nasa more interested in that
than inside he's actually managed to

693
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,010
make me a Best Buy sideways

694
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,940
and then the whole thing's being blown
up wit he has admitted hijacking a plane

695
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,109
in midday

696
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:21,410
you know I'm not quite sure that's
exactly what it was but

697
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:26,030
here we are in things get blown out of
proportion but when we do talk about

698
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,150
connected things in Absecon course the
big thing that everybody's talking about

699
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:29,970
these days

700
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:36,000
is I A T so I A T is the new exciting
thing everybody's rushing to connect all

701
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,740
the things because for some reason
you're free does need to talk to your

702
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,369
toaster

703
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:42,890
and if you can be the first to market
with the toaster fridge bridge for some

704
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:43,500
reason

705
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,310
you will do very very well so we say
stuff like this this is Lee fix

706
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:51,830
this is an all the invention so on a
little bit easier however

707
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:55,740
it pretty cool bad light bulbs that are
connected so you can control the light

708
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,070
bulbs from its not fun

709
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:00,790
you can change the color in the mood in
the brightness seeking and a discover

710
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,310
mode

711
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:05,100
you know whatever you wanna do it I
which is kinda cool now let's take

712
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,859
did have a vulnerability last year and
the interesting thing is

713
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:15,520
as a people say well if my I A T thing
has a vulnerability do I really care

714
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,540
so do I really cares an attack that puts
my light bulbs

715
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,810
in to discover mode maybe not

716
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,590
but when the attack vector was that the
like lives

717
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,920
with leaking the wifi credentials the
network there on now I care

718
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,020
because now my lot holds Arabic the

719
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:38,160
into my internal network and this is
what people think about with it. it's

720
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,740
not just the device itself is when you
connecting it to

721
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:45,240
what do you interesting it with Miley
pics came out and said look

722
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,690
you know it's true that we had on
ability however we do not know if anyone

723
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,290
having been on by the light bulbs

724
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:55,370
which is good news you should all gum
patches like pubs

725
00:40:55,370 --> 00:41:00,340
I had a pets allowed pope

726
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,910
so they are people going to start to
think that had to actually keep the

727
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,690
i-eighty

728
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,920
themes up to date and patched in
securing why is that they never had to

729
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,200
think about before

730
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,780
and it's only getting we did because we
getting more and more

731
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:17,170
we'd I Etsy stuff so getting stuff for
the connected toilet

732
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,480
this is real is Japanese as are all good

733
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,940
12 things

734
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,640
and this is the companion app and the
companion app lets you control the

735
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,150
toilet

736
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,410
aspects Japanese that actually likes on
explain this to me

737
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:33,690
because I'm particularly interested in
that middle one which is like a calendar

738
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,069
with him with some kind of event-driven
daughter or something

739
00:41:37,069 --> 00:41:41,150
on it which is not immediately clear but

740
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,420
the thing about it is when you start
connecting a toilet you now have to be

741
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,230
worried about to take pictures on your
toilet

742
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,829
and there has been a security advisory

743
00:41:49,829 --> 00:42:02,309
related to the toilet and this is
enormously worrying because now you can

744
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:06,410
suffer a backdoor attacked by a toilet a

745
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:10,920
and that is about the scariest thing I
can leave you with incense this

746
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,910
wonderful industry

747
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:17,700
thank you very much

748
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:22,670
exact figures

749
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,810
where we have emerged round was really a
the 10th time for

750
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:31,300
12 precious nobody wins Best their own
thing that the toilet

751
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,700
good yet

752
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:43,500
gem ha I i think that as an absolute

753
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,290
it's an impossible thing and I think the
concept that it is either gonna be

754
