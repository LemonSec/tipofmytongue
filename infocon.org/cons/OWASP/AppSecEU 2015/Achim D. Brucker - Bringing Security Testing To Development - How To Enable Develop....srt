00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,770
and work with things like like automated

323
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,280
frameworks that already there

324
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:48,800

332
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,590
what he did for all

333
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:28,590
funny security assessment the product

ripe

335
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:43,679
and is now the questions moreover
comments on for mass transit since

336
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,829
fundamental importance to also

337
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:49,369
sell from time to time what's the
developers time right

338
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:53,270
sought to emphasize what they have done
well because this

339
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,530
first day the next time hope the new
millennium

340
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:01,190
and second you can move make the
relationship to YouTube it was better

341
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:04,730
so I dispatchers intestine someone who
has to tell them

342
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,930
reply to comment on what the or how they
have to could do stuff better

343
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:12,000
imagines is very important to tell them
the

344
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,380
dairies thing said they have done well
actually just a comment in question

345
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:29,089
thank you very much

346
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:32,460
for sharing your experience with this
and had a question about to

347
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,000
two aspects to this for forgive me if I
did mister the beginning I came in a bit

348
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,420
late

349
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,069
I'm trying to do the same thing in a
large global footprint to developers

350
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:43,339
and done and wondered how you handle the
skill

351
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:47,560
the global footprint and developers in
terms of education to maturity usage

352
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,170
and my second question is also Steelers
greatness is still is great for new

353
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:53,859
developments

354
00:35:53,859 --> 00:36:10,770
legacy what reproduction you catch that

355
00:36:10,770 --> 00:38:36,970
me

356
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:42,070
you

357
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,990
thanks for the great ok which is said

358
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:50,340
arm that it makes sense third to
implement security test this unit tests

359
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,400
and it's so should that be done by the
developers

360
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,000
can they do that with that rather be
done by the security experts

361
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:07,040
up

362
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:32,410
up

363
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:45,880
him

364
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,230
makes

365
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:53,569
biologist security expert lead

366

368
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:08,569
what skills move would you be looking
for exactly in spiegel

369

374
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:33,390
experts can be fine his me

375
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,410
very school since there's make sense

376

number this

377
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,390
first up

378
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,779
for security test I

379
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:54,190
people that software development some

380
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,680
that the No development

381
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,289

I'm you said that you have team steady
are

385
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,819
and and Thailand an extreme but they
also have a classic wonderful

386
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:29,069
in your experience and do you see

387
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,650
I more problems in agile are

388
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:44,810
are not who is soon

389
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,840
handling that

390
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,980
static code analysis results was
processing or looking at them and

391
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,300
decides if it's indeed an issue and
should be picked up by the development

392
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:53,630
teams

393
00:41:53,630 --> 00:42:02,730
possible the most secure meant

394
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:06,050
look results and

395
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:10,640

00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:00,710
fun secured point

408
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,410
I don't discuss sleep

409
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:07,470
I student

spend yep up

413
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:23,420
hunt on misused

414
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,710
and the UN used as soon as they are
known not to the

415
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:30,710
lot a false-positive shouldn't that
somebody March does not exploitable

416
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,109
because he lacks security knowledge
short commutes

417
00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:38,470
them catch all addition and then

418
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,800
said with

419
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:55,560
questions

420
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,470
thanks the talk I find the be about the
organizational design very interesting

421
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,090
is certainly crossover between the
people who are security experts on the

422
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:03,710
team's

423
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:39,019
and the people who carry out the
assessments at the end

424
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:42,789
okay I think we're can wrap up thanks a
lot for a talk

425
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:49,859
bump
