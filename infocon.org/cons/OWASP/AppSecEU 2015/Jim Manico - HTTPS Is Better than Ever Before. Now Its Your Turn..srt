1
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,760
you know I'm a big fan to leave I'll
even from Belgium

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,430
and he runs sec app dev another
non-profit developer Education

3
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,189
Foundation

4
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:24,950
out a Belgian to the I've been a part of
another nonprofit group so

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,380
I was too big leaving failed to work he
does trying to a

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,160
it the nonprofit way teacher helpers
about secure coding isn't enough for

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,360
that in the world so talk to him about
against sec

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,559
at Dave if you have a moment to before
the day is over my style love talk

9
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:44,040
is to go fast in cover a lot of material
that's just the way I roll so

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,350
and I wanted to and I wanted deliver my
slides to the to the foundation for you

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,899
modest speaker notes are in here as well
so the goal is for you to

12
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,620
on a blast to the stalk fast and furious
give you the deck

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,489
for continued study of yours if you so
care to so hang on your seats

14
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,309
hold on let's talk about HTTPS

15
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:06,420
what time do I have to speak until may
ask

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,670
to the dr Proctor's 10:35

17
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,280
so I have 30 three minutes

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,380
to do like an hour to have a material
let's

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,340
hi my name is Jim on the talk about
security I'm from United States so in

20
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,100
hollywood

21
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,320
we see people shooting at people and the
good guys never get shot

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,950
they'd ever get blown up but crypto
comes into play everything freaking

23
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,720
falls apart

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,640
oh they have crept away so bad luck in
the browser oh no we can't get to them

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,650
so this is look let's get beyond that
and talk about it for real right

26
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,729
this is some random guy off the air and
I had no idea who this guy is

27
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,240
I just rolled him over the internet he
trolls me about HTTPS

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,550
he said something really why's that I
want to get across your any on the crib

29
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,960
to traffic visible to the adversary

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,820
is not just info league it's not just a
confidentiality issue

31
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,180
it's doing to attack vector for the
attacker to inject attacks

32
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,140
they can use to exploit your system so
HTTPS is not just about confidentiality

33
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,170
to cover the jollity integrity
authenticity

34
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,720
authentication and so what benefits do
we get here we go comment reality

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,900
the adversarial spy on your network and
see your data

36
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,410
we also get integrity this really
important despite can't change your data

37
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,680
if you look at a pineapple device any
HEB connection going to a pineapple

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,110
you can check whatever script each mill
you want to the site with ease

39
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,269
so when I say integrity mucking around
HTTP the attacker on your network

40
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:33,489
in a trivial fashion can modify
everything

41
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:37,739
you also get authenticity to I go visit
you especially in a one-way fashion

42
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:38,410
you're deploying

43
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,070
one way to: less your server is
deploying HPS for

44
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,190
anyone to connect to an autonomously you
get authenticity

45
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,420
because life is your bank I know it's
the right bank how that system work

46
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,120
it's the certificate authority system
what do you all think

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,220
up the certificate authority system as
it stands today

48
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,620
and your answer should be something
along the lines of bullshit

49
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,720
or layers the bullshit or stinky
bullshit what want that one of the many

50
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,510
appropriate answers when analyzing the
CA authority system right

51
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,140
if you're part of the sea a system like
a marketing manager for CA

52
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,260
you want to lecture me about your
business in classes get out please you

53
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,160
don't need to be here right now is not
for you in

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,739
we'll talk about that later so I've had
ahead CA managers troll me why give this

55
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:21,560
talk because

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,850
we can only spend so much money on
security have

57
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,160
whatever the don't be in the business
right so when you do thi lest you get

58
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,590
two major benefits

59
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,380
attack we are using TLS you're using two
basic primitive crypto out a rather

60
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,740
crypto mechanism of symmetric and
asymmetric encryption why these used

61
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,290
together

62
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,270
you basically want some kind exc when
you're using symmetric encryption

63
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,410
was the big flaw that you can exchange
keys in public so

64
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,590
if I hope two parties can have a public
communication then revert to private

65
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,600
which Metra crypto

66
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,370
the whole purpose of like key exchange
algorithm like to be home in and so on

67
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,050
is now you when I anonymous

68
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,570
you would I in a public network can
conduct the key exchange tube to build

69
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,680
secure communications

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,100
the whole point of a symmetric crypto
well it's freaking slow

71
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,050
super slow it's not it's so slow it
wouldn't would break the internet that's

72
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,720
all we did

73
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,170
so we use asymmetric crypto to set up a
a strong connection

74
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,540
between two parties in public them drop
down just a metre crypto after exchange

75
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,440
key material

76
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,050
which is fast and furious and secure
with only a single key so I'd like to.

77
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,820
lesson and SSL for that matter

78
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,890
and that's really graceful you serve
multiple primitives

79
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,790
to conduct secure communications now it
to got a bad history

80
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,510
most what we've done in sont les to date
is broken

81
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,650
SSL one two and three are all gone
they're dead

82
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,940
so if you're using as a sole one two and
three in any way

83
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,530
turn off all your clients turn off on
our servers there's no benefit to using

84
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,190
anymore

85
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,820
we won at least you steal St less want
little iffy we want to be using TLS 1.2

86
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,230
as much as possible right

87
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,940
top let's get started you want to get
SSL you want to get TLS correct in some

88
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,410
way

89
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,970
the first thing you got to do is update
your OS the latest patch level if you're

90
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,340
still using Apache 1.3 what up

91
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,680
freak are you doing you've got to stop
doing that this is and a lifetime 2010

92
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,220
there's multiple 0 days are really
expensive on the grain markets black

93
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,220
markets for that matter

94
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,340
just up focus on getting a patch of 22
to 24 missile update your open this is a

95
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,630
library fixing numerous problems right
away

96
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,800
you would not believe how many folks are
at this level right now it is a big deal

97
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,270
so

98
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,080
get away from anything below patchy 13
is a quick note

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,580
up t less SSL is growing dramatically

100
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,160
so you know we're looking at the Aero
we're snowed in revealed something

101
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,780
be things a government to the world are
doing yes US but there are few other

102
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,310
come European authorities a part of that
whole thing as well right so if we do

103
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,710
that now we're moving into the area i IO
Ian and everything

104
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,590
where the rise up use up TLS is is
rising dramatically this is no longer an

105
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,870
obscure think this is now

106
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,540
a core part of how you deliver secure
software now again the problem is that

107
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,010
the tax on TLS are pretty as a cell
pretty significant we have a

108
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,820
we have a well marketed graphical aid in
history

109
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,400
a recent secure issues with TLS that we
have to address in some way

110
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,640
luckily for us it's usually patching it
usually in

111
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,840
easy issue to fix this when the fixes
are available but

112
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,170
TLS is up his is rising in use but also
rising and how researchers are analyzing

113
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,490
it so we have to be on top of this

114
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,600
today especially to be prepared for new
things to happen

115
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,150
now let's look at the history of issues
that we've seen in the authority system

116
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,460
first well that's one of my pet peeves
will talk about

117
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,260
certificate pinning to detect with an
authority goes bad it I think it's a

118
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,540
great place to start when talking about
modern

119
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,620
well-done TLS and you start with did you
know tar

120
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,520
and the first sentence chris says it did
you know tar was

121
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,260
a doctor to get authority owned by
someone in Seoul debatable who own them

122
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:53,680
but

123
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,530
with attacker got it did you know tar
I'm we had a

124
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,070
there will be begin issuing fraudulent
certificates why is it a big deal

125
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,230
whether CA ish tissue fraudulent
certificates was that the attacker do

126
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,330
more specifically they can't

127
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,940
the king at like you know pic a a kale
on my back yard

128
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:21,120
be specific they can't do everything
they can conduct man the middle

129
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,110
why why does that work because when your
browser

130
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,760
gets a fake certificate to a web server
that signed by a real authority

131
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,310
even if it's a fake certificate but it
signed by real authority

132
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,530
what is your browser say your browser
says party time no problem

133
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,419
where a that's the problem that's where
the hearts of the problem so

134
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:46,160
let's go ahead to February 2012 we have
US company Trustwave they serve most US

135
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,870
DOT

136
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,180
and the government

137
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,229
the they admitted that they took their
private key

138
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:55,570
put in HSM and went for sale

139
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,210
if I could take back to you what's your
name and pick on you urine what's that

140
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,460
all up

141
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,550
Aggies 20 if I give you a piece of a

142
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,250
HSM with the private certificate up a
core CA thats live in the browser today

143
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,280
I give it to you

144
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,800
what can you do with that how easy is
acting to be

145
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,100
trivial you can just issue any fraud and
certificate

146
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,720
to any website sign it with the HSM
whether private CA in it

147
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,199
s privacy through getting you command
know anyone with these in the browser

148
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:26,780
says

149
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,380
party time it is this the part the
problem here

150
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,789
the trust leaking clean they admitted
their mistake revoked a certificate

151
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,810
swore they would never do it again
Italian

152
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,310
I care about that when I care about is a
said something very telling back in 2004

153
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,870
they said

154
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,560
hey guess what other CA's out there
still there's private search for profit

155
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,400
and guess what the real answer to that
is to some degree which CA's would take

156
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,480
their private certain sell a prop in
some way if they can get away with in

157
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,300
the world today

158
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,910
my answer that is pretty much all this
is the world we live in

159
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,029
so let's go ahead now to December 2012

160
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:06,060
the Turkish government began issuing
fake

161
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,029
certificates to Gmail that were properly
signed by the truck trust authority

162
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:15,620
why would turkey issue Fig certificates
to Gmail trip opulence

163
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,029
that was signed by the real authority
what are they trying to do it rhymes

164
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:20,209
with the word fly

165
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:23,470
they were spying on their popular in
some way in

166
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,910
Google at this time had begun
implementing certificate penny

167
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:32,310
they took a copy of Gmail's public sir
in the early hardcoded in the browser

168
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,420
so you make eighty less about exchange
request you

169
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,440
talk to the server the server is back
did you back to prop up for a public key

170
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,870
a decir to start the conversation if
that doesn't match what Google has

171
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,490
hardcore in the browser

172
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,620
you're being man the middle no inform
the user in some way

173
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,100
and send a message back to Google to
inform Google which

174
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,380
authority had fraudulently signed to
speak gmail certificate took trust got

175
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,450
caught doing this

176
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,370
tornado I this news kinda went away that
their first when I get caught

177
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,990
what they did 2012 the group would
Google do they quietly tailed

178
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,959
ther trust not to do this on a blog
about it right this blog post was a

179
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,570
warning to everyone saying

180
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,060
hey everybody we are pinning love Google
search now

181
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,750
if you try to me and the Middle through
fraudulent you some CA certificates

182
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,450
we're gonna catch you read a blog about
it this is a message to the world

183
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,890
intelligent agencies and people who are
nation-state me in the middle ear Blue

184
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,620
Coat using the kinda techniques in
public ways whatever

185
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,910
this is the message to the world we now
go ahead you're December 2013

186
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,040
you're not gonna believe this the French
government the

187
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,089
up the the French certificate authority
the

188
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:42,250
Cyber Security Agency begin issuing fake
certificates to Gmail

189
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,660
that we're sorry that were fake not the
right you know that the right cert

190
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,410
and they were signed by Francis Cyber
Security Agency to work to be here

191
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,510
while the French government issue a
whole bunch a fake certificates to Gmail

192
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,130
signed by their authority fraudulent
what were they trying to do

193
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:03,360
trying is the key word here they're
trying to

194
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,160
who what are they trying to do it rhymes
with fly they're trying to spy on their

195
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,910
popular and

196
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,800
in some way now they got caught because
what everybody who was

197
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,339
analyzing this topic a SSL under Section
we knew that Google was pinning that was

198
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,279
a really big deal in the world the
vessel Thiel's interception

199
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,389
saw the French cyber security agency
doing

200
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:27,990
all year they were focusing on wait for
it frescoes hearts art

201
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,389
architecture poetry song dear loving

202
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:35,189
I'd like the French do what were they
not doing their basic

203
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:38,360
homework on science and mathematics so

204
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,639
now they got caught a group was like
French you are

205
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,029
out to the browser fully revoked the few
days later

206
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:49,519
grew up Google I are Mozilla Microsoft
the Opera all

207
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,779
not tomorrow the browser as well was a
huge deal to retired government being

208
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,139
knocked out in the browser

209
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,240
and all the sudden deal thousands if not
more sites around France stopper

210
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,600
stop working in the browser in a clean
way self the world we live in

211
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,100
what did what the French government say
what happened behind the scenes this was

212
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,999
not on purpose this was a

213
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:13,339
configuration air what a crock

214
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,470
Porsche heart so so now so it's not just

215
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,170
it's not just a authorities that are
making mistakes here we have a

216
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,429
registrar's with easy CSRF to change DNS

217
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:28,759
psyched you target the add me love that
domain CSRF against the Registrar

218
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:32,809
to change DNS this game over in terms of
security Robert open SSL

219
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:36,309
up the Hartley this is a basic buffer
overflow against

220
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:40,589
the heartbeat API buffer overflow lets
you steal data from the server

221
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:41,410
anonymously

222
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,410
when Hartley was was announced it was a
bit was a war on the floor for several

223
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,959
days between many governments in hacking
group pray

224
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:51,589
and just no less like 48 hours we've
heard about logjam now

225
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:55,120
so this is some guy on the internet I
think he smart I don't know he says

226
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,259
don't use exports savers and generate a
unique d each group that seems like good

227
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:00,540
advice is also saying

228
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,249
if you're running for 24-bit DH
diffie-hellman for key exchange

229
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:08,439
it don't don't use a common group factor
common ones you should be using 2048 if

230
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:10,299
you can deal with it for compatibility
issues

231
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:13,649
this is a legacy issues export ciphers
from twenty years ago

232
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:15,270
and they're biting us today

233
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,850
kinda crazy but so we have this coming
up as well but it could

234
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,860
yep

235
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,200
exactly but but the advice we get the
developers again a

236
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,020
just got my hands on this in like a
couple hours ago right so please please

237
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,700
bear with

238
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,920
the key thing is people are using old
broken ciphers

239
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,480
that were given during that the US era
up doing export

240
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,560
a doing export restrictions on Compal
other fees we made

241
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,510
export versions of all the main ciphers
that were easy for the US government to

242
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,690
to crack in some way and these are now
hard coded in physical devices and old

243
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,420
legacy systems are all over the place

244
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,700
and so basically its really easier if
you're not using export savers in

245
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,920
you build your own diffie-hellman group
but pretty easy chemo to the South Bay

246
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,020
is also client side issues in the
browser Chrome everyone is working on it

247
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,550
there other emerging issues being
discussed this just came out

248
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,310
to showing you a modern attacks against
logjam in that we have to be on top of

249
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,650
this

250
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,970
and be ready to react pretty quickly I'm
if we wanna

251
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,040
be on top the most recent HPS threat as
a lotta to research trying to crack

252
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,130
these these protocols

253
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,130
the basic mistake to developers is
you're sending

254
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:30,090
anything over HTTP my honest opinion
about 2015 is when should we be using

255
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,730
HTTP in 2014

256
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,180
can anybody give me a good reason when
we need to use HTTP

257
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:43,550
go ahead

258
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,090
okay so at least we get this right

259
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,200
you wanted could lead to clip my browser
to your

260
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,770
SSL by car load balancer over SSL

261
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,330
into plain text everywhere else inside
that is how almost every major breach

262
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:56,920
happened

263
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,080
I was talking to Daniel Cuthbert earlier
today daniel is a

264
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,360
a a red team where he goes just
combative security

265
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,540
for for various organizations and he
said gee am I asking him

266
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,030
how realistic is it for you to britain
organization start sniffing traffic is

267
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,110
likely explains that the gym

268
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,990
let me put this in line with what you
can understand when we have broken into

269
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,160
a network and start sniffing traffic
from as part of a test

270
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,540
as part of an engagement we haven't even
taken our pants off yet

271
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,100
we're just getting started so breaking
into a network

272
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,380
8 setting up some kinda sniffing
capability have even begun to make

273
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,500
yet we're just happy to take off her
pants yet are you with me now

274
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,390
that's how bad it is so the idea of this
were the biggest flaws here

275
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,580
when you're like terminating SSL early
in your infrastructure

276
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,900
that one of the biggest misuses love

277
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,230
I'm as will the biggest a up misuses of
course security control

278
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,870
you should be doing HTS or some kind of
strong Transport Security

279
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,880
anytime you're sending sensitive data
and this is a big deal cuz most

280
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,690
companies terminate at the boundary

281
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,700
into plain text everywhere so as an
attacker I go buy a piece a malware that

282
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,370
cost me

283
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,400
1995 you can get three words into this
for three domains

284
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,690
for only $39.95 and that's all I need to
sniff all your traffic stats

285
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,170
easy so um but let's charge on here
though

286
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:19,470
other failures we've seen as Apple had a
two-year bug CE 2014 1296

287
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,760
there's a huge deal because what pretty
much in one man the middle against

288
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,800
any i OS device OS X device for two
years except for

289
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,230
or chrome which has its own stack
where's the bug

290
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,790
the Student Code Review worth about say
it

291
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,360
where not just there

292
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:49,139
say say a ticket to a charter

293
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,319
say it what what live codes wonderful

294
00:16:52,319 --> 00:17:01,129
noticed that GATT code that's dead code
in this by chance

295
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:04,890
look at the second go to fail hey I got
a point there we go

296
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,990
look in a sec ago to fail here this
Joyce bill out here and free the buffer

297
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,870
disconnection

298
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:14,409
and this step this final check to make
sure that your search been sign properly

299
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:18,809
s always get this is dead code about you
but my compilers pick this up twenty

300
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:20,159
years ago dead code is an

301
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:23,740
easy thing for compiler to alert on and
yet this is in Apple code

302
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,939
so the two things happened here use a
back door or is complete negligence

303
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:31,970
in there saw for so for us Chelsea life
cycle for the most important piece of

304
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,740
the drives a heart other companies so

305
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,280
your mileage may vary we also issues
with the click the browser

306
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,190
the browser fails open when things go
wrong we give it we give

307
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,280
easy ways for users to keep on going in
the face seven security

308
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,000
I think browsers have gotten better at
this but up until recently

309
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,690
30 to 70 percent of people who cease
ssl/tls warnings

310
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,659
they just click through that and that's
a big problem now that's going to have a

311
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:56,539
big effect

312
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:00,780
on your business's is that chrome is
getting is turning into an activist crew

313
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,919
what I understand that Google is very
upset what happened with the US

314
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:04,470
government

315
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,950
was going after them in a very
adversarial way and they've been pushing

316
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,720
TLS really hard

317
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,909
everywhere they can to keep this junk at
bay so-called

318
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:16,720
Inc in Canary just set HTTP connections

319
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,370
isn't secure and all they're doing is
therapists in Canary we're not sure

320
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,330
what's going live

321
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,710
they're gonna set any HTTP web site
input that little broken X there

322
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,429
that's all they're doing and that's why
I have major ripple effect in terms of

323
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:30,120
customer service calls and the

324
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,159
marketing impressions of your website I
i frankly think it's a good idea

325
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:37,690
i think is the right move to make even
Mozilla these are some really crazy

326
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,000
hippie activists right

327
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,140
even even Mozilla's like world chrome
your

328
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,390
making some strong moves here there not
doing it yet but considering it so

329
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,870
google has got a lot of muscle Galway in
the room

330
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,820
and they're using it to try to gauge to
BS better is that good or bad early

331
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,920
are they being Justin noble I'm not
saying that but they are making a better

332
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,010
so by the way there so many excuses I
get

333
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,290
in terms of why we shouldn't use TLS one
of them is

334
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,900
certificates are too expensive or
difficult to obtain

335
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,309
well there's a let secret project coming
out where we get free search

336
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:14,420
even under sub domains and if you're too
cheap to buy a two to three hundred up

337
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,510
euro certificate

338
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,850
to protect your company that put you in
the category of CB

339
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,660
you're a cheap bastard right so isn t
less slow

340
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,590
ssl/tls low guess what folks not only
steal s not slow

341
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:32,100
T L s is faster and more performant

342
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,000
than HTTP serious go look at

343
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,260
is TL est best yet using HTTP 1.1 in the
speedy protocol

344
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:46,390
special ice compression and what not
your HTTPS well configure server

345
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,490
is faster and more performant

346
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:55,000
than HTTP picture go ahead took a quick
comment

347
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,490
America Corp

348
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,070
got you gotta thank you

349
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:06,660
dealer other one is all know when you
use strong HTTPS

350
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,740
that makes my security software that's a
monitoring all the people

351
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,190
work in a much more it harder for me to
work it's like whatever

352
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:18,010
if your site operator you're really
concerned about site loads the CDN that

353
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:18,340
have

354
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,160
HTTPS by default not to mention any
names the biggest

355
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,190
conch the complaint I hear a GPS is the
CDM bender

356
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,100
X doesn't support East vs well not to
mention your name some do and some have

357
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,090
a big problem with it

358
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:35,170
some 20 well by default and so they're
plenty other solutions in

359
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,700
0.2 British DPS is to stop you from
doing

360
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,810
junk against my connection anyways so
it's improving I got

361
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,840
14 minutes to improve HPS we'll see if
we can pull this off

362
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,400
we want to talk about at least wanna
talk about strict Transport Security

363
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,940
certificate pinning and forward secrecy
ciphers I think it's an interesting

364
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,880
topic as well

365
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,040
also don't go configure your server by
yourself

366
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,390
mozilla has done a massive amount of
work to build a server

367
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:05,130
TLS configuration generator you pick
which browsers you want to support one

368
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,700
support

369
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,520
all browsers like fire like up literally
all browsers like IE six

370
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,550
you want to support you know browsers
from Firefox one in chromatin above

371
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,640
or do you only support modern up-to-date
browser is not give you different

372
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,960
configuration options

373
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,040
based on what you to what you're trying
to pull off this is brilliance from

374
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,010
Mozilla give a lot of credit for that
work

375
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,820
is also I know how much you here in
Europe just love

376
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,620
and and follow all the NIS guidelines
yen this we love those american

377
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,040
cryptographic standards that have been

378
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,250
back toward by the NSA sorry about that
hoops but

379
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:41,150
this disc this post but this document
incredibly well-written thought-out

380
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,490
he should have a you know skepticism
anything you read but

381
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,060
this is a good thing to read if you're
if you wanna see a deeper practice

382
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,410
suggestions about Tia lessin your
infrastructure

383
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,760
and so the first big defensive thing I
want you to care about district

384
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,000
transport security

385
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,420
this the browser standard it's well
supported by most browsers

386
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,620
when you make a request to a server over
TLS

387
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,860
you can choose to respond by saying
strict transport security for a certain

388
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,280
number of seconds for all my sub domains
on the site

389
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,419
from that point on any time the browser
is told to make it HTTP

390
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:18,590
shoot your domain before that connection
is made it switches to https

391
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,080
so if like some javascript attack
redirect me too HDPE

392
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,259
no longer works with the standard when
this standard is in play

393
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:28,789
it won't work it's all sin search IP
addresses are playing tech connections

394
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:33,179
it works with any ports menus this use a
short duration increase it once you know

395
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:34,350
your be broken anything

396
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,470
it revoke its at the Max ages 0 um

397
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,070
yet the other keep yet here's what
browser support today as well

398
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,970
I mean Chrome Safari Opera Firefox which
we're in this for a while

399
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,970
only I he is behind the times because
they are their cheeky bastards thank you

400
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:54,049
now what's the problem which HS TS

401
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:58,600
H St S is flawed in a lot of ways but
still important because how does most

402
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,700
how do most new users in track with your
website the open up a browser

403
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,840
the type in the domain when I just type
in your domain

404
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,549
what to the browser default that
connection to so now you can HP

405
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:10,779
connection to my server

406
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:14,830
and I 302 redirect my site poll my site
only sports reached PS

407
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,899
now your browser redirect to https

408
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:21,950
now that we're doing HTS I deliver
strict Transport Security headers

409
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,100
and buying the browser to use https from
that point on for max age seconds

410
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,239
what is wrong with that scenario you all
up

411
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:32,259
are you ready so you're on the network
your the adversary

412
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:37,450
you see the first top what can you do
what you for saying they begin you can

413
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,230
do what you can do

414
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,739
even before that when I give you a hard
time you can do everything

415
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:46,450
now you can say everything alright you
own that you

416
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,190
you are you own it all exactly and by
the way randomly calling things I'm

417
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,259
class I highly encourage a keeper go on

418
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:56,629
so this is really it's only a few
thousand web sites do this today less

419
00:23:56,629 --> 00:23:58,019
than 2000 due today

420
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,909
you can set your site to use each SDSU's
HTTPS Everywhere

421
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:05,330
have a high max age that the preload
like the response center

422
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,529
then go to the coal project to basically
check in your website hardcoded into

423
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:10,210
chrome

424
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,639
so the initial hits to your site already
are configured for strict Transport

425
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:15,230
Security

426
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,210
so when you get approval to list and you
hard code your site into chrome

427
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:23,210
Firefox Safari I either all picking this
up as well we all agree on this

428
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,700
and the standard even the first hop
tried you HTTP

429
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,760
will get switched H

430
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,929
PS you need to do this to get HTTPS done
securely

431
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:36,399
and this is it doesn't scale well its it
so it's still new and wonky but you need

432
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:39,590
to do the preload list if you want real

433
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,039
HCPs moving forward a lot other attacks
to compromise it any time to browse it

434
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:44,970
to do HTTP

435
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,940
so the other print problem is the too
much trust in authorities we talked

436
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,899
about that already

437
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:53,230
you have a Technical Certificate pinning
to keep continuity scheme

438
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,260
you either hard code your search in the
client or

439
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,640
or you are trust the very first up

440
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,630
request you making the for sure you grab
and if it changes from that point on the

441
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,570
flag the user

442
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,570
there's tofu pinning trust on first use
and there's like a priority when you

443
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:12,230
hard code the the certificate there's a
great chichi to reject Jeffrey Walton

444
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,809
from the open SSL project to discuss
this with us

445
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:18,980
it's a way for you to detect when things
go bad with an authority when

446
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,820
this not just your thirty going bad its
any authority going bad

447
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,830
to give you a fixer it doesn't matter
what you've paid

448
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,580
the the human form the users are being
manned the middle and so

449
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,360
in a mobile app this trivial in the

450
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,409
not revealed easy right in a decline
it's not so bad

451
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:40,559
in a browser to actually much more
difficult you have to use the

452
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,659
experimental

453
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:46,190
I ETF pinning headers age group in the
hasher multiple search

454
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,110
and pin that in the browser for certain
amount of time and feel even as well

455
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,480
actually

456
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,789
for me about this a couple years ago
this is really it is doable

457
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:58,059
but here that here's what goes wrong
suppose you Panesar two weeks before

458
00:25:58,059 --> 00:25:59,460
it's going to expire

459
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,480
and you pin it for three months what did
you just do leavin

460
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,279
party be specifically even when I have a

461
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,620
when I have a pin time in three months
and you the cert about to expire in two

462
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,179
weeks

463
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:18,390
what I just due to all those users yet
used in I love service those users to

464
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,419
stop them from being able to use your
site

465
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:24,380
so here's your strategies always have a
backup in from a different CA as part of

466
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,330
your planning strategy

467
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,940
when you're certain is about to expire
like to export expires too late about a

468
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,750
year

469
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:34,899
before it expires get into certain pin
it so an expiration time comes you can

470
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:36,279
drop it on your pin header

471
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:39,549
without any kind over account to the
problem doctor

472
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:42,840
to what's up good to see you

473
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,210
giving up giving up too much me out come
out

474
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,669
doctor top cover for second receive good
to see you

475
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:54,389
with your question i havent seen you in
so long doctor wetter

476
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:57,499
up doctor matter

477
00:26:57,499 --> 00:27:00,659
gentleman excuse us to man up

478
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,659
doctor wetter a skit but through make

479
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:12,489
plated what your question go go go
what's that

480
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:17,899
all it's actually request for comments
now it's no longer experimental

481
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:21,109
this is now a formal w3c

482
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:31,869
standard request for an in the request
for comments: face

483
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:35,320
ok right

484
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,799
like like that I have 1/2-inch will be a
vocal pins your shower one

485
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:43,590
show one and shot 56 yeah

486
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,509
awesome let's change this right we're
having a moment we gotta we gotta keep

487
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:49,179
dissing spectrum to deliver the city a

488
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:52,389
doctor whether awesome I'll pick this
even more before

489
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:55,820
both before the cops is over thank you
see how these

490
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,029
have these headers available again you
get your to get caught with exploration

491
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:01,929
issue so make sure that you're a

492
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:05,350
you have a spare shirt from a different
CA

493
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,429
Radha hot swap in make sure that you
have a

494
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:11,580
that a year before things expire you
begin a pin as well so well

495
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,789
expiration boundaries are past year
already ready for questions

496
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:24,340
that outta my area immediate
understanding so I'd

497
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,989
I'm just not that deep into that
particular thing so I i may be smart

498
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:32,190
I hope you're smart listen to him right
hood

499
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,210
and I have a section here from the co
author of this

500
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,149
on steeply in that those kinda issue so
obviously from in the deck from the skip

501
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:41,139
over to make atomic up six minutes let's
go

502
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:44,529
um we did that already we talked about
this already

503
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:48,440
this is what chrome does when it sees
that you're painting has been violated

504
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,450
in some way

505
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,559
it also sent a note to cool so they know
which CA

506
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,609
did this as well so are you can actually
keep figured the UART the

507
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,629
the reporting URL to tell yourself

508
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:02,700
what happened with CH did a fixer or

509
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,779
what went down I see you can the

510
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:08,700
react to that event in some way as part
of the standard just like content

511
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,249
security policy reporting API

512
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,789
I think this is a good job your
connection is not private

513
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:17,129
attackers might be trying to your
information for the Google with your

514
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:20,450
passwords messes our credit card it is
really clear message that they hit

515
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:20,999
reload

516
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:24,340
that stirs no hope for them so at the
only the only thing that really bothers

517
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:24,789
me when I

518
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:28,659
right learned about this this really
upset me this is that

519
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:32,309
when you install a local authority into
any browser

520
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:36,340
top pinning API's are all skipped look
at what happened with Logano

521
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,970
over Noel I'm gonna bleep over No Logano
allowed

522
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:44,080
one other advertising vendors to install
like adware types offer on them

523
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,100
seen you know you know tellin HP they've
all done this to some degree it on a

524
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,080
shame Logano

525
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,929
but that but what they allowed this
advertiser to do is rarely install

526
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:58,519
a local authority in the user's browser
in local machines before they sent it to

527
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,740
the customers who bought it

528
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,679
then in Robert Graham was able to
extract the key from this package

529
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,010
which lets him and the Middle easily any
Logano user

530
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:12,250
the point that what got me here was is
that anytime Google made a choice to not

531
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:12,950
accept

532
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:17,700
local attackers under threat model for
chrome and I'm like but wait a second

533
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,840
anyone get a local authority in a
browser

534
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,789
that means the company command builder
employees to modular software thou

535
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:24,510
telling them

536
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,970
that means that out you know any kind of
software kit installed

537
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,889
let's let's let's the pinning API be
evaded I wanna know when I'm p

538
00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:35,110
on my paintings being invaded even to a
local authority in Google Ste

539
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,450
decides to squash that and their excuse
was it's not part of our threat model

540
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,250
we can never stop a local attacker but
they consciously will

541
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,750
code in their browser to specify

542
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,760
that a local authority completely obeyed
pinning

543
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,639
this is to allow security software to be
installed on people's machines

544
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:56,679
and empty monitor all 30 let's
connections

545
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,210
without any kind of interruption without
any kind of notification to the user

546
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,710
I think this is a big deal this is
really upsetting thing that's happening

547
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,980
I think we should change this but it's
not an easy issue right I have a section

548
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,220
here on revocation

549
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,370
with extensive notes this is from Casio
goldsmith who wrote this section so

550
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,320
if you're interested in proper
revocation life cycle or doesn't violate

551
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,809
privacy that's not

552
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:22,440
using us are revocation list which
doesn't scale

553
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,870
this is a really good series of slides
did not sir in here in detail when I

554
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,980
release the slides go for I'm not to
talk about it

555
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,090
less snow before we finish up stop using
old say first we just saw this in large

556
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:32,610
and like

557
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,720
anybody here using expert no using
export ciphers in their website

558
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,870
consciously absolutely not this is a
28-year-old

559
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:43,880
issue so when you're using an old
Seifert is a bigger problem though

560
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,460
if you're using old Seifert while are
safer key exchange

561
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:52,169
the problem there is that as an attacker
I from a passive attacker

562
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:55,820
recording traffic all day long it might
be hard for me to break that crypt of

563
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,429
others

564
00:31:56,429 --> 00:32:00,539
as a as a threat agent on his record
that traffic for a long time

565
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:04,480
and eventually try to break the private
key steal the private key in some way

566
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,119
if you did if using an old safer the
passive attacker

567
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:11,320
who records traffic and somehow get your
private key

568
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,690
candy crypt all traffic that server ever
encrypt it

569
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,230
as a that's how nation states like to go
after people to some degree

570
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,730
enter perfect forward secrecy ciphers
these are things like

571
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:25,379
elliptical curve diffie-hellman which is
not liable to log jam type stuff by the

572
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:25,669
way

573
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:29,070
these are things key exchange algorithms
that they create

574
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:33,309
temporary symmetric keys that are not
derived from your private keys in any

575
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:33,769
way

576
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:37,820
that if it acker cracks tacky they get a
small part of the message after Greek

577
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,330
again to get another key

578
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,740
this is to stop again passive attacks
were who

579
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,600
pop your key from the Crypt in
previously recorded traffic

580
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,730
now as someone from are super Phyllis
told me was that the franc from should

581
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,919
fill stoli's like the private key

582
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:56,049
still need to be protected because I can
still your private key

583
00:32:56,049 --> 00:33:00,090
I would not be able to drive all your
previous record a trapper Creek that

584
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:03,029
particularly smack in the middle you if
I have a copy of your private key so we

585
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:04,619
still must protect the private key

586
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:07,879
preferrably in HS Mr or something strong

587
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:11,360
here's an example love up

588
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,440
here's an example have different Akhtar
configurations ciphers within TLS

589
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,779
that provide the fort secrecy is usually
elliptical curve diffie-hellman or

590
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:19,320
similar

591
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,639
will no longer using plain I'm our essay
for key exchange the Arab arce is pretty

592
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:24,299
much over

593
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:28,119
it's time to pretty much stop using it
everywhere again we have the key

594
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:30,980
exchange algorithm me about the location
algorithm we have the authentication

595
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,590
algorithm

596
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,669
we have a different modes and lengthened
I'm short on time

597
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:39,340
but in short we should prefer political
curve diffie-hellman

598
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,309
for key exchange authentication we
should be using AES today still there's

599
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:44,909
nothing better out there that I know of

600
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:48,240
shot to the six are better for macking
ex-senator so

601
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,690
I think this is pretty well known at
this point the time to retire

602
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,139
rhea our essay is now Google to Google
is going to start

603
00:33:55,139 --> 00:33:59,350
up strongly adding graphics when you're
using our

604
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:03,419
our essay in your in your in your
keychain very soon they have a pat they

605
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:03,879
have a

606
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:08,200
a plan to do this we're done call to
action

607
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,639
use truck transport secure make step 1:
do

608
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,810
HTTPS a strong Transport Security
everywhere

609
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,780
set-ups truck transport security and
make sure you're doing the pre the

610
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,470
initiative in the browsers as well

611
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,980
pin the search everywhere you can detect
when when you're given a fake

612
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,440
certificate to man the milieu

613
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,950
and make sure using forward secrecy
ciphers for everything you're doing

614
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:32,540
to stop passing attackers there's
another section on on

615
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,060
OS EP this is our a revocation life
cycle that's in the deck please read it

616
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,440
and move away from RC four in our essay
this is the basic

617
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,700
plan for TLS an HTTPS so much has been
improved

618
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,730
the work has been done by Google browser
vendors

619
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,919
script %ah her first huge amount of work
to get us where we are today

620
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:54,220
guess what now it's your turn let's get
HPS right

621
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:58,109
it's a basic foundation to secure
software thank you very much we're done

622
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:08,769
have a great day everyone

623
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:10,670
one question any questions go for

624
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:16,380
questions questions often a question
please

625
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,650
no your gonna artwork by police

626
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:37,440
breaking into your network installing a
simple piece of malware in your network

627
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,240
here is usually a trivial task for
dedicated acker

628
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,430
that's the issue stock in effect outside

629
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:47,579
looking up looking at your site but
Jordan you to go back to 1972

630
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:52,319
the original white papers on information
security saltar intro to from MIT and

631
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:52,970
they said

632
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:56,569
as a main tenant all the information
security you never

633
00:35:56,569 --> 00:36:00,250
trust the infrastructure that you're on
were in the air a

634
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,509
HTTPS everywhere or one piece of malware

635
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:08,539
1995 is good undermine all plain text
data going throughout your company

636
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:12,420
we should have our internal networks
everywhere

637
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,500
over HTTPS and almond academic is easy
for me to say that

638
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,410
you to do the actual hard work by so

639
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:27,089
I they were questioned for good have a
great day thank you so much tears

640
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:28,319
an up-close another plus
