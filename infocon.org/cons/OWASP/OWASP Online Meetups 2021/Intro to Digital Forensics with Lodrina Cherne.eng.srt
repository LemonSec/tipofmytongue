yes the one

136
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,800
mainly the 101 logo uh was because of

144
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,320
uh the the you know the the freeway

145
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,199
it's also our intention you know we're

146
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,840

150
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,080
or are interested and all that you know

151
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,360
try to come up with

152
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520

155
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,600
uh the the the thing the the zero or

156
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,000
in the log or the three the five dots

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,039

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,199
so i feel like i've been welcomed back

173
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,160
home and

174
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,360
thank you for having me

175
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,160
what i'm going to do today is i'm going

176
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,039
to share a little bit about myself

177
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,039
what i do in forensics what i do for

178
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,080
work

179
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,280
uh we'll talk careers in the field

180
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
but uh i'll leave plenty of time for

181
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,639
questions for everybody uh at the end

182
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,000
so i'll share first of all i'll

183
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
officially introduce myself

184
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,039
my name is ludrina cherny i i work at

185
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,000
cyber reason

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,599
that's the owl on the right uh we do

187
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,800
endpoint detection and response edr and

188
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,400
endpoint protection epp

189
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,520
so we're really a company who's uh

190
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,759
based here in boston where i'm coming in

191
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,199
from today

192
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,000
and we really try and just protect

193
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,440
people everywhere

194
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
and that's our mission is to protect

195
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,080
people in the open and connected world

196
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,199
but i was also sharing with our host who

197
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,080
knows that i

198
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,759
teach for sans institute so sans has a

199
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,000
wide variety of classes for people

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,080
who are in the field or getting into the

201
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
field of cyber security

202
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,199
whether it's defense and blue team or

203
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,000
offensive operations

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,240
ethical hacking pen testing that kind of

205
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,360
thing

206
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,199
you can take week-long classes in a

207
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,759
number of different subjects or even

208
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,280
earn your master's degree through sans

209
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
uh but i'm also doing a couple other

210
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,560
projects

211
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,599
including working in policy

212
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,759
so i should say what i do for some

213
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,120
reason is i sit

214
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,360
in our office of the cso i work on

215
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,160
policy

216
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,280
and standards and uh basically trying to

217
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
make the cyber security world

218
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,800
a better place so you can reach me

219
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
on twitter that's my name on twitter is

220
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,440
at hexplates i'll have this information

221
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,279
up at the end including my email

222
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,760
if you want to reach out to me but

223
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,919
without further ado i want to dive right

224
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,958
into it

225
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,880
an introduction to digital forensics

226
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,160
so what is digital forensics or i might

227
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,839
call this

228
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,640
dfir dfir stands for digital forensics

229
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,200
and instant response

230
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
and digital forensics is a branch of

231
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,399
forensic science

232
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
and it deals with identification

233
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,760
preservation

234
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,440
analysis and reporting of digital

235
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
evidence

236
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,640
so now if you are

237
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
new to this world and you're maybe a

238
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,680
crime show

239
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,720
junkie like me um you might think of

240
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,760
forensics as

241
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,000
when they go into the big secure room

242
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,240
and they zoom and enhance things

243
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,240
on a screen well forensics is definitely

244
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,600
more than that

245
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,640
um and think digital

246
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,040
forensics so anything digital whether

247
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,959
it's a computer

248
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,120
or host-based forensics that's what i

249
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
specialize in

250
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,959
you can also obtain digital evidence

251
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,959
from cell phones from networks

252
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,200
from the cloud from connected vehicles

253
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,360
you know the list really really goes on

254
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
and on and uh there's

255
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,839
really more places you can specialize

256
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,839
every day

257
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,680
it's worth noting that the field is

258
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,959
still fairly

259
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,080
young um there's a really seminal report

260
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,000
that came out just over 10 years ago

261
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,399
called

262
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,320
strengthening forensic science in the

263
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,920
united states

264
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
um this came out from the national

265
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,800
academy of sciences and talked about

266
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,120
all kinds of different forensics they

267
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
talked about blood splatter

268
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,240
ballistics dental forensics but it

269
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
really talked about computers

270
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
and multimedia forensics as a field that

271
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,680
relative to all those other fields

272
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,560
which honestly are fairly new themselves

273
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,680
in the grand scheme of science

274
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,480
computers as one that is still really

275
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,399
evolving and changing

276
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,560
and yet to be fully defined

277
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,000
and that's what i find exciting

278
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,480
so because i know this is supposed to be

279
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
a 101 talk

280
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,200
i talk about getting started a talk for

281
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,720
beginners

282
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,839
uh while i can't teach you to do digital

283
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,839
forensics in half an hour

284
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,200
i can teach you to identify on the

285
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,120
computers you use

286
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,839
on your cell phone when there might be

287
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,120
data

288
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,360
that can be recovered by a professional

289
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,720
like me

290
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,079
so i'm going to give you a couple

291
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,240
examples to think about

292
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,320
and as we go through these examples you

293
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
might start to see a pattern

294
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
of things you'll recognize on your

295
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,920
computer

296
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,600
on your cell phone things that indicate

297
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,680
there's data being left behind that a

298
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,920
professional like me could come back in

299
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,519
and recover so

300
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,560
let's start with this one which is an

301
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
example of

302
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,600
microsoft office and microsoft word

303
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,120
so something that i use a lot in my work

304
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,279
which by the way when i'm doing my

305
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,440
forensic investigations

306
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,240
um i spent a decade looking into

307
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,720
intellectual property theft

308
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
so for example somebody would leave a

309
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,839
corporation

310
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,120
go to a competitor um

311
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,600
and suddenly if they were a salesperson

312
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,480
all of their clients might follow them

313
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
or if they were an engineer they might

314
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,800
start developing a very similar

315
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,399
tool at their new engineering company

316
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,720
and because things are looking a little

317
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,600
funny

318
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,480
i'll often be hired to say can you look

319
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,399
at this former employee's computer i

320
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,440
think

321
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,040
something strange happened i think they

322
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,000
took some data with them when they left

323
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,320
and one of the things i'll look at are

324
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,480
documents that they recently used

325
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,600
recently opened so

326
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,639
here's one way that you can understand

327
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,440
how i can come to recover that data

328
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,680
so when you open microsoft word if

329
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,200
you're a word user

330
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
and you have it set up with your default

331
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,720
options

332
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,160
you might see something like what's on

333
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,519
my screen where word will prompt you

334
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,160
to open some of your most recently open

335
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,800
files

336
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,360
it might say you opened this earlier

337
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,800
today

338
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,000
from this location do you want to open

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,480
it again

340
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,279
this should be your clue that this

341
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,160
information is being tracked

342
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,880
now for those of you who are familiar

343
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,360
with this

344
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,240
already i'll try and give you a few

345
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,760
nuggets of information

346
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,880
about where this forensic artifact lives

347
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,279
so if this is all new to you stick with

348
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,639
the example i just gave you there are

349
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,639
going to be many more

350
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,480
if this is familiar to you you're

351
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,399
comfortable maybe you've done a little

352
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,680
bit of forensics

353
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,240
hopefully i can share with you that this

354
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,519
information is stored

355
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,800
in the nt user.dot registry file so in

356
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,720
this database that is so crucial to the

357
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
way our windows computers work if we're

358
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,839
talking about windows

359
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,920
however it's also stored in other places

360
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,279
as well so again i'll stick with windows

361
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,720
for now

362
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,639
if you're a windows user and you go to

363
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,160
your taskbar

364
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,079
on the side of your screen and you right

365
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,199
click it

366
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,279
that's another place you can see your

367
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,800
recent files

368
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,920
pop up and those are stored in a

369
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,600
different place

370
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,839
those are stored in an artifact called

371
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,199
jump lists

372
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,120
and those have a relationship to

373
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,720
shortcuts

374
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,839
or link files or dot lnk files

375
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,839
i'll use those terms interchangeably

376
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,320
sometimes

377
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,720
and you know office is really just a

378
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,800
wealth of information because when you

379
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,240
use office

380
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,920
you might see something like the button

381
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,000
i've just put up on my screen that says

382
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,720
recover

383
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,760
unsaved documents

384
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,519
okay recover unsaved documents

385
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,000
as an option in this application is a

386
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,320
pretty good indicator

387
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,480
that this application is saving things

388
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,839
even without you

389
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,120
saying i want to save them even without

390
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,560
intending to do it so when you start to

391
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,720
see these things

392
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,399
think there's something under the hood

393
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,720
maybe in a location that i as a user

394
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,320
can't readily access but there's

395
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,880
something

396
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,079
under the hood that's tracking my

397
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,920
information so let's

398
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,680
go on to our additional examples

399
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,279
downloaded files now somebody was asking

400
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,000
a question about malware and files are

401
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,800
safe or not

402
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,839
right when we started the session

403
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,680
what i have on my screen is a word

404
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,600
document with a yellow banner across the

405
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,360
top it says be careful

406
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,959
files from the internet can contain

407
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,040
viruses

408
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,279
and do you want to enable editing do you

409
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,560
want to stay in protected view

410
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,519
so you might have seen this before

411
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,120
and if you think about when you've seen

412
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,199
it

413
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,959
when you've opened a file with this

414
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,399
banner i am

415
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,519
willing to bet that you never did

416
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,040
anything to that file

417
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,040
that says uh classifies it and says oh

418
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,519
this came from the internet i better

419
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,800
treat it in a safe way

420
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,480
no your computer is doing this for you

421
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,519
and you'll see this on macs you know you

422
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,800
might not be able to run

423
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,040
certain applications because of where it

424
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,720
came from

425
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,759
so how does your computer know that this

426
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,639
document

427
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,160
came from the internet well

428
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
there's this little piece of information

429
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,440
called an alternate

430
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,560
data stream zone identifier or ads

431
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,240
zone identifier and it gets added to a

432
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,120
file when it's

433
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,279
downloaded from the internet usually by

434
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,839
your web browser

435
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,240
by the way if your forensic examiner

436
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,480
certain web browsers will also include

437
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,360
the url

438
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,560
that the file was downloaded from so

439
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,160
if you are downloading something from

440
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,480
gmail and i want to come in after the

441
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,280
fact

442
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,720
i see something's been downloaded from

443
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,319
the internet i wonder where you got it

444
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,679
from

445
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,760
there's a good chance that i'll be able

446
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,520
to go into this ads

447
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,880
zone identifier and see that it came

448
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,240
from the internet

449
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,400
and then the url it was downloaded from

450
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,199
including that it came from gmail

451
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,480
or whatever the site was

452
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,799
so i've got a whole lot more

453
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,160
examples to share with you

454
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,280
but this is my favorite one to share

455
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,840
i'm going to see if i can open up the

456
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,320
chat

457
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,600
here so i'm going to ask you

458
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
what everybody thinks about this in just

459
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,080
a moment

460
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,200
okay would it surprise you

461
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,919
to know that incognito browsing or in

462
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,760
private browsing

463
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,919
leave some traces of the websites you've

464
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,039
been on your computer

465
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,679
so this can be across different browsers

466
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,200
whether it's chrome

467
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,720
edge firefox

468
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,960
but we're talking today about

469
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,000
identifying

470
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,799
forensic data so i want everybody to

471
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,760
take a minute

472
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,000
take a look at my screen take a look at

473
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
that browser window

474
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,080
i highlighted in red it's an in private

475
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,840
browser window but there is something

476
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,000
else on this page

477
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,640
if you look really closely that might

478
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,360
tell you

479
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,360
that your history is being tracked

480
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,240
so i'll give everybody a minute i've got

481
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,240
the chat open if anybody has any guesses

482
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,039
and just take a good look at that screen

483
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,879
how do you know your data is being

484
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
tracked

485
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,559
all right i have one guest i have two

486
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,039
guesses

487
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,840
i i have to say

488
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
thank you folks who are responding so

489
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,320
far

490
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,440
by the way a couple of you are correct

491
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,559
okay i'll share it with everybody else

492
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,400
so on my screen and you might have to

493
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,039
know

494
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,600
this is how this browser works that

495
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
these are darkened that they're not

496
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,840
grayed out

497
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,520
excellent job in the chat couple people

498
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,039
call this out

499
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,760
the mere fact that i can go backwards

500
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,520
and forwards

501
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,919
in this session not just back but also

502
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,840
forwards

503
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,240
this tells me that within this tab

504
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,080
within this window

505
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,840
i've gone to a whole bunch of different

506
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,520
websites before this one

507
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,480
after this one and the mere fact that i

508
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
can go forward and back

509
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,840
and see what those websites are means

510
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,919
that something is being tracked at some

511
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,240
level

512
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,840
and because something is being tracked

513
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,280
at some level means

514
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,440
that if you are a professional like me

515
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,840
there is some

516
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,760
chance of getting that information back

517
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,039
i have to say it's tricky but there is a

518
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,280
chance

519
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,559
so well done everyone

520
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,880
okay folder opening is another big one

521
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,840
here

522
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,640
so on my screen i've got two different

523
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,880
kinds of folders open one is a list of

524
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,240
files

525
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,720
and one are small icons

526
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,600
so if you are somebody like me who maybe

527
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,400
wants to see

528
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,880
my downloads or my documents folder as a

529
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,120
list of files

530
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,960
and then i want to go into my photos

531
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,360
folder get all my vacation photos

532
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,679
and see them as a preview of tiny icons

533
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,320
once i set that setting to be the way i

534
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,840
want it to be

535
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,320
every time i go back to that folder

536
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,520
that's what the setting is going to be

537
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,080
so this should be your indication that

538
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,919
there is something being tracked and by

539
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,840
the way that something

540
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,159
on windows is an artifact called shell

541
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,000
bags

542
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,280
so shell bags is kind of a funny word

543
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,640
and

544
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,679
it's uh an artifact that i use all the

545
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,080
time

546
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,840
remember think about my intellectual

547
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,840
property theft investigations

548
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,760
what folders was somebody and what

549
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,000
folders did they know about

550
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,840
did they know to go on to the company

551
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,840
sharepoint and look in the folder

552
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,799
confidential classified documents

553
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,000
so this is something that is incredibly

554
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,880
valuable for me

555
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,760
um you know we're all about learning

556
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,720
here

557
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,760
so i am going to take a detour

558
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,720
for just two or three minutes and share

559
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,559
with you something a little bit outside

560
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,919
of forensics but i think something

561
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:10,400
that's

562
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,440
important to many of us here

563
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,640
um you know we are all here as infosec

564
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,159
professionals or people who

565
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,520
want to get into the field and we

566
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,159
have the virtue of being able to do that

567
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,559
by those who come before us

568
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,679
so in honor of that in my examples

569
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,679
you've seen so far and particularly on

570
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,280
this page i've included

571
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,720
some women of computing uh women who've

572
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,159
been instrumental in the history of

573
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,200
computing

574
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,000
in the development of cryptography and

575
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,559
security

576
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,280
and if you have a moment and are

577
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,960
interested in finding out more about

578
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,280
these incredible women take a screenshot

579
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,159
take a picture

580
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,760
of this screen and look them up

581
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,480
in fact there's one woman in particular

582
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,640
that i want to call out and i'm going to

583
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,679
share a little bit of her story with you

584
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,400
and that would be becky bass

585
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,200
who uh passed away four years ago

586
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,400
actually march

587
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,760
four years ago so this is the

588
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,559
anniversary of her passing

589
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,240
um i want to share a little bit with

590
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,640
everybody about becky bass because

591
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,360
uh we're recording this at a time uh

592
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,799
content warning i will say

593
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,760
one sentence about this and then move on

594
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,240
uh we're recording this at a time march

595
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,159
2021 we've just experienced

596
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,360
and seen incredible violence in atlanta

597
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,559
georgia

598
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,640
against people of asian heritage

599
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,000
and that is one reason in particular

600
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,720
i thought it was really important to

601
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,480
highlight becky's story

602
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,919
so let me tell you a little bit about

603
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,279
her rebecca gurley bass

604
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,799
was known as the dead mother of

605
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,480
intrusion detection

606
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,440
she was also known as info mom she was

607
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,640
born in alabama so she was a u.s citizen

608
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,720
of japanese heritage her mom was

609
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
japanese

610
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,960
and when she went to college in 1973 she

611
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,000
was the only

612
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,799
woman at her university of alabama at

613
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,600
birmingham program in engineering

614
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,960
only one she later

615
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,039
went on in her professional career to

616
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,960
work for xerox

617
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,000
and xerox's main headquarters is just up

618
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,240
the road from many of you in palo alto

619
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,200
so um i believe she was at xerox park

620
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,520
before she went on to the nsa

621
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,720
in the national computer security center

622
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,799
there she was particularly able to

623
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,880
advocate for women and minorities

624
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,159
in her work and she was also

625
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,480
technically very excellent she was

626
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,400
received the nsa distinguished

627
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,520
leadership award during her time there

628
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,080
she later went on to be the deputy

629
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,600
security officer at los

630
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,480
alamos national lab she was a venture

631
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,679
capitalist

632
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,000
later in life and she also wrote a

633
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,159
number of books that are seminal to the

634
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,919
field including the title intrusion

635
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,200
detection

636
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,760
and she co-wrote a guide to forensic

637
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,480
testimony

638
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,880
she was later credited with building the

639
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,919
fbi's first

640
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,279
computer crime squad but more than

641
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,679
anything else she is remembered fondly

642
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,720
as somebody who

643
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,840
cared about people

644
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,840
and in my doing research about becky's

645
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,559
life

646
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,679
to share that with you all there were a

647
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,000
number

648
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,720
of quotes that stood out to me about her

649
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,480
work

650
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,679
so i wanted to put one up on the screen

651
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,919
and i will also share that her legacy

652
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:52,720
lives on

653
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,480
at basesecurity.org

654
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,080
so you can check out bace security.org

655
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
to learn more about her work and her

656
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,559
legacy

657
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,080
okay so i'd like to thank everybody

658
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,159
for allowing me to share that story

659
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,320
and i think hopefully that's that's why

660
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,240
i'm here and hopefully that's why you're

661
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,960
here is

662
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,240
to hear some stories to learn something

663
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,600
so i'll try to pivot back to technical

664
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,240
information

665
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,640
all right and i'm going to jump back in

666
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,520
somewhat

667
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,600
where we left off remember i was talking

668
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,520
about folder previews and getting

669
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,080
information

670
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,840
from folders you've been in well

671
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,600
when we create these little file

672
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,360
previews these little icons

673
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,840
these are things that are stored on your

674
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,159
system

675
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,559
they're stored in an artifact on windows

676
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,400
called it's either the thumb cache

677
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,600
or the thumbs.db file

678
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,440
mac os has a very comparable artifact

679
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,799
to this as well

680
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,440
but you should have some indication

681
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,559
especially if you've been using

682
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,600
computers for

683
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,360
years and years uh think about

684
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,520
downloading photos from your vacation or

685
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,960
having a giant

686
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,480
folder full of lots of photos

687
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
and maybe you're opening that folder for

688
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,279
the first time

689
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,200
the first time you do that it takes

690
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,039
quite a while for all of those little

691
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,640
icons to be generated

692
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,159
especially when you think about back of

693
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,000
the day when our computers were slower

694
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,080
than they are now

695
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,919
but then every other time you go into

696
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,279
that folder it loads

697
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,080
a little bit faster certainly much

698
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,559
faster than the first time

699
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,960
so that should be your hint yourself you

700
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,840
should be thinking

701
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
okay there's something here that's being

702
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,200
cached

703
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,919
something that's being saved and by the

704
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,919
way even if

705
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,559
you see i called this folder very

706
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,640
cheekily i called it delete this folder

707
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,200
even if i delete that folder

708
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,960
i try and remove the files from my hard

709
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,320
drive

710
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,279
somewhere on disk i should still be able

711
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:11,919
to get

712
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,080
these little icons these little photos

713
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,840
back in my analysis

714
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,480
now i'll go into a few more technical

715
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,320
artifacts

716
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,360
one is from the system usage panel

717
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,320
when you uh control alt delete you bring

718
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:32,640
up

719
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,919
your task manager on windows

720
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,039
the mere fact that we can delete

721
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,240
our usage history how many cpu cycles

722
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,840
how many bytes have been pushed over the

723
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,600
network

724
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,840
the mere fact that we can delete this

725
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,880
information means that it's being stored

726
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,640
usually for 30 days it can be up to 60.

727
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,120
on disk in an artifact called the system

728
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,678
resource utilization management database

729
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
so i'm getting into some more advanced

730
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,640
artifacts here

731
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
but you might be thinking to yourself

732
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,399
and you might even be able to identify

733
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,520
now

734
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,440
when we had our time change just

735
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,720
recently

736
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,080
that your computer knew to change its

737
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,120
clock

738
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,480
and if you're paying attention to your

739
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,880
clock that there is something about your

740
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,720
computer that's tracking your location

741
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,480
this might lead you to believe okay

742
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,840
there are date and time

743
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,360
settings that know where i am

744
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,240
and figure out what my time zone is so

745
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,120
somewhere

746
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,679
that's being stored that i for example

747
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,360
am in eastern time

748
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,760
right now

749
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,159
been mentioning max throughout this

750
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,480
but now i'll give everybody on a mac an

751
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,840
example that's just for you

752
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,520
if in your house or in your office

753
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,440
you share thumb drives between a mac

754
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,480
computer and a windows computer

755
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,520
if you start at the mac then you go over

756
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,880
to windows

757
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,880
you might see something like this

758
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,480
files that begin with dot something

759
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,159
and ds store is a big one

760
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,320
these are all kinds of indexing files

761
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,600
that your mac

762
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,640
is doing just behind the scenes

763
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,679
tracking the files tracking

764
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,320
what volumes tracking all kinds of

765
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,960
things

766
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,000
on your mac again to be

767
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,159
more user-friendly that's why windows is

768
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,399
doing everything that windows is doing

769
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,919
it's trying to be user-friendly it's

770
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,520
trying to speed up our user experience

771
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,840
but by the way because macs and windows

772
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,600
see things slightly differently on our

773
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,840
file systems

774
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,080
when you plug that hard drive into a

775
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,760
windows computer

776
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,679
you kind of see these auxiliary

777
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,919
macintosh files that are doing all this

778
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,840
background tracking

779
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,440
but let's go on to phones now

780
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,159
so i have a fairly unique name i have

781
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,840
never met another lodrina

782
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,039
out there and every time i get a new

783
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:19,519
phone

784
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,640
i type in my name i spell it out and i

785
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,360
have to teach my phone no

786
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,519
my name is not spelled incorrectly i

787
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,519
want you to remember this get rid of the

788
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,799
red squiggly line

789
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,360
once i tell my phone that then it knows

790
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,720
what to do from then on

791
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,320
remember that my name is my name so

792
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
this should be your clue if you've had

793
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,399
to spell something unique or something

794
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,320
that's not in your dictionary

795
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,120
that there is a dictionary on your

796
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,679
mobile phone

797
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,200
and not only a dictionary there's

798
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,880
predictive text

799
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,519
oftentimes so your phone will try and

800
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,760
identify what word you want next because

801
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,080
it's

802
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,240
tracking what words you use in sequence

803
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,120
as you're typing out words sometimes

804
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,159
because it tracks that order

805
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,760
i can go back in and perhaps

806
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,799
perhaps see what words you typed in what

807
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,679
order

808
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,960
and as you see on the screen that can

809
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,919
not look good depending on what you've

810
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,159
been doing on your phone

811
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,840
typically by the time i get there it's

812
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,080
because something not good is happening

813
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,159
so those

814
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,320
were all of the examples i had to share

815
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,000
today

816
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,840
i know that we're going to pivot into

817
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,039
career

818
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,200
questions in a few minutes and questions

819
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,880
about this content

820
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,440
but for those of you who think this all

821
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,360
sounds really interesting

822
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,159
i love crime scene shows i love

823
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,039
mysteries

824
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,519
i love digging into all the different

825
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,080
settings on my computer

826
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,880
um if you want to work in the digital

827
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,039
forensic field

828
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,720
here's a few things that you will want

829
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,559
to remember

830
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,559
first about all the examples i've shared

831
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,480
today if it's remembered for you

832
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,760
it can be recovered

833
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,919
um what i'm sharing next these next

834
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,000
few slides these are things that i took

835
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,519
screenshots of to remind

836
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,279
myself to look up because every time

837
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,440
our systems upgrade there's no

838
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,640
corresponding book

839
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,679
or map pamphlet or manual

840
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,000
that is here's the latest version of

841
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,840
windows and what it means for forensic

842
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,919
examiners

843
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,159
you need to be aware of what features

844
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,000
exist so you can try and recover the

845
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,880
data that's associated with them

846
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,039
so when i see that sticky notes is

847
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,240
upgrading

848
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,399
and it can sync across devices i'm

849
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,960
wondering where that data is stored

850
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,799
sit on disk listen to the cloud

851
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,799
and again we're back to when office is

852
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,599
saving information for us

853
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,359
so it's remembered for you it can be

854
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,119
recovered

855
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,960
and if you want to work in the field

856
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,040
it's really this scientific

857
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,239
process that's important to you

858
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,000
so if you had science in middle school

859
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,079
or in high school

860
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,639
and you learned the scientific method

861
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,280
you know

862
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,199
observing what's going on coming up with

863
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,839
a hypothesis

864
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,319
test

865
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,000
and then share your findings maybe your

866
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,599
test doesn't come out the way you want

867
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,480
it

868
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,599
go back and do something like else

869
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,240
do it again

870
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,480
so these are really going to be your

871
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:56,879
most

872
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,760
crucial skills going into the field that

873
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,400
and your curiosity will take you very

874
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,280
very very far

875
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,160
i do want to talk about careers in

876
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,480
digital forensics

877
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,520
but how about this let me

878
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,320
pause first i'll stop sharing my screen

879
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,880
for a minute

880
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,599
and that way i can better bring up the

881
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,880
chat window

882
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,200
and see what questions you all have

883
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,079
about forensic data

884
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,920
so i'm going to scroll back up through

885
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,760
the chat right now and see

886
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,880
what questions i can identify but

887
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,640
if you had a question earlier or if

888
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,240
you've been holding a question about

889
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,160
forensics until now

890
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,720
uh please put it in the chat so that i

891
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,240
can see it

892
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,959
and we can get your questions addressed

893
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,760
okay and i saw a question earlier i

894
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,640
think this

895
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,839
um probably had to do

896
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,839
when i was talking with incognito

897
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:06,960
browsing data

898
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,400
somebody asked what companies are doing

899
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,800
this

900
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,760
who's tracking your information when

901
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,400
you're in an in private session

902
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,320
so this is something that everybody here

903
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,160
can test out you don't even have to be

904
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,599
on a computer you can

905
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,560
use your smartphone to do it if you open

906
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,440
up an incognito session

907
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,280
you can see that for every tab you're in

908
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,400
you go forward 10 websites you go back

909
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
if you click the back arrow go forward

910
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,000
again

911
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,160
well you know that somewhere there's at

912
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,839
least 10 websites

913
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,560
that are tracked now there's a bunch of

914
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
disclaimers and in fact they pop up

915
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,480
usually when you open that first

916
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,760
in private or incognito window you know

917
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,720
um if somebody's monitoring your traffic

918
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,320
on the network

919
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,079
if somebody has additional software

920
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,160
that's monitoring websites on your

921
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,520
system

922
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,079
yes that can be tracked but you as a

923
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,280
user

924
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,440
you as a user should be empowered to

925
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,880
know that that information

926
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,640
is there and you can do that just by

927
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,280
testing out different browsers

928
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,320
and then try this

929
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,839
open an in-private session

930
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,320
log into some site that you use like for

931
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,240
example me i'm a gmail user

932
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,400
now open another tab in that session

933
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,000
where i've got my gmail in one

934
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,720
and in a second tab i can still pull up

935
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,640
my google calendar i can pull up my

936
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,359
google drive

937
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,440
so this to me means that even across

938
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,040
tabs in a single in private session

939
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,200
i know that there's something in that

940
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,680
browser

941
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,680
not just in the tab but in that session

942
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,520
that is sharing my information that

943
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,480
cookies are shared with other tabs in

944
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,000
that session

945
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,280
so by the way this this might

946
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,720
mean different things for different

947
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,200
people you know if you are somebody

948
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,960
who is um in a really vulnerable

949
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,680
position

950
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,680
and you are trying to use a home

951
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,800
computer to look up

952
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,160
uh health information and you really

953
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,800
cannot

954
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,000
risk you know on on your life anybody

955
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,079
else on your home computer

956
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,599
knowing that you looked up that health

957
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,599
information

958
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,640
you know that's a different risk model

959
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,560
and that's a different threat model than

960
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,400
you're at work

961
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,640
and you want to know if your employer

962
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,720
can track your incognito browser

963
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,240
shopping

964
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,359
activity on your lunch break

965
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,520
so these are a couple things that you

966
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,359
can test out and try out and it'll mean

967
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,720
different things to different people

968
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,760
so all right i'm going back into the

969
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,000
chat and i'm checking out a bunch of

970
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,760
questions have come in

971
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,280
thank you all for the questions

972
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,960
uh let's see so

973
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,200
there's a question about forensics

974
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
outside of federal work and government

975
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,079
work

976
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,079
um i'll share with you that

977
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,880
i have worked uh really just in pr in

978
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,000
the private sector

979
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,520
i've supported um federal

980
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,119
state local law enforcement

981
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,839
investigations at certain times

982
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,720
um but i have to say the field is

983
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,079
growing and there is

984
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,359
plenty of work across all of these

985
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,880
different varieties that i've talked

986
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,400
about

987
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,960
so far

988
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,680
let's see oh can i get

989
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,480
rid of cash information so all of the

990
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
information that i've shared with you

991
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,920
so far how can i get rid of that

992
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,200
okay this is a great question

993
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,119
so i'm going to say that i have

994
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,440
looked at computers or somebody has

995
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,760
downloaded programs to try and cover

996
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,440
their tracks

997
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,599
uh some kind of evidence eliminator

998
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,040
evidence killer

999
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,400
they've all got great names i'm going to

1000
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,440
share with you that

1001
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,400
very few of them are effective at

1002
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,599
covering up

1003
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,280
all of these tracks that i'm sharing

1004
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,359
with you today

1005
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,880
and uh maybe that should be

1006
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,560
your takeaway for those of you who don't

1007
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,160
want to work in the field those of you

1008
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,760
who are wondering how does this affect

1009
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,359
me

1010
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,400
it is very very

1011
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,960
very hard to remove all of this

1012
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,400
information from your system

1013
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,960
i would say knowing that information

1014
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,000
depending on what you're doing would you

1015
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,280
be comfortable

1016
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,720
with somebody coming in and recovering

1017
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
it

1018
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,119
and are they likely to

1019
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,160
if it's your home computer and uh

1020
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,119
kids trying to cover up their activity

1021
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:13,920
versus

1022
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,280
me coming in and working um

1023
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,839
you know a million dollar data theft

1024
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,680
there are probably different resources

1025
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,280
that are going to be tasked with

1026
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,520
investigating those

1027
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,720
so hopefully that helps

1028
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,760
okay i see a few more about forensic

1029
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,520
information

1030
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,720
uh reporting on information

1031
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,680
who is best to open up this discussion

1032
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,680
and examples

1033
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,119
um there are many forensics communities

1034
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,520
online there are websites like forensic

1035
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,160
focus

1036
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,000
i'll put this in the chat in the bottom

1037
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,440
here so

1038
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,520
um there's a website called

1039
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,680
forensicfocus.com for example

1040
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,160
that has a good uh bulletin board

1041
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,160
discussion board

1042
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,680
i'm gonna share for those of you who

1043
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,440
aren't on twitter

1044
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,359
twitter is probably the most

1045
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,040
up-to-date thriving both beginner and

1046
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,920
advanced community online that i know of

1047
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,960
and if you use the hashtag defer so

1048
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,720
hashtag i'll put this in our chat

1049
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,119
hashtag dfir that will connect you with

1050
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,119
a lot of people who are talking about

1051
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:31,920
reporting

1052
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,599
talking about artifacts and different

1053
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,920
things

1054
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:41,359
so let's see there's a couple career

1055
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,839
questions i'm going to come back to you

1056
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,560
and i see another one about artifacts

1057
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,119
let's see

1058
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,079
if digital forensics is being used in a

1059
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,000
criminal investigation what type of

1060
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,079
evidence can be seen from the data

1061
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,720
microsoft collects with windows 10

1062
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,079
telemetry

1063
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,599
assuming the user had it to the lowest

1064
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,119
setting excellent question

1065
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,560
really good question so

1066
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,280
let me talk a little bit about microsoft

1067
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,480
and data collection

1068
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,520
and i'll reiterate again why microsoft

1069
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,400
is collecting what it does

1070
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,960
so microsoft is really collecting what

1071
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,319
it does

1072
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,480
to really give you a good user

1073
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
experience

1074
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,599
so um every system and i see a question

1075
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:33,920
about

1076
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,960
linux in there as well uh even

1077
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,119
questions about tor somebody just asked

1078
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,200
every operating system every program

1079
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,440
you know even tor that's an application

1080
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,240
very focused on user privacy

1081
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,400
still wants to be user friendly

1082
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,240
so that's why microsoft and mac os

1083
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,599
and your phones are collecting

1084
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,240
information about you

1085
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,440
and even if you used windows 10

1086
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,119
on the most um let's say non-cloud way

1087
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,160
possible

1088
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,000
non-connected to the internet kind of

1089
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,240
way

1090
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,640
a lot of the files and settings i talked

1091
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,599
about

1092
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,680
they really cannot be disabled they're

1093
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,240
there for diagnostic purposes

1094
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,079
and while you can minimize the amount of

1095
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,160
information that's being stored

1096
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,680
but to try and turn off all of those

1097
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,560
features would

1098
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,560
render your computer unusable

1099
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,000
so you know there are some things you

1100
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,720
can do

1101
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,240
like um i know somebody's going to ask

1102
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,920
if you did something like a linux

1103
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,680
buddhist to run your os

1104
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,079
great option there are lots of people in

1105
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,720
privacy and security who use that

1106
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,839
so um depending on your level of

1107
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:56,720
paranoia

1108
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,520
depending on the level of effort you

1109
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,240
want to go

1110
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,839
to to cover up your information

1111
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,680
would say you know it depends on your

1112
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,359
comfort level and again your threat

1113
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,598
level

1114
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,280
good questions thank you

1115
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,720
okay as we are live i want to

1116
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,359
acknowledge we're at the top of the hour

1117
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,760
uh i can stay for another 15 or so

1118
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,960
minutes so

1119
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,280
let's spend the next 15 minutes talking

1120
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,319
about career information

1121
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:35,200
so i can share my screen again

1122
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,800
okay

1123
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,319
and uh i'll start with sharing a little

1124
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:48,880
bit

1125
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,240
about my story um i don't have any

1126
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,160
slides in particular

1127
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,640
prepared so how about this i'll leave it

1128
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,280
on my contact information

1129
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,359
so those of you who are interested can

1130
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,960
take down my information

1131
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,440
check out the places i am online if you

1132
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,839
have any questions

1133
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,040
but a little bit about my story is that

1134
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,480
as i mentioned earlier i grew up in the

1135
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,480
bay area i was there during the

1136
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,400
first.com boom

1137
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,560
and i was quite young working in the

1138
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,000
industry

1139
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,680
but uh you know i was never somebody who

1140
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,960
really felt comfortable

1141
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,440
going straight into the workforce after

1142
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,640
high school

1143
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,280
i knew that college was in my future i

1144
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,319
am a first

1145
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,599
generation college graduate i'm also a

1146
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,359
first generation high school

1147
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,680
graduate and we can go back a little bit

1148
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,040
more beyond that

1149
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,480
so if uh if any of you are in that

1150
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,680
position

1151
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,720
you know i i am there with you

1152
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,800
and very proud of it and hope that you

1153
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,040
are proud of yourselves as well

1154
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,440
um so as the child uh and daughter of

1155
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,079
immigrants

1156
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,760
it was always drilled into me that

1157
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,079
college is something that i would go to

1158
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,240
whatever i did with my career after that

1159
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,760
grade but i would get a college

1160
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,119
education

1161
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,359
so at the time i went to college it was

1162
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,119
computer science

1163
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,800
uh if you were interested in

1164
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,000
things that all things technical and

1165
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,800
my computer science career involved a

1166
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,480
lot of programming

1167
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,920
which i did not like did not enjoy

1168
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,839
uh my path through college involved a

1169
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,319
lot of math

1170
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,559
which i was a little bit interested in

1171
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,359
when we got to topics like cryptography

1172
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:38,880
but by the time i was done with my

1173
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,200
college career i knew that i didn't want

1174
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,040
to be a programmer

1175
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,119
and i effectively graduated even though

1176
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,960
my degree says computer science

1177
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,480
i have particularly graduated with a

1178
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,559
math degree

1179
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,359
and uh i spent some time i went to

1180
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,559
school in boston

1181
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,760
i'm still in boston to this day i was

1182
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,359
lucky enough to take advantage of some

1183
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,559
of the resources

1184
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,720
of higher education in the area i was

1185
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,200
able to pursue continuing education

1186
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,079
going to night school at places like

1187
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,040
harvard

1188
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,920
and northeastern i looked into things

1189
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,520
like technical writing

1190
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,800
i looked into and thought about teaching

1191
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,000
which as you know i'm now doing for

1192
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,040
sans so you can find my classes i teach

1193
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,280
at

1194
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,480
sans.org um

1195
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,119
but was really trying to figure out what

1196
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,200
me as somebody who was interested

1197
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,920
in security somebody who considered

1198
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,760
myself as somebody having the hacker

1199
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,839
mindset

1200
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:42,079
what do i do with myself if i didn't

1201
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,640
want to be a programmer

1202
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,440
so the security industry existed it was

1203
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,800
still fairly nascent

1204
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,480
and i was lucky enough to take a class

1205
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,400
at harvard's night school in security

1206
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,520
and technology policy and law which

1207
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,480
really interested me

1208
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,559
that class was taught by somebody who is

1209
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,040
a retired fbi agent

1210
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,680
and i feel very fortunate at this early

1211
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,280
stage in the computer industry in the

1212
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,480
forensic industry

1213
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,920
that i happened upon somebody who

1214
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,520
retired

1215
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,640
in the field of forensics so

1216
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,720
she really opened my eyes to what the

1217
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,400
field was

1218
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,839
and now the field of forensics is much

1219
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,920
wider you can get an undergraduate

1220
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,480
degree

1221
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,720
master's degree phd or certificate

1222
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,680
in forensics you can get lots of

1223
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,520
on-the-job training

1224
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,480
but then the field was still quite early

1225
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,040
and

1226
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,119
the only place in the area that was

1227
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,680
offering forensics classes was my local

1228
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,760
community college

1229
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,920
so i came out of my bachelor's degree

1230
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,520
program wandered around a bit

1231
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,680
started taking classes at my local

1232
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,880
community college

1233
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,000
and that's really what started my career

1234
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,839
and it was there that i met the people

1235
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,760
that i would go on to work for

1236
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,359
for the next decade and beyond

1237
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,200
so those of you who um

1238
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,440
have gone to school and don't work in

1239
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,760
your field or are looking to change or

1240
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,240
maybe

1241
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,520
never went to school uh hopefully this

1242
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,800
shows you there's

1243
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,960
lots of ways to get into the field

1244
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,640
whether we're talking forensics or we're

1245
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,640
talking security

1246
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,680
and you know lots of ways to pivot

1247
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,359
your career even beyond that

1248
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,800
so i hope hearing a little bit about

1249
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,680
my journey helps some of you who are

1250
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,119
thinking about this

1251
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,960
field or thinking about changing into

1252
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,440
fields and uh

1253
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,040
i'm going to go back to the chat i'm

1254
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,520
going to review some of the career

1255
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,079
questions

1256
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,839
i saw in there so

1257
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,400
let's see

1258
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,720
there's a question about what would be a

1259
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,960
good entry-level job for a college

1260
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,160
student in the forensics field

1261
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,400
great question um there is

1262
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,280
one issue that makes it really hard to

1263
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,000
get into the field which is

1264
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,640
forensics jobs might not always say

1265
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,280
digital forensics in them

1266
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,760
so this goes for your entry level

1267
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,960
college student

1268
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,319
career changer whoever you are you might

1269
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,559
find roles that say

1270
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,400
forensic analyst it might say

1271
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,000
security analyst might say media

1272
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,880
exploitation

1273
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,960
especially if you're looking at federal

1274
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,000
roles and contractor roles

1275
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,880
um the best thing i can tell you

1276
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,800
realistically looking for a job in the

1277
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,839
forensics field

1278
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,640
is i consider forensics and digital

1279
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,079
forensics and deeper

1280
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,880
as part of the defense side of cyber

1281
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,240
security

1282
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,520
and you might see roles or related jobs

1283
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,559
in um in defense

1284
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,000
or in blue team and anywhere that you

1285
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,960
can get your

1286
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,240
foot in the door to do any kind of

1287
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,520
security analyst

1288
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,000
work or forensics or um

1289
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,599
you know whether it's an entry-level job

1290
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,760
or an internship you're going to have to

1291
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,160
look at titles really carefully and look

1292
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,079
at descriptions

1293
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,480
but um getting familiar with some of

1294
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,240
some of the forensic websites that i've

1295
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,079
mentioned earlier will really help you

1296
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,400
out there

1297
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,319
so i i hope that answers the question

1298
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:45,599
there were a few about

1299
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,280
getting an entry-level job out of

1300
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,280
college or somebody who might want to

1301
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,079
join the field

1302
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,319
let's see oh somebody mentioned

1303
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,440
encase down below which is a forensics

1304
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,599
uh software platform let me take a

1305
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,079
little detour

1306
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,040
into forensics and getting a job now

1307
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,680
that i see the term encase

1308
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,520
one great hack to find career jobs

1309
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,920
is to find keywords that are often used

1310
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,000
in the field so sometimes employers will

1311
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,480
ask

1312
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,599
for do you know encase

1313
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,880
do you know magnet tools

1314
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,599
do you know tools from eric zimmerman do

1315
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:29,920
you

1316
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,119
have a sans gcfe certification

1317
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,559
which is the certification that my class

1318
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,720
is associated with now you don't

1319
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,960
necessarily need to have

1320
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,800
all of those skills but once you start

1321
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,119
identifying certain keywords

1322
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,640
that should help you out quite a bit

1323
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,680
okay and i think we're coming back to

1324
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,319
forensic data questions which is great

1325
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,640
as well

1326
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,800
okay oh and uh more about windows 10

1327
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,760
telemetry

1328
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,240
yeah so i'm going to share to the person

1329
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,040
who asked the question

1330
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,800
thank you for that question so when we

1331
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,000
talk about windows 10 telemetry

1332
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,440
um that is something that i try to set

1333
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,880
at a very low level on my systems

1334
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,640
so when you set up windows for the first

1335
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,720
time it will ask you to log in with a

1336
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,400
microsoft account a live account

1337
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,800
i try my best to avoid all of those

1338
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,319
settings as well

1339
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,359
and even though i never use cortana

1340
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,160
um it still somehow pops up on many of

1341
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,280
my systems

1342
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,960
and tries to get me to use voice

1343
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,400
commands

1344
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,319
uh let me think about this question a

1345
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:53,839
little bit more

1346
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,640
okay so the question that was asked

1347
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,559
about windows 10 telemetry

1348
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,160
i will share that i have not

1349
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,359
looked at windows 10 data stored in the

1350
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,880
cloud

1351
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,799
um that relates to telemetry

1352
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,960
specifically

1353
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,359
i will say there was some data i shared

1354
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:20,720
earlier about the scrum i think this is

1355
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,960
my most useful artifact i'll go back to

1356
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,960
it so i can talk a little bit more about

1357
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,040
it

1358
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,090
so the windows scrum

1359
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:32,559
[Music]

1360
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,960
is that database that comes up when you

1361
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,920
press control

1362
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,960
delete and you go to your task manager

1363
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,960
this one here this one

1364
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,400
is incredibly incredibly useful

1365
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,880
for finding very very granular

1366
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,400
information

1367
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,200
uh you can see as a user if you go into

1368
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,240
this

1369
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,599
and you can add additional columns

1370
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,359
over here on the right you can add

1371
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,720
additional

1372
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,680
information to your view like number of

1373
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,160
bytes

1374
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,359
being written to disk number of bytes

1375
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,559
sent um amount of data being pushed over

1376
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,720
the network

1377
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,200
so i'll share with you um there's one

1378
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,680
example i go through when i teach

1379
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,440
which is a user who tried to cover up

1380
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,280
his tracks

1381
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,440
tried to avoid any suspicion

1382
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,920
tried to tamper with evidence by

1383
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,680
changing date and time settings and

1384
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,319
doing all kinds of wacky things

1385
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,799
and in this lab that i teach we look at

1386
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:38,720
this artifact

1387
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,359
and we find an application that was

1388
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:42,319
installed

1389
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,839
a file sharing application that

1390
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,319
supposedly is no longer on disk that

1391
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,200
supposedly

1392
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,720
was never on disk the amount of

1393
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,799
traffic it sent over the network and

1394
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,880
based on some other artifacts associated

1395
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,920
with this

1396
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,400
where the person was sitting what wi-fi

1397
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,079
network they were using

1398
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,280
and where in the world they were

1399
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,839
so i find this from super super powerful

1400
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:14,160
because of the reasons i just shared

1401
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,520
we can see incredibly granular

1402
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,160
useful information and

1403
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,319
in my mind i consider this telemetry i

1404
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,520
don't know if it

1405
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,920
exactly fits the original intent of the

1406
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,440
question

1407
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,920
but uh this is the kind of low low low

1408
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,040
level stuff that

1409
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,079
even if you went and pressed delete and

1410
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,799
tried to clear this out

1411
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,119
could still be carved for could still be

1412
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,480
found in volume

1413
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,160
shadow copies and uh

1414
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,078
is really a gold mine

1415
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,680
so i i hope that that gives you a little

1416
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,720
bit

1417
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,598
more to chew on

1418
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:09,680
and let's see

1419
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,720
few other things here

1420
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,400
go into some more questions oh and one

1421
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,480
more clarification thank you telemetry

1422
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,480
sent back to microsoft

1423
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,119
um yeah i will in fact double down

1424
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,200
on my talking about the strum artifact

1425
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,000
because uh

1426
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,280
you do need to enable this setting it is

1427
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:31,920
very

1428
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,119
easy to enable accidentally but

1429
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,400
uh strum data can be sent to microsoft

1430
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,640
and we can find much more of it

1431
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,480
much more history related to it if

1432
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,480
that's enabled

1433
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,880
um let's see what else

1434
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,839
and depending on what you're thinking

1435
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:52,880
about

1436
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,040
there might be things that surprise you

1437
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,400
like um

1438
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,440
if you use spell check this is

1439
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,480
absolutely telemetry if you

1440
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,400
use spell check or grammar check

1441
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,520
in microsoft word even if it is word

1442
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,880
installed to your computer not

1443
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,000
run from the cloud microsoft word will

1444
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,319
be

1445
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,520
sending parts of your data and be

1446
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,440
sending telemetry

1447
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,839
to microsoft to be able to do your spell

1448
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:27,520
check and in particular grammar check

1449
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:33,040
let's see and one more question from

1450
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,400
somebody who's uh

1451
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,440
exploring the field um by the way i'm

1452
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,480
omitting names

1453
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,760
just uh for the sake of this recording

1454
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,520
uh just for everybody's privacy so uh

1455
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,640
that is why i am omitting names here as

1456
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,440
i read through

1457
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,200
questions so

1458
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,359
i think this might be the last or second

1459
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,280
to last question unless one more comes

1460
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,040
in

1461
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,200
so question several years ago when i

1462
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,760
explored this area i knew encase was the

1463
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,640
leading tool used by investigators

1464
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,559
so who are the leading tools today or

1465
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,680
leading companies

1466
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,200
great great question thank you um

1467
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,520
in case is still a big player in

1468
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,920
forensic suites

1469
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,720
so is magnet forensics so is a black bag

1470
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,640
so is ftk um

1471
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,599
everything that i'm naming off these are

1472
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:32,319
big

1473
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:36,000
sweets so when i say sweets i mean

1474
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,359
uh tools that ingest a lot of data

1475
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:42,720
and give you a good 30 000 foot view of

1476
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,759
a computer system

1477
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,119
now a lot of the things i've shared with

1478
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:50,960
you today

1479
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,079
are best investigated with

1480
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:54,839
purpose-specific

1481
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:58,319
tools so if you are looking at this

1482
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,799
run or you are looking at shortcuts or

1483
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,000
jump lists

1484
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,480
there is going to be a specific tool out

1485
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,200
there

1486
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,200
for that um and

1487
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,960
as another comment very very astutely

1488
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,119
noted in the chat um

1489
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,599
every big tool that gives you that 30

1490
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:18,960
000 foot view

1491
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,880
has its blind spots so we can go in with

1492
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,040
these specialized tools depending on

1493
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,880
what you're looking at

1494
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,680
and if you haven't looked at the field

1495
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,359
in quite a while i would stress

1496
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:34,400
tools from eric zimmerman eric zimmerman

1497
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,160
also teaches forensics for

1498
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,839
sams he teaches

1499
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,200
courses that are both more basic and

1500
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,240
more advanced

1501
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,640
than the one that i teach he's a former

1502
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,280
former fbi agent and investigator

1503
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,559
and now is lucky enough to

1504
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,079
now that he is outside of the fbi

1505
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:03,920
developing his tools for all of us to

1506
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:07,839
use

1507
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,480
okay so let me take one more last

1508
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,119
question

1509
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:13,599
since we're at a quarter past the hour

1510
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,520
of this session

1511
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,520
and thank you for for the one more

1512
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,799
question i just got in

1513
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:20,880
are there any beginner software programs

1514
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,039
or subjects to focus on for people who

1515
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:23,359
are

1516
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:24,880
just getting into the field and

1517
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,599
developing an interest

1518
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,640
good question so

1519
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,839
if you're just getting into the field

1520
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,000
reading about it following folks on

1521
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,960
twitter again

1522
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,240
hashtag dfir will lead you to a lot of

1523
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,559
those people

1524
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,520
uh that would be for reading and then

1525
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,039
you'll find a bunch of blogs off of

1526
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,039
there as well beginner software programs

1527
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,680
there are lots out there the eric

1528
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,359
zimmerman ones i mentioned

1529
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,359
there's a lot of blog posts and videos

1530
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:00,240
about um

1531
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,400
there's one other one that i want to

1532
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,119
mention which is

1533
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,280
not a specific software program but

1534
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,240
something you can do

1535
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,240
if you are following dfir blogs

1536
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,799
and maybe following dfir twitter maybe

1537
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,680
the hashtag on linkedin

1538
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,760
you might see opportunities for dfir

1539
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,559
capture the flags coming up

1540
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,480
so these might be uh something that says

1541
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,640
if you're not familiar with the term i'm

1542
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,520
going to

1543
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,720
type it into the chat ctfs or capture

1544
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,640
the flag

1545
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,839
so in the uh capture the flag

1546
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,480
type game

1547
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,280
there's often opportunities to

1548
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,160
get some sample evidence maybe some

1549
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,319
suggested tools

1550
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,319
and as part of this game as part of the

1551
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,240
ctf you'll be asked questions

1552
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,200
about the evidence and usually there's

1553
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,359
beginner level questions and maybe

1554
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:05,039
hints you can take to um

1555
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:07,200
to try and figure out and explore in a

1556
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,640
somewhat structured way

1557
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,640
so those of you who are just getting

1558
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,620
started um

1559
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:14,720
[Music]

1560
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,960
again i can't stress enough how much

1561
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,520
information is shared on twitter

1562
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,799
if you're not a social media person um

1563
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,039
you don't have to interact and chat with

1564
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:26,720
people i think would be your to your

1565
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,000
benefit if you do

1566
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,200
but you can just watch the hashtag watch

1567
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,720
it on linkedin

1568
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,000
and find blogs and people from there and

1569
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,319
uh somebody just shared a great site in

1570
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:39,039
the chat

1571
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,119
i think that's that's a good one for me

1572
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:42,319
to end on

1573
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:46,480
the site they shared is dfirdiva.com

1574
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,839
uh so she has a site for getting into

1575
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:50,799
dfir

1576
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,400
and that's a great place to start as

1577
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,839
well thank you for sharing that

1578
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,240

01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,480

01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:03,760
i'm

1608
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,240
already in the industry but you know i

1609
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,760
definitely learned something new

1610
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,240
and i'm pretty sure uh the others have

1611
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,039

1616
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,520

1617
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,440
session

1618
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,880

1619
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,680
and uh i hope all everybody everybody

1620
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,079
enjoyed

1621
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,559
it and this is amazing i'm a lot of

1622
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:35,280
information

1623
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,400
so digital forensics uh is so

1624
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,039
amazing in itself so there's a lot to

1625
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:41,599
cover

1626
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,520
but uh i think you you touched on the

1627
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,640
highlights so

1628
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,359
we appreciate that and um you know we're

1629
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:48,880
looking forward to

1630
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,799
maybe having a capture to flag latrina

1631
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,160
what do you think

1632
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,240
that would be something interesting to

1633
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,960
to you know to embark on i think

1634
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,039
that would open up the uh kind of

1635
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,480
people's eyes a little bit too

1636
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,640
i've used autopsy and some of the others

1637
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,160
but that's just

1638
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,680
scratching the surface because i know in

1639
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,200
mobile forensics it can get

1640
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,480
pretty interesting especially i um

1641
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,440
had an opportunity to go to uh drive

1642
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,240
savers of

1643
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,240
uh here in the bay area but nevado and

1644
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,640
they have a whole lab and they were

1645
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,000
talking about how they do mobile

1646
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,280
forensics and

1647
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,000
some of the cases were were quite uh you

1648
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,799
know

1649
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,559
mind-blowing because they had to recover

1650
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:28,079
from a phone that was like

1651
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,880
you know water damaged and basically the

1652
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,720
person tried to destroy evidence and

1653
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,119
some

1654
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,720
other stuff like that and they were

1655
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,400
actually able to recover some text

1656
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,920
messages which was

1657
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,079
uh very essential for a case that they

1658
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:42,079
were working on um

1659
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:44,400
but i wanted to you know personally say

1660
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,079
thanks for everybody coming out

1661
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,960
and uh truly enjoyed it again ladrina i

1662
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,039
i have heard you speak before so

1663
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,520
you know hearing you you know talk again

1664
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,160
about

1665
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,799
your passions and and uh sharing uh base

1666
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,559
security was was really

1667
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,960
that was the first time so thanks uh you

1668
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,240
know i i remember

1669
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,680
some of those little tidbits of history

1670
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,480
but we gotta emphasize how much history

1671
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,960
there is out there and this was uh a

1672
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,480
great opportunity for us to

1673
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,880
you know educate other people as well

1674
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,079
and um

1675
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,839
you know i'm gonna end it on the note of

1676
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,000
uh just hoping everybody's families are

1677
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,679
safe and and you're doing well but if

1678
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,359
you would love to uh

1679
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,520
to learn more about like ladrena said

1680
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,960
there's twitter

1681
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,238
all the handles um and i i do say

1682
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:29,679
you know it can get overwhelming but

1683
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,080
there's tons of discord channels as well

1684
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,158
and we we share some resources too on

1685
