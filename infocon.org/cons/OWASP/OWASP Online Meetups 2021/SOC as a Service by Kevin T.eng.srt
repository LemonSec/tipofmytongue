59
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,080
you know organization we are but a

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
little bit uh about my talk today it's

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,879
gonna be called uh obviously security

62
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,360
um sock as a service but

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
you know i did wanna introduce myself

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,680
and kind of go through and talk about um

65
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,440
let me get that out of the way

66
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,200
um you know a little bit introduce

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,599
myself so that everybody knows who i am

68
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,640
and

69
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,560
kind of that that uh

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,599
can be

71
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,000
um one of the things i like to introduce

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,840
to uh the community but i've been part

73
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,680
of this organization for a couple years

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,760
me and rod actually met

75
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,760
during rsa a couple years ago and

76
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,200
that being said you know i've been in it

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,799
you know industry for

78
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,280
probably pretty much over a decade and

79
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
wore many different hats

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,920
and kind of worked in the private and

81
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,200
public sector

82
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,720
and the good thing about it is i think

83
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,080
with it

84
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,040
you are integral to the organization

85
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
because you get to

86
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,280
you know not only interact with

87
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,000
various you know uh departments you know

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,480
from hr all the way you know to

89
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,319
facilities all the way back up to the

90
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,200
ceo the the stakeholders right you you

91
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
basically touch every part of the

92
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,799
organization so you know you know

93
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,959
without a doubt we're involved in

94
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,440
security you know is one of our you know

95
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,519
uh you know things that that come

96
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,680
i i think it comes with the role but you

97
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,919
know it's not you you're not in a sock

98
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,680
right but you you definitely have to be

99
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,919
aware in security and have a security

100
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,960
mindset in my opinion to be successful

101
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,199
uh you know as someone that's working in

102
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,240
a help desk or desktop support roles but

103
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
that being said

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,240
you know i i did start out

105
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,720
early in my career luckily working as a

106
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,120
contractor and um you know i did get a

107
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,400
chance to work with many different

108
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,759
organizations

109
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,080
until you know i started realizing that

110
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
you know all these companies they all

111
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,240
have you know different um types of you

112
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
know methods for their sock or their

113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,759
knock

114
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,000
you know and some of them are basically

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,479
on site and you can walk into a room and

116
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,800
and there's an actual department and but

117
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,520
then a lot of them are outsourced and in

118
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,440
you know in the last i'd say in the last

119
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,400
five

120
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,600
years i've started noticing that and um

121
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
it started to it started to dawn on me

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,759
that you know we're reaching a point now

123
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,199
with the internet of things and all

124
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,080
these different um types of you know

125
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,160
companies that are small medium-sized

126
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,919
businesses and and you know the big

127
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,400
players obviously the fortune 500s

128
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,880
there's 24 7 security operations centers

129
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,120
that are you know happening

130
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,360
you know to to monitor all these these

131
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,840
various um you know organizations and

132
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,000
how do they do it successfully how do

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,120
you monitor 20 or 30 or 40 or 50

134
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,639
organizations

135
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,360
and um or do they have an in-house

136
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,720
security team

137
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,039
you know and so that that kind of you

138
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,880
know is where this talk is going to come

139
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,840
into play but you know being that being

140
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,280
said i kind of wanted to just introduce

141
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,240
myself you know i do organize a lot of

142
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
uh the presenters for the you know

143
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
pacific hackers as well as i've attended

144
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,080
the conferences in the past and marco

145
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,720
and and rod are you know amazing people

146
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,039
and just to say this is a great

147
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,960
organization for people to learn about

148
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,199
how to get into cyber security and kind

149
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,639
of you know if they're interested in

150
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,479
learning and and we provide this for

151
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,000
free you know and that's something i

152
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,479
want to say that that's been one of the

153
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,639
things that has kept me in being

154
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,039
involved is but i feel like giving back

155
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,639
and being part of like the community

156
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,880
that's doing that to try to you know

157
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,360
you know get get people some sort of

158
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,520
like a you know a beginning a starting

159
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,840
point to to look into cyber security

160
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,360
roles so

161
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,120
that's that's mainly what i want to say

162
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,759
about myself also you know

163
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,479
i do obviously you know working and now

164
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,639
in infosec and and i did kind of start

165
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,520
in i.t and then i kind of pivoted

166
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
and like wearing many different hats i

167
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,120
think is great you know because then you

168
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
know in an organization because then

169
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
without a doubt you just get to see a

170
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,639
lot of different things and and being

171
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,560
out here in the bay area has just been a

172
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,360
great experience for me and overall my

173
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,560
career so

174
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,759
that being said i'm going to go ahead

175
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,440
and start with the

176
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,840
the security uh you know stock as a

177
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,680
service but i really want to talk about

178
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,240
it because i think the future is really

179
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,639
going to come down to organizations are

180
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,720
looking at it the market's shifting

181
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,319
right um

182
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,919
there's a lot of things happening with

183
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,000
companies and they're outsourced in a

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,319
lot of their infrastructure and and some

185
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,400
of the things that you know i i started

186
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,560
doing this research on this topic

187
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
and it just it was dawning on me i was

188
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,520
like there's a lot of companies out

189
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,039
there that are already doing this but we

190
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,360
don't really think about it as as soccer

191
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,080
as a service or providing you know a

192
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,240
service where you protect their you know

193
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,879
infrastructure 24 7. what's the what's

194
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,639
the mo what are the models like so i

195
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,800
started looking at the subscriptions and

196
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
some of the offerings and you'd be

197
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
surprised that a lot of the companies

198
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,199
are

199
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,960
you know already kind of exploring this

200
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,639
because they've they've also thought

201
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,319
about it too like there's there's you

202
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,080
know with the remote workforce and and

203
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,840
kind of with the with the situation when

204
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,319
with covid obviously people are you know

205
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,000
scattered across the globe right but

206
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,560
they're working in in these companies

207
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,479
but at the end of the day you still have

208
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,039
to have a sock right you still have to

209
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,120
have i.t you still have to have

210
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
different things to to protect your

211
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,639
environment so with that being said you

212
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,000
know it's a

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,479
a big thing for me to get into the the

214
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,879
build the build on this principle of

215
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,879
it's you know what is a sock you know

216
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,479
what it's let's start start with that

217
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,799
you know it's a 24 7 security operations

218
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,000
center so

219
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,760
and it's long been considered like an

220
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
essential part of an effective cyber

221
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
security strategy for an organization

222
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,640
you know and it supported you know asaka

223
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,120
supports both technology and people and

224
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
it introduces the capability to identify

225
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,000
investigate and resolve targeted cyber

226
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
threats that's that's pretty much what

227
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
what i would say you know kind of

228
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,480
encapsulates what's happening at the

229
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,080
level of a sock but we know there's

230
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,560
people there's you know

231
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
a lot of technology involved you know

232
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,880
there's a lot of vendors right

233
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,800
and you know without that being you know

234
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
with that being said without a doubt

235
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,120
that's important to understand you know

236
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,200
what types of things are happening in

237
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,560
the sock you know

238
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,440
um with an expanding uh attack surface

239
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,839
like i was saying with you know um some

240
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,440
of the things like uh you know with

241
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,080
alert fatigue and cyber skills shortage

242
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,399
this is why i'm bringing this up is that

243
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,560
you know the big thing is

244
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,480
you're looking at now a new um era for

245
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,839
cyber security people are are going now

246
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,480
and and creating their own tools and and

247
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,800
innovations behind

248
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,200
cyber security initiatives that they're

249
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,959
thinking about like instead of just

250
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,800
saying okay well the old model is you

251
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,399
got to go work for somebody

252
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,000
you're you're actually

253
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,160
you know uh specializing and you have

254
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,760
certain tools that you can bring to the

255
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,080
table and that's why you know i talk

256
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,600
about this whole thing about soccer as a

257
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,360
service you're you're basically looking

258
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,440
at yourself and saying hey what do i

259
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
have to offer am i a threat hunter

260
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,880
you know

261
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,519
or somebody who's a security analyst

262
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,399
what level in this particular you know

263
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,120
methodology can i see myself being able

264
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,880
to provide a service and that's

265
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
it could be even consulting compliance

266
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
regulatory it doesn't have to be you

267
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,320
know you're looking at alerts you know

268
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,880
because we know alert fatigue is part of

269
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,959
the one of the reasons why people you

270
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,560
know look at you know having that

271
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,120
outsource because with the sock you know

272
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,200
you know it's very much you're you're

273
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,360
having people at tier one and tier two

274
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,800
and there's a lot of high turnover and

275
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,560
burnout so those things can be

276
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
outsources what i'm saying and and

277
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,600
because of that

278
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,079
you know you you keep you know you you

279
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,000
keep thinking about retention and and

280
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,240
how to keep staffing and you know your

281
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,079
costs down that's where companies are

282
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,160
starting to look for you know other ways

283
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,120
to um to to deliver their services and

284
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,600
as far as you know to get security cyber

285
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,560
security um handled by an outsourced by

286
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,519
another entity and um you know with that

287
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,399
being said you know i do want to say you

288
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,320
know i do i don't want to get specific

289
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,000
about um different

290
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
vendors because you know i think it's

291
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,920
vendor i want to stay vendor neutral but

292
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,360
i know there there are a lot of

293
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,880
different vendors out there that that

294
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,800
definitely um adheres to this and

295
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,480
there's some that you know a lot of

296
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
companies using you and you know these

297
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,640
are super popular um with that being

298
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,519
said

299
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,399
let me go to the next one uh slide which

300
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,079
is basically depending on your type of

301
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,760
system or organization

302
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,200
um you know

303
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
a suck the sox process is maybe governed

304
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,640
by the compliance regulate regulations

305
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,920
uh such as hipaa or pci some of these um

306
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,760
security operations center is is

307
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,440
required you know to frequently audit

308
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,920
their system to ensure compliance

309
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
um you know and that's a big one and

310
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,800
when i say

311
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,399
again when i talk about stock as a

312
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,079
service some of these things that i'm

313
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,040
talking about as a within the sock team

314
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
you know that's that there's more um

315
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,920
opportunities for you to look at well

316
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,320
you know sometimes you you have to spend

317
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,720
so much money in terms of just to get

318
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,120
compliant and that and that can be you

319
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,399
know very very complex for a stay a

320
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,839
startup right

321
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,600
you're really just trying to get your

322
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,680
your company off the ground you know

323
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,600
that there's a lot of moving parts that

324
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,519
you got to just keep the money flowing

325
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,200
you know with that with with your with

326
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,279
your investors and the board and you

327
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,519
you're trying to work on other things

328
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,120
and so compliance and governance is

329
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,079
really

330
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,920
you know it's not something that you

331
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,240
think of um but you can you can look at

332
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,320
that as what if i just outsourced it

333
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,959
right what if i had that as part of the

334
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,040
offering right the subscription offering

335
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,519
for someone else to handle that and and

336
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,360
then you know not only does it protect

337
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
the sense of data you know

338
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,480
uh uh you know that that you have but

339
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,000
they can also you know shield you from

340
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,079
liability and reputation harm right

341
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,519
because if you're a small startup that's

342
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,279
one of the biggest things right you get

343
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,600
hacked before you can even get to go

344
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,240
public or just brand reputation damage

345
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,360
right so the the you know from from from

346
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,519
a legal standpoint at least you have

347
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,519
that sort of like taken care of and you

348
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,600
can work on building your company and

349
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,920
growing the team and you know making

350
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,320
sure that you know you can you can have

351
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,639
that roadmap uh and and of success

352
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,639
obviously to implementing and managing

353
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,399
your security tools with stock team you

354
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,240
rely on a suite of technology products

355
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,440
that help you manage and protect your

356
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,079
organization's security environment

357
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,240
you have all these things right with

358
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,000
with with sock as a service you don't

359
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,079
have to worry about that right those are

360
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,560
all done and you can just basically run

361
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,600
your company you know thinking about how

362
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,240
best can can we you know move forward

363
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,760
without you know some of these other

364
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,079
things that you might have to you know

365
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,800
spend a lot of time that your team is

366
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,880
going to be you know bogged down in a

367
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,639
lot of these road blocks because build

368
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,880
building a good staff

369
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,399
you know there's a lot of things

370
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,560
happening you know and and like i said

371
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,160
again you know you gotta look alert

372
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,399
fatigue and alert ranking and management

373
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,320
and then in a sock you have to juggle a

374
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,399
variety of emerging threats at any given

375
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,720
time so if you think about it you know

376
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,000
you might have people who are

377
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,399
specialized in one area but not another

378
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,760
you're going to spend so much time

379
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,440
trying to hire for people that you might

380
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,480
not have

381
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,320
that are that that they are they're very

382
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,560
specialized in one area and and not in

383
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,079
another and so keeping you know that and

384
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,399
and constantly worrying about it it

385
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,519
could be it could be something that

386
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,199
keeps keeps you up at night and stay as

387
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,399
a ceo right so you you want to try to

388
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,160
think about how can i how can we be more

389
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,240
efficient and and how can we streamline

390
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,760
some of these processes

391
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,480
um but my main thing is you know looking

392
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,560
at uh companies nowadays they're they're

393
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,160
now starting to look at that stuff and

394
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,480
and retention is a big one right but the

395
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,920
the one i want to point out is alert

396
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,760
ranking and management

397
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,399
how do you uh you know how do how does a

398
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,560
sock may juggle a variety of emerging

399
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,639
threats at any given time that's one of

400
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,959
our biggest concerns like you know um at

401
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,959
our company is that how do we how do we

402
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,120
know what's a false positive right do we

403
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,680
have the the the time and wherewithal to

404
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,120
sit down and look at everything

405
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,720
sometimes some of that stuff can be

406
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,120
outsourced i'm not saying every aspect

407
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,279
of the sock can be outsourced but you

408
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,880
can look at some of the like the data

409
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,279
loss prevention right space especially

410
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,199
if you're trying to be um you're looking

411
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,959
at compliance and governance especially

412
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,480
when we're looking at companies in

413
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,639
sensitive data and data governance

414
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,279
that's a huge one so if you have

415
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,519
companies that you know something that

416
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,600
can take take that away off your plate

417
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,199
and come and a company

418
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,600
um is growing you know you're trying to

419
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,759
you're trying to staff up right so

420
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,079
having a sock can be difficult too

421
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,160
because to tell you the truth most of

422
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,519
the times

423
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,720
you know when you look at a job

424
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,480
description and it says hey i need this

425
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,959
person they've got to know like 40 or 50

426
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,399
different technologies and you're like

427
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,000
oh come on really you know it's like

428
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,920
this is not written this is written from

429
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,079
an hr perspective not a hiring manager

430
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,079
perspective which is some of the reasons

431
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,480
why i say you know it could be good to

432
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,959
get you know someone that that that is

433
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,480
knowledgeable about some of these things

434
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,560
but you're probably not going to to me

435
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,880
going to hit every uh everything that

436
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,959
you want to get in and looking for a

437
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,639
candidate you might get close to some of

438
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,639
it but other than that you know that's

439
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,199
the main thing um what services does a

440
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,839
stock uh perform well gauging your

441
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,720
available i.t resources uh you know that

442
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,399
that's a big one

443
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,240
you know because even where i'm at right

444
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,480
now you know it's lean every every

445
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,399
company is thinking about how can we you

446
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,120
know cut down costs and if we're scaling

447
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,959
how can you know what other things can

448
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,759
we reduce to you know to maintain you

449
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,440
know our infrastructure to keep it safe

450
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,279
and secure but in order to protect your

451
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,560
various devices processes and

452
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,639
applications the sock must gain total

453
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,880
advantage over your organization's

454
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,720
environmental threat landscape and and

455
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,320
that's the big thing right to accomplish

456
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,399
this they must review

457
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,079
various service systems networks and

458
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,079
applications that stores processes

459
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,240
honestly uh being working that i've had

460
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,560
that experience working in it these

461
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,119
things it's hard right because you've

462
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,799
got to have a person that's dedicated to

463
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,119
that again that's why i'm saying stock

464
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,199
as a service is starting to look really

465
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,679
good for companies because you know

466
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,520
they're starting to think of you know

467
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,880
where we can

468
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,039
offset some of these things because it

469
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,799
is already busy keeping up you know with

470
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,599
the daily you know keeping access and

471
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,720
and and

472
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
making sure that they keep the house you

473
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,079
know lights on and so to speak and

474
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,000
keeping things up and running but it's

475
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,600
also about you know

476
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,679
looking at your disaster recovery plan

477
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,679
some of that other stuff you can kind of

478
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,200
look at some of these things to be

479
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,120
outsourced and and that's the that's the

480
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,200
bigger part i think as companies grow

481
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,320
too and they use a lot of these

482
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,799
cloud-based sas applications it starts

483
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,520
to become more more apparent to me um

484
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,679
you know just it's just it's just it's

485
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,600
easier you know to run your company and

486
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,760
think about okay it's outsourced we hope

487
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,080
that you know nothing would happen but

488
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,240
you know most of the time we we're

489
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,080
already you know kind of overwhelmed

490
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
with just a day-to-day so that's kind of

491
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,320
like why i touched i touched on some of

492
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,760
the things that i did

493
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,919
um also cost savings one of the first

494
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,360
reasons why an organization will work

495
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,720
with the stock is that it lowers the

496
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,120
total cost of ownership

497
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,960
and when you partnership with shop with

498
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,559
a sock you don't have to spend money

499
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,160
hiring internal

500
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,679
security analysts and purchasing

501
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,600
software or wasting valuable time or

502
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,039
make and make sure the security

503
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,640
environment solutions are working as

504
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,480
intended so that that's some of the

505
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,640
advantage access to advanced technology

506
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,880
skilled and experienced professionals it

507
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,640
you know and it simplifies the i.t

508
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,240
relationship you know because i think a

509
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
lot of things where i've noticed in

510
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,960
companies sometimes you'll see a

511
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,120
situation where they'll they'll think of

512
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,440
it as okay we have a security team but

513
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,919
then we have i.t and then it

514
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,160
and security you know have their own

515
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,880
version of what is security you know and

516
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,120
some of the things that fall in in the

517
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,080
line of say you have you know an agent

518
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,919
running on each person's machine and

519
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,720
then you know that person you know says

520
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,400
hey something's happening and you know

521
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,000
security reaches out and you have to

522
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,760
verify or say there's a brute force

523
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,600
attack or something like that you have

524
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,160
to verify it and and and if you're in a

525
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,840
position where you're already dealing

526
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,320
with so much it's already on your plate

527
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,880
and you don't have someone in that

528
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,240
security say

529
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,000
that can say hey you know that's a false

530
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,760
positive or whatever you're just wasting

531
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,600
time and i think that some of the things

532
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,480
i'm seeing too and and even in my role

533
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,400
i'm seeing like you know again false

534
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,640
positives alert fatigue so you're

535
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,320
chasing down a lot of things that and

536
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,080
then you find out oh it was just because

537
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,679
you know there's a lot of different

538
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,200
things happening and it could it

539
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
couldn't even be related to the to the

540
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,960
issue and at hand and the root cause

541
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,760
could be something completely different

542
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,600
also you know i think with the advance

543
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,440
access the advanced technologies part

544
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,080
for stock as a service there's a lot of

545
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,400
obvious offerings that your company you

546
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,760
may not have the ability to um you know

547
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,880
the

548
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,799
with the cost and overhead of

549
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,120
maintaining a specific tool

550
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,840
and you know if you think about it if

551
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,240
you have that as a subscription based

552
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,919
you can you can customize it and say hey

553
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,400
you know i only need to to know certain

554
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,679
you know these things that i want

555
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,320
protected but if you have an overall

556
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,880
um advantage in the sense of like you

557
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,720
can you can scale it down or scale it up

558
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,400
it's elastic right and the

559
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,320
subscription-based models depend on you

560
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,799
know what your slas are if you have p

561
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,000
zeros um all that can be determined but

562
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,480
you know you you you have an opportunity

563
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
like that to grow and and and your

564
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,640
company based upon some of that stuff

565
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,480
that that i talked about you can grow it

566
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,919
and customize it

567
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,240
also you know a high cost of

568
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,880
complexities and in-house cyber security

569
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,840
operations too much noise and um

570
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,600
an increasing complex cyber security

571
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,200
landscape is creating problems for

572
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,039
businesses of every size severe alert

573
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,600
and regulation fatigue vendor overload

574
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,919
and complex compliance issues with the

575
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,159
growing skills gap you know when i talk

576
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,440
about that

577
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,039
that's what i'm saying as you're as

578
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:01,840
you're

579
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,280
looking at it from a cyber security

580
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,600
professional what particular skill set

581
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,840
do i have where i can offer it as a

582
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,440
service and this is kind of where i'm

583
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,600
coming up with my own you know looking

584
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
at my career i'm like you know i'm doing

585
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,760
a lot of different things to assess

586
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,200
what's it going to look like in five or

587
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
ten years you know with the growing

588
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,039
landscape of cyber security because it's

589
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,799
only going to get more complicated as we

590
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,200
know and that's why i think that the

591
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,679
future is going to be somewhat like uh

592
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,679
you know this whole thing with sock as a

593
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,360
service because you know as we're

594
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,640
growing as as a iot landscape you're

595
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,080
thinking about all these billions of

596
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,240
people with with mobile devices it's

597
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,679
going to get more and more complex

598
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,000
especially when we're looking at um

599
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,240
people working from home and what's your

600
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,679
what's your home environment is it

601
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,240
secure so that's why i think if you have

602
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,799
someone else in a sock situation where

603
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,880
they can out you can outsource that they

604
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,400
can monitor your environment in real

605
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,760
time 24 7. it's it's harder for me to

606
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,280
think about okay i'm going to hire 20

607
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,520
people there's all these various people

608
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,679
in different aspects that are going to

609
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,080
you know monitor the environment

610
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,640
and have a you know like a you know a

611
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
full a real-time assessment of my

612
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,880
environment people gotta go on vacation

613
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,440
right people gonna are gonna maybe make

614
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,280
make mistakes but if you look at it from

615
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,880
a from a from a a larger standpoint

616
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,799
there's more room for mistakes when

617
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,480
people get tired right they and then

618
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,840
that's why we have the burnout in the

619
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,360
high turnover

620
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,520
which i think is is when you look at the

621
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,000
subscription based model they'll spread

622
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,440
it out amongst

623
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,280
their team right they can hire people

624
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,120
who are you know in different regions of

625
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,840
the world where it'll become much more

626
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,480
staggered where it's not just one thing

627
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,039
that you can have and and say you know

628
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,360
in a particular region but it's spread

629
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,039
out all over the world so

630
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,880
that's another aspect that i think is an

631
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,360
advantage um you know

632
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,640
you know the biggest thing about stock

633
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,559
as a service is you know these things

634
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,520
are obvious like prevents intrusion

635
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
detects and monitors cyber threats it

636
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,799
contains you know these are the things

637
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,520
that

638
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,280
you know you can look at that are that

639
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,720
are the benefits and the potential

640
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
business you know prioritize remediation

641
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,280
based on potential business impacts um

642
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,360
you know a lot of the companies that

643
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,640
that um you know are 24 7 365 right that

644
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,120
i'm talking about the fortune top 500

645
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,880
companies you know

646
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
the big players in silicon valley think

647
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,120
about it they have no downtime there is

648
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,360
no you know scheduled maintenance it's

649
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,919
it's constant go go go so with the with

650
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,320
the sock as a service model

651
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,080
you can have a staff

652
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,320
subscription so that you know your staff

653
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,480
is there it's the coverage is there it's

654
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,520
customizable it's based on the slas of

655
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,679
each uh company you know whatever

656
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,400
however you think about it it's based to

657
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,000
prioritize remediation based on

658
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
potential business impacts which is a

659
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,240
huge one which i think you know comes

660
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
down to how you want to look at your

661
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,640
subscription model with the uh you know

662
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,120
the whole thing but um

663
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,559
you know the size of the organization

664
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,640
benefits you know from from stock as a

665
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,480
service you know it's really going to

666
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,919
come down to

667
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,919
money you know it's subscription-based

668
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,080
model and and a lot of companies don't

669
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,039
they don't have the budgets uh the small

670
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,279
startups the smaller ones don't have it

671
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,960
so they like to think about it oh it's a

672
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,400
subscription base sure

673
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
it's kind of you know it's kind of um it

674
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,559
makes sense to me for you to get in

675
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,960
where you can and at least have some way

676
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,320
to protect your company and your

677
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,640
infrastructure versus you gotta compete

678
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,039
with the bigger companies right and get

679
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,120
and get completely um

680
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,760
inundated with the the cost that it

681
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,600
takes because a lot of the the bigger

682
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,240
players they obviously want to have

683
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,159
longer you know subscription models or

684
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,919
something like that for their services

685
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,279
and you don't even know if some of these

686
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,840
tools work you know and and i think

687
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,600
that's that's the big thing but i think

688
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,279
the first stage starts with an

689
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,960
assessment getting somebody to come in

690
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,120
and saying hey what is your environment

691
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,760
like what do we need to you know look at

692
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,039
and what are your crown jewels and

693
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,880
things like that so that you can kind of

694
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,400
start from the beginning and then and

695
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,240
then you can scale up but with this with

696
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,679
the sock as a service yeah you can

697
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,480
customize it it's scalable but it's also

698
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,000
you know micro and small businesses

699
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,039
because a lot of there's a lot of

700
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,679
startups you know especially in silicon

701
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,960
valley i mean every other day i'm

702
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,360
looking at there's a new company and so

703
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,279
i think the bigger part is

704
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,520
if you don't have an in-house um you

705
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,240
know

706
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,360
uh security you know uh model to say hey

707
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,200
or you don't even have a budget for it

708
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,799
you can at least come up with some of

709
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,880
that stuff um from the beginning and say

710
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,440
hey okay at least we got security you

711
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,159
know in some degree but it may not be

712
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,080
what we want but until we can get to

713
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
that point we can we can adjust you know

714
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,039
we can keep keep some things um in mind

715
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,039
when it comes to that uh security

716
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,400
mindset but you know another thing is um

717
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,840
handing off the securities

718
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,919
responsibility to the team of security

719
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,159
specialists that's the that's the big

720
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,840
benefit of it right and it's also when i

721
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,000
talked about the the benefits are going

722
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,880
to be around you know retention you know

723
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,279
um again with the you know it's a cyber

724
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,279
security skill shortage it means that

725
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,039
your organization struggle to attract

726
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,440
and retain skilled security personnel

727
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,279
and and i'll touch on that in a

728
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,200
different sense of think about it the

729
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,039
the people who are you know

730
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,440
highly sought out in this field they're

731
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,640
they're going to the highest bidder

732
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,919
that's just how it works right you're

733
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,720
getting i get even you know um

734
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,600
some people asking me hey you know

735
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,840
you know how how is it that this person

736
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,080
you know gets this job in that job and

737
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,240
i'm like you know because they're highly

738
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,880
skilled in a specific area and and

739
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,039
that's because you know they've been

740
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,880
working in that industry for so long and

741
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,600
everyone knows as your reputation grows

742
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,120
in this industry

743
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,720
you become super popular and then

744
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,480
companies look you up and you don't have

745
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,240
to worry about looking for work work's

746
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,480
looking for you so you know but you know

747
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,240
the bigger thing is when i talk about

748
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,080
stock as a service it's kind of like

749
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,679
that you kind of you kind of build your

750
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,679
own reputation as a security

751
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,080
professional and with it with that being

752
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
said that's kind of the reason why it's

753
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,000
hard for the skills the skills shortages

754
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,919
because there's a lot of the really

755
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,440
highly qualified folks are already

756
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,960
working or they're either being highly

757
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,480
sought out and they and they usually get

758
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,320
a lot more money if they go to a top

759
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,159
fortune 500 company we just know that

760
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,159
that's just the name you know the nature

761
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,399
of the of the the game the name of the

762
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,279
game but improved uh you know i think it

763
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,360
improves your security staffing because

764
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,279
if you can pay people well they they'll

765
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,279
stay around you know soccer's a service

766
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,640
also

767
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,320
you know adds on you know you get

768
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,799
security expertise and you get it around

769
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,720
the clock and you also get a dedicated

770
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,159
um you know uh person that can actually

771
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,000
work with you and you have a point of

772
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,200
contact and you know sometimes you get

773
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,640
people who are specialized in certain

774
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,559
areas like malware and analysts or

775
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,000
incident responders or something like

776
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,120
that

777
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,000
also the lord the lowers the total cost

778
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,600
of ownership

779
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,240
of deploying maintaining and operating a

780
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,320
complete stock in house can be expensive

781
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,240
and as you know that's some of the

782
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,080
reasons why i think you know a lot of

783
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,240
times it's the high turnover or if

784
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,080
there's a vulnerability or breach it's

785
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,000
because people they can't keep the

786
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,080
retention is hard you know and alert

787
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,600
fatigue and they're working in the sock

788
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,279
and they're just they don't they don't

789
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,679
realize you know how much staffing it

790
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,960
takes and then you know once you start

791
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,640
building a sock you're like oh this is

792
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,799
hard to keep coverage people are out

793
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,480
they're sick they're on leave whatever

794
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,960
right and and then you you look at you

795
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
know maybe this might be something that

796
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,200
might be ideal for us to to outsource

797
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,360
this so that you know we can at least

798
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,200
you know um you know think about the

799
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,559
things like i said staffing up and

800
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,640
you're growing your company uh build up

801
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,480
the solution and institutional knowledge

802
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,880
for a mature cyber security program is

803
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,799
an extended process it's an ongoing

804
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,240
thing so increase your security maturity

805
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,679
you know and keep up to date with

806
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,600
security and the latest tools to sock

807
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,000
tools so that's another benefit of sock

808
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,440
as a service

809
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,679
but the the other thing that i want to

810
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,480
touch on here um coming up on the on the

811
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,399
end of this talk is the challenges of

812
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,159
stock as a service

813
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,520
you know there there's many you know

814
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,399
benefits but outsourcing security is not

815
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,240
always a simple task some challenges

816
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,399
that organizations opt for managing

817
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,640
stock service asaka as a service

818
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,559
commonly encounter you know onboarding

819
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,360
processes is not as good as you know you

820
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,919
can you it's time consuming and

821
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:22,720
people

822
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,880
uh you know with that fact that you know

823
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,360
you leave yourself open to to

824
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,120
organizational vulnerability you know to

825
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,200
cyber cyber security threats during the

826
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
transition so like again if someone

827
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,039
leaves the organization and they're a

828
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,880
specific you know person that's highly

829
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,799
specialized in a certain role you'll

830
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,960
lose that person you know um also

831
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,600
enterprise data security you know um

832
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,520
that's that's a big thing right data

833
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,159
governance data security who you know

834
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,320
it's always been kind of with personal

835
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,080
information you know how to how do you

836
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,320
deal with that especially if you got

837
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,080
companies that are in various

838
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,240
territories there's various

839
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,399
governance and compliance like where is

840
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,399
the data at right if you're if you're a

841
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,159
company that is in the united states is

842
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,360
your data in asia and is it in europe

843
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,880
you know and so there's a lot of that

844
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,480
stuff that you got to kind of be aware

845
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,360
of and then the cost of log

846
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,440
like keeping logs and things like that

847
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,679
that can be you know a costly thing and

848
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,679
then you know looking at you know how

849
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,840
much money you're going to spend on just

850
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,039
you know because think about log

851
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,360
retention and you know keeping your logs

852
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,919
around for for to say governance and

853
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,840
compliance reasons where who's going to

854
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,360
store that so that could be another

855
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,200
issue and then you know the regulatory

856
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,440
landscape is is what we see now is

857
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,760
growing more complex and so you know you

858
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,440
have to you have to put up safeguards

859
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,840
for things like that and think about you

860
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,960
know how

861
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,679
you may um look at the regulatory aspect

862
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,840
of it so you know

863
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,520
if you're looking from from it from a

864
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,200
third party you know it's like what is

865
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,440
their um security posture like are they

866
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,360
compliant or they you know are they

867
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,039
certified and things like that to deal

868
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,880
with some of these issues so some of

869
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,039
these things may not be covered so you

870
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,200
so you may not cover all your bases so

871
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,960
you know my thing is to talk about kind

872
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,120
of like the future i think is security

873
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,519
um soft you know stock as a service

874
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,440
because i think in-house it's going to

875
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,679
become more we're remote workforce right

876
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,360
now so i think it's going to become more

877
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,880
and more common

878
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,039
for you to have um

879
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,799
people spread out all over the world and

880
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,279
you're gonna have you know outsourcing

881
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,919
this this service and you know there are

882
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,360
a lot of companies actually that are

883
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,760
doing this and and you know if you if

884
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,679
you really think about it most of the

885
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,600
companies that we use are doing this

886
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,960
anyway they just they're just not

887
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,799
broadcasting and saying hey this is this

888
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,039
is kind of how we look at it but it is

889
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,279
an added on subscription based model too

890
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,600
with some of these um very like like

891
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,919
container based like kubernetes type and

892
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,600
you know that kind of thing

893
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,840
and and what i'm saying is that's kind

894
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,200
of going to be the future especially

895
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,360
with the sas applications right they

896
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,440
have their own stock it's not in one

897
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,039
place it's very much

898
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,799
distributed equally throughout the globe

899
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,240
because their products are all over the

900
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,080
world so they have to have kind of like

901
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,320
stock as a service as an offering that

902
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,720
you pay for on top of you know already

903
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,760
their their um their product offering

904
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,480
so

905
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,120
that's pretty much all my my my talk is

906
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,039
going to cover um

907
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:20,000
and and i'm happy to take any questions

908
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,720
thank you for that awesome talk uh kevin

909
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,320
um

910
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,519
do you see

911
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,919
um

912
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,120
this model applied to big corpse or this

913
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,559
is simply

914
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,639
small and medium sized business

915
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,640
that's that's that's that's something

916
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,399
that i've thought about when i started

917
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,279
doing my research on kind of like

918
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,960
a lot of companies are already doing

919
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,679
this if you think about it um

920
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,120
aws

921
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,279
you know look at cloudflare it's it's

922
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,840
literally it's it's not just sock as a

923
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,679
service but it's security as a service

924
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,080
but there are other products baked on

925
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,519
that's why i wanted to stay vendor

926
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,519
neutral but if you think about it

927
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,039
um you know

928
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,200
most of the open dns you know all those

929
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,120
companies have some kind of subscription

930
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,799
based but but it's all around like at t

931
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,279
even has it you know um

932
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,080
soccer as a service so i think it's it's

933
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,240
this is becoming more of a

934
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,480
uh something where like if you're a

935
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,799
small medium enterprise business but if

936
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,519
you're at a large fortune 500 you're

937
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,200
probably they're probably already using

938
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,039
these because they're not going to have

939
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,880
to worry about okay we got to have a

940
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,519
staff in-house because now people are we

941
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,519
are actually going to return to office

942
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,679
you know is it actually going to happen

943
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,519
in the next couple of years maybe maybe

944
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,360
not but people have gotten used to

945
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,440
working remote and i think now

946
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,360
with the fact that you we know it can

947
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,799
work people are going to start to say

948
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,039
well why do we even need the overhead of

949
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,600
a building and an office and keeping you

950
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,080
know people to to have you know these

951
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,919
times when we can just have them working

952
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,240
remotely from wherever what region of

953
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
the world we want and we can pay them

954
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,720
based on that region's um cost of living

955
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,199
so think about if you got somebody

956
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,000
maybe in another part of the world where

957
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,918
they are happy to take you know the

958
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,560
salary that you would have somebody take

959
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,040
and and say texas you know versus where

960
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,359
they live they would happily gladly do

961
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,280
it and i think that's where i'm starting

962
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,359
to see the transition going because i

963
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,679
think that it's just a matter of talent

964
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,599
because there are people who are you

965
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,320
know who have that the skills that that

966
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,839
most companies are looking for but they

967
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,679
may not live in the us and they may be

968
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,760
around the world so now i think with

969
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
this with the soccer as a service it's

970
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,520
really going to come down to

971
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,399
that

972
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,399
particular thing about you know

973
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,000
the bigger companies are looking at at

974
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,960
it like it's a cost saving right and

975
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,119
where can i find somebody who's you know

976
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,960
got the the skills that we're looking

977
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,119
for but you know they're looking outside

978
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,040
the us i mean let's just be honest the

979
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,200
cost of living you know in the bay area

980
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,400
you can probably get

981
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,480
you know for one person's salary how

982
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,400
many people could you employ with that

983
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,880
in another place in the world so i think

984
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,880
the bigger companies are already using

985
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,240
it but they're just not they're not

986
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,119
saying

987
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,440
okay you know here's specifically

988
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,520
because i think with all the tools i

989
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,599
think that the the fact is

990
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,960
um

991
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,640
you know what i'm seeing in the

992
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,480
companies that i've experienced have

993
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,800
experience working in they all use some

994
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,400
sort of out outside um you know uh type

995
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,680
of solution

996
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,680
for phishing right for um the the

997
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,400
antivirus so i think all those those

998
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,800
those things are sort of like uh sort of

999
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,200
like sock as a service but it's not

1000
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,520
initially looked at as oh well the

1001
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,079
security operations center this whole

1002
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,440
you know um

1003
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
this whole thing is all about

1004
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,359
you know looking at it holistically from

1005
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,720
the organization's standpoint but

1006
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,960
they're using a lot of the solutions and

1007
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,760
all these various um you know um

1008
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,640
offerings are cloud-based and there's

1009
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,680
somewhere

1010
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,599
a place where people reside that are

1011
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,280
that are monitoring all these these

1012
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,880
different applications right and they're

1013
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,800
seeing hey there's something happening

1014
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,640
just like you know like like google

1015
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,880
workspace like how does that work right

1016
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,440
there they have their own uh sock right

1017
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,520
but is it in one physical building or is

1018
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,359
it spread out and distributed throughout

1019
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,760
the world so i mean i think i think

1020
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,839
that's the future but but but you know

1021
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,680
i'm seeing that i don't know if anybody

1022
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,040
else here is seeing that but that's what

1023
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,119
i'm seeing

1024
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,560
no can they

1025
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,520
can the

1026
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,880
msps take care of this or or do you see

1027
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,680
the msp simply as

1028
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,920
organizations sending like they have

1029
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,160
probably one guy that's looking at an

1030
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,839
automated

1031
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,680
service a crown job that sends emails

1032
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,000
saying hey you got this

1033
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,400
or are they truly taking care of it are

1034
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,119
they truly a suck

1035
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,280
i think that their problem is hybrid i

1036
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,280
think you know it comes down to cost i

1037
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,119
think with the subscription model i

1038
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,880
think you know you have to look at it

1039
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,119
like aws right you pay for that premium

1040
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,640
you're gonna get that you know what's

1041
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,640
their sla right that p0 um but it's all

1042
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,880
coming down to to me

1043
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,680
um

1044
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,640
how you look at the bigger picture

1045
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,960
companies want 24 7 network monitoring

1046
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,560
and surveillance real-time alerts and

1047
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,119
attack you know visualization so they're

1048
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,200
they're looking at it from you know

1049
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,000
how

1050
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,280
easy is it for us to you know um detect

1051
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,119
these these threats and in real time

1052
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,640
remediate against it and if you could

1053
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,079
outsource that

1054
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,320
i think that that to me speaks volumes

1055
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,800
because you're gonna you're gonna have

1056
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,520
ability to not just

1057
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,320
have you know um be re reactionary but

1058
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
proactive and i think the stock as a

1059
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,040
service they're gonna have a heads up on

1060
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,839
that

1061
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,640
um they're gonna see that they can offer

1062
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,040
it and they're gonna guarantee an sla or

1063
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,480
they're gonna you know you're gonna lose

1064
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,800
that customer but my point is they

1065
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,400
probably have deeper insight into the

1066
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,920
organization's network in order to

1067
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,440
identify and respond to potential

1068
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,280
threats that that's just what i would

1069
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,040
feel like you know because think about

1070
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,640
it like cloudflare like how are they

1071
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,359
able to remediate and and work their

1072
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,640
magic right

1073
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,960
as we know um they they have a lot of

1074
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,680
customers but you know that that again

1075
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,520
goes down to

1076
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,119
defense in depth i think you're gonna

1077
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,560
you're gonna look at probably what the

1078
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,280
sock as a service provider you know what

1079
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,800
what they're offering is based upon

1080
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,160
their their subscription you know

1081
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,560
because it's all gonna be layered on

1082
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,079
some of these tools that we're talking

1083
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,960
about and what they can you know promise

1084
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,240
based on on on their uh sla and you know

1085
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
but i think the higher the higher the

1086
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,160
cost obviously um

1087
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,359
you're going to probably i think it's

1088
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,040
going to fall down you know the cost is

1089
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,480
going to fall down on

1090
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,920
how much how much you think you can

1091
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,920
afford you know that that's what i think

1092
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,280
thank you

1093
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,440
anybody else have any questions

1094
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,640
i was just gonna add to what uh um brad

1095
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,240
was saying or was asking so the

1096
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,079
the way i see it sometimes because for

1097
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,160
example i i work in a

1098
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,320
mdr uh you know team right so manage

1099
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,400
detection and response right

1100
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,800
and you know we technically are not

1101
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,119
considered a sock as a service and

1102
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,280
here's a reason why and and that we're

1103
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,599
not considering mssp obviously because i

1104
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,599
you know i work for a secure company but

1105
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,520
there are some companies that has you

1106
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,119
know go through we go through they go

1107
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,240
through mssps and all they do is you

1108
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,960
know

1109
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,119
they they basically

1110
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,200
you know they're the middlemen between

1111
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,040
you know making sure that everything's

1112
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,359
up and running you know they they sell

1113
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,280
you hardware software and stuff like

1114
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,200
that but sometimes they don't do the

1115
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,160
actual work where a sock as a service

1116
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,839
and uh mdr

1117
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,079
um you know that's what they do mdr

1118
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,720
obviously is just more for detection and

1119
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,760
response where shock you know it's it's

1120
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,359
basically the whole nine yards you're

1121
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,599
talking compliance you're talking alert

1122
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,440
monitoring you're talking three hats

1123
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,280
you're talking insane response you're

1124
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,520
talking you know the whole thing

1125
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,599
and so that's why you know uh sometimes

1126
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,280
mssps are

1127
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,839
you know in my opinion and again

1128
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:16,960
you know

1129
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,319
everybody kind of has their own

1130
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,720
definition of what are mssps and the

1131
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,079
soccer services and what is mdr but you

1132
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,160
know basically in reality is that

1133
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,839
at least from what i've seen

1134
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,680
mssps are are kind of limited uh p

1135
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,240
companies tend to buy

1136
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,040
sock as a service or mdr solutions

1137
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,640
more than actual uh you know an mssp

1138
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,400
contract type of thing do that make

1139
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,520
sense

1140
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,359
yeah that makes sense i think you're

1141
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,960
right it's a you know you can you can

1142
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,040
also you know i didn't want to i don't i

1143
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
don't want to lean too hard on one or

1144
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,560
the other i think it depends on the

1145
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,960
needs of the business and also i look at

1146
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,920
it from

1147
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,800
a uh budgetary aspect right because

1148
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,720
we're talking about

1149
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,920
maybe it is

1150
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,359
you know wiser

1151
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,359
you know at this point in the company to

1152
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,920
outsource it based upon you know their

1153
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,560
um their their their uh you know how

1154
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,960
they're they're performing right um do

1155
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,359
they have the budget to hire a full time

1156
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,160
staff to monitor but again i'm i'm

1157
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,480
looking at it as um

1158
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,839
as we grow

1159
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,319
you know and and everything is we're

1160
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,319
looking at the landscape threats you

1161
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,359
know are

1162
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,119
are becoming more and more

1163
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,599
uh it's common that we need we need to

1164
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,000
staff up right well the cyber security

1165
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,240
skills gap that we're talking about some

1166
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,280
of that is inherent in the fact that you

1167
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,599
know we're human beings and and we do

1168
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,200
get tired and and exact uh is a point

1169
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,319
i'm saying

1170
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,400
two look at look at some of these

1171
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,560
subscription based it could be a hybrid

1172
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,000
it could you could have some people on

1173
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,319
on site that maybe do some things that

1174
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,319
you want to have in real time you want

1175
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,240
to have a person but then you also might

1176
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,400
want to do some some of it and customize

1177
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,440
it and i think i've looked at enough of

1178
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,760
of these offerings on and like you were

1179
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
saying it just depends on the needs of

1180
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,839
the business and the budget and and what

1181
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,920
they what they're looking to to protect

1182
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,440
right because some things you you're

1183
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,040
right with the compliance and governance

1184
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,800
and the data governance that's that's

1185
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,359
sticky that's a that's a that's a very

1186
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,960
sensitive subject because you want to

1187
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,040
make sure that you're you know and and

1188
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,200
then the log delivery and all the the

1189
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,440
retention of the data and or from

1190
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,200
compliance from a compliance standpoint

1191
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,960
some of this stuff is regionally

1192
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,400
distributed all over the world so you

1193
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,480
got to think about where is your stock

1194
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,040
where do your people you know um reside

1195
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,800
what country you know all those

1196
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,760
different things do do make a big

1197
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,400
impact on on you know kind of like what

1198
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,560
what you're looking to do in terms of

1199
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,720
you know um regulatory and compliant

1200
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,040
from a regulatory and compliance aspect

1201
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,680
but but you're right it's just it's kind

1202
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,520
of like i think what's interesting is

1203
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
that most companies

1204
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,079
have this kind of hybrid uh model

1205
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,000
but uh they won't really

1206
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,480
you know let let it be publicly known

1207
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,680
because they know that you know they

1208
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,880
want to make sure

1209
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,359
that that people are aware hey we got

1210
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,760
some kind of you know robust you know

1211
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,800
sock but it's not the traditional stock

1212
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,640
you know i think it's a hybrid you have

1213
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,560
some things that you would have in-house

1214
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,319
and some things you'd outsource

1215
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,640
and between the two hopefully you know

1216
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,240
it's defense and depth right you're

1217
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,880
hoping this you know see that you have

1218
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,000
the 24 7 coverage that you need 365 days

1219
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,240
a year and you have someone

1220
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:32,960
on

1221
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,200
you know on on a minutes notice that

1222
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,359
they can notify you and be proactive and

1223
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:38,960
look at that threat and say hey you know

1224
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,560
what this is what's happening and this

1225
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,160
is not a false positive if there's

1226
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,079
something you know ddos attack or

1227
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,319
something that that's happening and even

1228
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,400
outages you know i'm starting to notice

1229
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,880
like misconfigurations are bigger so if

1230
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,560
you can catch that kind of thing i think

1231
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,319
and be proactive i think you know it

1232
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,359
just depends on the needs of the

1233
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,119
business but that's just you know that's

1234
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,040
just from what i'm seeing and it's

1235
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,480
different from each organization in each

1236
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,119
organization

1237
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,839
any other questions

1238
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,640
i have one question kevin

1239
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,760
okay

1240
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,119
so how does uh on-prem versus uh on

1241
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,079
cloud

1242
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,920
you know come into the picture here for

1243
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,319
for stock as a service

1244
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,720
you know i think with without a doubt i

1245
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,200
think if if you have an on-prem

1246
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,079
infrastructure you need to in-house sock

1247
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,680
you know because you're going to have

1248
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,920
someone there with the it team to

1249
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,760
determine kind of

1250
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,599
what's happening in real time

1251
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,400
and

1252
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,359
being more of a sas like a cloud-based

1253
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,400
company

1254
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,480
you know there's nothing to protect

1255
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,560
in-house right like as far as like

1256
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,440
actual

1257
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,440
servers that are set up in a data center

1258
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,319
right

1259
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,839
um i think that

1260
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,160
you probably want to look at outsourcing

1261
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,240
some of that because if you think about

1262
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,280
it sas applications slack

1263
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,720
you know

1264
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,960
google workspace all those have their

1265
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,680
security already inherent

1266
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,079
um on top of what you already you know

1267
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,319
what your product and and what's being

1268
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,640
offered in in the product itself but you

1269
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,040
have to think about it um

1270
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,200
you know if you want to manage somebody

1271
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,119
to manage your infrastructure on-prem

1272
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,040
you probably i would say

1273
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,280
go with um you know someone that's an

1274
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,599
in-house provider because you you know

1275
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,760
like a build a actual have a team of

1276
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,920
people dedicated looking at you know

1277
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,240
your environment and knowing what your

1278
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,839
environment's doing because

1279
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,319
i i think it could be a hybrid model but

1280
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,319
i feel like you know it's more it's more

1281
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,920
it just makes more sense to me because

1282
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,280
i've had both

1283
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,440
and we never outsourced anything because

1284
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,680
it was it was like you know we got this

1285
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,839
this data center you know because that's

1286
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,280
one thing in itself right you got the

1287
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,040
data center and then you have the you

1288
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,760
know um you have your own in-house team

1289
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,240
that knows you know your tech stack

1290
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,160
and then if you outsource that if they

1291
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,400
don't really understand especially a lot

1292
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,319
of this um when you're looking at

1293
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,560
proprietary intellectual property like

1294
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,000
things that are

1295
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,599
you know if you have a leak or something

1296
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,520
or or something like that

1297
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,200
in in in that sense of the code or

1298
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,200
something like that it just damages

1299
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,359
you know not only you know before say

1300
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,520
that the product launches it's just you

1301
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,319
know irrecoverable damage so it's more

1302
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:29,839
in my mind to have we had an in-house uh

1303
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,079
you know we were the dedicated uh sock

1304
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,319
as a service you know and so to speak

1305
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,680
but you know

1306
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,680
i think they intermarry it too kind of

1307
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,599
like as a hybrid thing with the with the

1308
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,680
i.t department so you're kind of part of

1309
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,160
it um but i think that's that's how i

1310
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,480
would see the difference um but but i

1311
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,160
think you bring up a good point i think

1312
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,720
with smaller companies too to be honest

1313
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,480
this just makes sense right because it's

1314
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,240
small you're a small

1315
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,720
say you're um you know a mom paul shop

1316
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,480
you know and you just have you know a

1317
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,400
website that you just have things that

1318
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,280
you just want to know hey is is it is it

1319
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,599
okay that we're up and running 24 7 what

1320
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,599
can you offer me they don't have a lot

1321
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,839
of a lot of like like a huge amount they

1322
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,000
got you know personal data things of

1323
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,599
their customers

1324
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,920
there's a lot of stake but it's not the

1325
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,359
it's a big difference between that and

1326
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,079
say a fortune 500 could be like a bank

1327
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,160
like it just doesn't make sense to you

1328
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,240
know try to go all stock as a service

1329
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,160
especially with a bank you know and that

1330
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,400
that's where your on-prem legacy

1331
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,280
um um situation to me i've got some

1332
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,800
friends friends that work in the bank

1333
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,000
and they told me they're still using

1334
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,040
like

1335
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,040
you know some pretty pretty legacy

1336
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,359
systems and and that's why they need an

1337
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,119
in-house security they need in-house i.t

1338
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,119
some of the systems run on

1339
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,880
older infrastructure but i think the

1340
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,960
newer the companies that are emerging

1341
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,240
now those what i'm seeing like the

1342
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,319
startups they're all sas based cloud

1343
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,920
applications slack

1344
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,319
um you know google workspace

1345
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:57,599
and um

1346
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,760
using a lot of these to their advantage

1347
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,000
so that so there really is not much more

1348
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,640
than just you know as long as someone

1349
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,760
doesn't really you know um you know

1350
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,040
they don't have a vulnerability in one

1351
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,240
of those applications they're kind of

1352
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,160
okay but i mean there's still best

1353
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,000
practices and things like that

1354
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,160
you know that they need to follow with

1355
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,920
training of their employees and things

1356
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,599
like that

1357
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,440
okay okay that makes sense thanksgiving

1358
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,839
yeah and also i just want to add to what

1359
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,440
uh kevin just mentioned so

1360
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,880
this is really true

1361
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,119
obviously not all companies will require

1362
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,160
a you know mssp mdr or stock as a

1363
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,119
service

1364
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,240
uh

1365
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,720
merely the the companies that have like

1366
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,880
uh you know traditional networks and

1367
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,040
stuff like that who who will require

1368
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,440
someone on prem and you know and even

1369
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,520
even if they're moving to the cloud not

1370
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,720
everything's going to be in the cloud

1371
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,119
because there's a lot of things that are

1372
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,839
still going to be you know on-prem uh

1373
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,680
but you know uh

1374
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,839
startups for example they

1375
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,760
now there's a new thing and you probably

1376
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,880
everybody here about it called zero thro

1377
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,920
zero trust right so um which is

1378
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,079
basically what pretty much all the

1379
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,880
companies like uh kevin mentioned uh you

1380
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,440
know slack and salesforce and all those

1381
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,400
you know uh are implementing so the the

1382
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,520
requirement to have you know you know an

1383
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,319
actual stock might not be it

1384
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,559
but maybe all you need is account

1385
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,880
management maybe that's where they need

1386
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,520
the uh uh you know to focus on or that's

1387
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,280
where they need to do some type of uh

1388
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,160
monitoring but other than that you know

1389
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,839
you will not require but it really

1390
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,680
depends on the the size of the company

1391
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,079
for sure

1392
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,400
yeah and i my main reason for bringing

1393
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,359
this talk also is to talk about the um

1394
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,760
you know the the the thing about the

1395
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,359
future right we want to see what's it

1396
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,440
gonna look like five ten years from now

1397
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,599
are we gonna have in-house uh you know

1398
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,920
uh like an actual sock or knock and all

1399
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,520
that because you think about if it's all

1400
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,000
cloud-based and it's all you know in in

1401
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,839
in the so-called you know

1402
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,319
in in this uh environment we where we

1403
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,559
have all these iot devices

1404
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,280
even if you have a stock and hire folks

1405
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,240
that are specialized in in various

1406
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,920
degrees of

1407
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,000
knowledge of you know cyber security

1408
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,920
there's so many devices out there now

1409
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,520
and people are bringing

1410
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,520
that into your environment and and you

1411
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,200
kind of have to think about it are you

1412
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,960
going to have a person that specializes

1413
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,200
in each of those different various you

1414
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,480
know um types of iot devices and then

1415
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,880
you start getting into you know how

1416
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,680
would you even look at the threats and

1417
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,640
and

1418
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,559
even keeping up with that stuff so it's

1419
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,000
going to get overwhelming and i think

1420
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,680
there's going to be a lot to a lot of

1421
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,359
noise and i think

1422
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,760
if you it depends on the organization's

1423
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,359
needs but i think if you're a small

1424
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,040
startup you're focused on the product

1425
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,280
getting getting it to launch or

1426
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,520
you're focused on something to get you

1427
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,920
you know to ipo or wherever you need to

1428
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,319
be you know and to be successful right

1429
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,680
but if you're worried about your

1430
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,520
constant day and night up staying up

1431
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,839
thinking about security cyber security

1432
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,400
is always on everyone's mind and

1433
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,720
it definitely you know

1434
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,720
when i say that on everybody's mind and

1435
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,800
in the bigger picture when it comes to

1436
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,640
you know brand reputation and there's

1437
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,400
there's things that you know you could

1438
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,240
you could kind of offset and i'm not

1439
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,000
saying all of it can be it can be a

1440
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,040
hybrid model um but it definitely is

1441
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,640
something to explore and also for

1442
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,400
opportunities for people

1443
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,000
when you think about it i know a company

1444
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,280
right now and that's what they're they

1445
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,240
do is they do software as a service

1446
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,839
and they do you know infrastructure

1447
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,079
service and guess what they do sock as a

1448
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,160
service they do it all they have an

1449
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,839
in-house literally

1450
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,000
for anything you need they if you need

1451
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,400
engineers to come in and build help you

1452
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,559
build your product they got that they

1453
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,359
got infra so it's not uncommon it's just

1454
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,599
i think in in the way that we're moving

1455
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,680
with the with the digital you know this

1456
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,680
digital world that we live in you're

1457
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,040
looking at a a large um segment that's

1458
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,559
going to be you know an opportunity for

1459
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,640
people to advance their careers and

1460
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,720
think about you know working with this

1461
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,960
kind of my mindset and this you know and

1462
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,800
my thing is the future is going to be a

1463
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,559
remote workforce and you can work from

1464
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,160
anywhere with the you know the thought

1465
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,880
about satellites being up in in places

1466
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,800
that you're going to have connections

1467
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,880
and remote areas that you in regions of

1468
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,480
the world that you never had you

1469
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,640
literally can have that but you're right

1470
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,000
if you're a small business and you're

1471
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,559
on-prem your mom-paw shop it doesn't it

1472
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,240
doesn't it might be a subscription-based

1473
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,079
model that maybe it doesn't make sense

1474
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,160
for you to go in and say hey i need this

1475
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,319
you know particular solution that might

1476
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,280
not be ideal based upon you know the

1477
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,359
needs of the business and and it

1478
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,640
doesn't you know let's just be honest

1479
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,440
these things are costly and as you start

1480
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,200
start to look at you know building your

1481
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,280
you know growing your business you you

1482
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,280
can't afford you know all these these

1483
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,720
different types of tools so sometimes

1484
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,240
you have to think about hey it would be

1485
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,400
great to have some things offered at

1486
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,240
least i got some kind of sla at least i

1487
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,119
have some sort of uh you know um way

1488
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,800
that i can get into

1489
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,480
looking at cyber security instead of

1490
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,240
being like i got to go all in and it

1491
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,599
cost me so much

1492
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,839
you know um but at the end of the day we

1493
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,480
all need security you know um

1494
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,400
and i think it's important but it also

1495
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,559
creates opportunities for people to be

1496
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,480
innovative and i think that's what what

1497
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,839
i'm really getting at is like if you're

1498
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,920
a threat hunter maybe you can offer your

1499
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,400
service and and you could say hey i

1500
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
might not be a whole total sock but i

1501
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,559
can have someone else who you know does

1502
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,280
uh some other aspect of cyber security

1503
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,800
and we can all go in together somebody's

1504
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,960
getting regulatory compliance and then

1505
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,800
that is basically you offer that and

1506
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,480
that's kind of like what most most

1507
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,839
companies i'm starting to see you are

1508
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,200
doing there's like a couple of people

1509
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,359
who are specialized in certain areas and

1510
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,680
it could just be you know you go in and

1511
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,839
assess it and then do it do what you

1512
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,440
have to do your due diligence to figure

1513
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,079
out

1514
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,079
maybe we can offer this as a service

1515
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,800
based upon this sla and then it could be

1516
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,200
something that you could you know to um

1517
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,079
build a your own brand based on that so

1518
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,599
that that was the reason why one of the

1519
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:02,800
things that i thought was interesting i

1520
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,559
saw a lot of companies by the way if you

1521
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:05,520
research

1522
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,160
and uh you will find a ton even att i

1523
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,680
was kind of surprised they offer it you

1524
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,839
know i was like that's ingenious you

1525
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,520
know because people you know small

1526
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,520
businesses who wouldn't want something

1527
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,040
and you know at least to say hey you

1528
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,520
know at t i love it you know you got

1529
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,760
your cable then you go and you get your

1530
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,839
sock as a service you got you know you

1531
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,520
got everything bundled into one is what

1532
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,119
i'm saying so that that's kind of what

1533
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,200
