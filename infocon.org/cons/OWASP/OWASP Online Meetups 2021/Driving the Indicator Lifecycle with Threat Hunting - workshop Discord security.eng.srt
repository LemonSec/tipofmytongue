uh is basically what we've been doing

82
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,879
for the last five years you know trying

83
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,319
to help people people to get into the uh

84
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,680
cyber security

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,599
community but you know we're we're

86
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,400
emphasizing and we're focusing on uh

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
veterans and underrepresented

88
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,640
communities to getting you know into

89
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,840
here so

90
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,040
so far um you know we started this in uh

91
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,760
august uh we've been doing some beta

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,800
testing with some members you know they

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,599
they successfully uh grab well i want to

94
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,040
say graduated because we're not at

95
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,480
school or anything like that but we

96
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
basically they they went through our

97
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,080
program they found jobs in the field now

98
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,000
i remember exactly where they work if

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,799
they work in intel or amazon

100
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,280
and another pen testing company but

101
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,400
regardless you know we help them to to

102
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,599
get to that

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,920
point and and that's how we measure

104
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,239
success you know until you get a job in

105
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,920
the field that's how we're measuring

106
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,720
success and obviously we cannot do it

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,680

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,320
yep

151
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,600
okay sweet

152
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
all right so today i'm gonna go over the

153
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,520
threat hunting process um and how you

154
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
can use it to facilitate the indicator

155
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,360
life cycle

156
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,960
so when i was putting together this

157
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,720
presentation it was based off one that i

158
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
gave internally to the

159
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,960
mdr team earlier this year i'm just

160
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
talking about kind of demystifying some

161
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,240
elements of

162
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,479
the threat hunting process and mapping

163
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,720
it back to kind of the roots in the

164
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,319
indicator life cycle

165
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,639
which i would consider as kind of some

166
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,440
some base theory um to do with how we do

167
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,880
our job and how we process threat

168
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,720
intelligence

169
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,639
um before we get into that um just got

170
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,199
to introduce myself so um

171
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,120
i work as marco said i work with the

172
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,960
40 guard responder team so the manage

173
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,199
detection and response team um so we

174
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,240
have we monitor um you know the edr end

175
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,080
points that we have all over the world

176
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,280
um

177
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
trying to stop any activity in customer

178
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
environments and uh

179
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,199
that gives us good visibility i guess at

180
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,120
the coal face of emerging threats

181
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
because we have a pretty good

182
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,919
subsection of different industries as

183
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,479
well as different regions

184
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,840
so yeah it's a

185
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
awesome opportunity

186
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,440
and we get to apply some of this

187
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,720
knowledge that i'm going to talk about

188
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,160
today

189
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
my background is i

190
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,120
earlier this year at the start of this

191
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,599
year i i left the military so i just i

192
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,199
spent 10 years in there

193
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,919
doing electrical engineering and then

194
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,240
cyber security related stuff so my

195
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,639
backgrounds in incident response

196
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,000
vulnerability assessment threat

197
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,599
assessment and

198
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,840
then threat hunting

199
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,160
all right for this presentation stop me

200
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
at any time just jump in

201
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
i don't have to chat up because i'm in

202
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,639
present mode but just yell out and i can

203
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,000
stop and clarify any of the points

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,400
this topic obviously is quite

205
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,080
complicated when you link all the pieces

206
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,840
together so i've tried to carve out a

207
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,120
section

208
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,960
i wasn't really sure of levels of

209
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
implied knowledge so if you do have a

210
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,440
question stop me and i can

211
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,639
fill you in on some of the terms

212
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,479
all right so today this is what we're

213
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,520
going to go over so i'm going to

214
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,199
introduce the indicator life cycle what

215
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,520
it is then we're going to go over threat

216
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,599
hunting definitions try to cut through

217
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,120
some of that marketing stuff about what

218
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,039
threat hunting is and then map that

219
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,440
across the indicator life cycle uh when

220
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,919
i say map i'll show you how

221
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,160
threat hunting is really an extension of

222
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,319
enabling the indicator lifecycle and

223
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,039
also how it can uh better facilitate

224
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:13,759
that

225
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,120
then we'll go through some takeaways and

226
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,400
then i'll

227
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,919
questions at the end if you guys don't

228
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,719
want to interrupt me

229
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,240
all right so um the concept was

230
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,120
originally introduced by lockheed martin

231
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,440
alongside the cyber kill chain in a

232
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,479
really long titled uh document called

233
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,080
intelligence driven

234
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,640
commun computer network defense informed

235
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,880
by analysis of adversary campaigns and

236
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,399
intrusion kill chains

237
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,279
so

238
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,919
back in 2011 our lockheed martin

239
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,760
introduced that and it's really formed

240
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,160
the basis of a lot of concepts that we

241
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,760
apply from the at least the defender

242
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,279
perspective

243
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,920
to do our job better all right so it

244
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,399
introduced the kill chain it introduced

245
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,800
indicator life cycle and it introduced

246
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,959
something called defender courses of

247
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,880
action

248
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,760
which i think we'll go over soon

249
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,399
now focusing on the indicator life cycle

250
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,560
it defines three states and also the

251
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,080
requirements for the transition of the

252
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,480
states

253
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,760
so

254
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,920
the indicator lifestyle life cycle

255
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,080
starts with threat

256
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,959
or indicators or threat intelligence

257
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,600
being reported right so you what that

258
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,360
looks like is an organization might

259
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,279
subscribe to an intel feed

260
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,839
that reports revealed indicators so

261
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,160
these are indicators that are known um

262
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,080
and we can kind of we expect that the

263
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,839
reporting will map those and provide the

264
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,320
context in which they were detected

265
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,440
the next step is that um a a sock team

266
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,080
will leverage those indicators um by

267
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
incorporating them into discovery and

268
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,800
detection colors making them matured all

269
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,480
right so that's where we understand it

270
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
so this is really when you take

271
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,560
something from external and then you can

272
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,720
you mature it in the context of your own

273
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,440
organization

274
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,920
the next step

275
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,760
the next part of the process i guess is

276
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,160
to discover those so organizations

277
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,640
discover indicators while executing

278
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,399
discovery and detection colours making

279
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,760
them utilized so this is where we might

280
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,079
do perform deliberate activities to try

281
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,320
to identify those indicators inside our

282
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,880
environment

283
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,440
then the next step is the analyze step

284
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,519
so this is where the organization will

285
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,000
analyze those to reveal additional

286
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,480
indicators associated with the intrusion

287
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
so this is uh pivoting and this is for

288
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,399
me the interesting part of our job which

289
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,240
is where we we find

290
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,399
kind of the breadcrumbs from known

291
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,560
indicators and then we use those to

292
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,439
identify more

293
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,959
so the loop really occurs there moving

294
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,959
from the analysis to the leverage so as

295
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,880
we find those new

296
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,839
uh those new indicators they basically

297
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,600
form their report function and they

298
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,440
become revealed and then the cycle

299
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,000
continues

300
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,200
so as an example what that might look

301
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,920
like with some practical iss you receive

302
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,399
a threat feed right your team might pull

303
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,560
out some indicators um so these are some

304
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,360
ones from uh you know real indicators

305
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
from earlier in the year

306
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,120
so we got some ips there and we got some

307
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,240
domains

308
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,560
all right so these at this stage

309
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,360
the indicators are revealed all right so

310
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,519
then we can leverage those so to do that

311
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,120
we might do something like configure the

312
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
board of firewalls to block the ips

313
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
sinkhole domains at the endpoints or

314
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,200
through your dns server we also might

315
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
build some detections inside our seam

316
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,120
that will alert us when those ips

317
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,800
pop up or we see any comms to or from

318
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,519
those ips

319
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,760
now to discover those those seam alerts

320
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,240
um that connections from the endpoints

321
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,880
uh have been detected and blocked the i

322
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
the it team might isolate the host and

323
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,120
then re-image that affected endpoint

324
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,120
so then we would move up and down the

325
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040
kill chain based off that initial

326
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,320
reporting

327
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,680
to determine

328
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,360
what

329
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,240
what indicators we might have missed

330
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,680
and whether there's anything else that

331
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
we can start adding to our set of

332
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,519
detected iocs

333
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,440
so that we can continue to be effective

334
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,800
against that particular threat

335
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,360
now

336
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,279
from our experience

337
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,040
marco probably has some examples of this

338
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,680
as well this is what we often see from

339
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,639
customers so that feed will come in

340
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,959
they'll they'll put the blocks in place

341
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,959
or they'll put their detections in place

342
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,079
the seam will alert it so for example in

343
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,320
in this one we might start to see that

344
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,920
um the scene alerted on a detect on a

345
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,120
uh

346
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
communication to a malicious domain

347
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,880
right so in this case uh cash cow.ai

348
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,279
that was blocked the it the it team

349
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,200
identify the host and then re-image

350
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,399
then we usually see the team

351
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,320
mark that as job done

352
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,399
alright so they'll isolate the host

353
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,079
they'll reimage it and then that's it

354
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,560
so the failure to perform the analysis

355
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,680
is there

356
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,320
now what that means in this particular

357
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,800
instance

358
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,399
all right is we had a set of ips that

359
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,560
were provided all right those ips

360
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,320
actually mapped to the initial

361
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,040
exploitation that rio conducts

362
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,279
okay

363
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,360
and the domains map to

364
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,279
c2 following the implant being

365
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,199
successfully delivered and executed in

366
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,120
the environment

367
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,120
so we detected and mitigated here

368
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,639
but we

369
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,120
the customer in this instance failed to

370
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,800
identify that they'd already been

371
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,760
compromised and so because they didn't

372
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,240
do that analysis step they weren't able

373
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,560
to determine that

374
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,399
there is obviously a vulnerability that

375
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,399
the adversary can move to gain access to

376
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,560
the environment and it's likely

377
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,800
coincidental that they were unlucky that

378
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,560
they were able to block the

379
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,040
activity you know at the c2 stage that

380
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,120
they had some indicators for the c2

381
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,519
stage

382
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,279
so really

383
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,920
positive hits on a known uh known atomic

384
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,240
iocs should be analyzed in the context

385
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
of fuller full intrusion and that's

386
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,320
super important now i know that this

387
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,240
might sound super obvious

388
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
but we see time and time again that this

389
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,600
doesn't get done so

390
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,040
marco and the rest of the team will be

391
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,480
sending out

392
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,800
notifications to a customer uh usually

393
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,560
the larger customers saying we've

394
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,399
identified this activity in your

395
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,399
environment this is indicative of this

396
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,440
actor

397
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,240
you should look here here and here and

398
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,720
often we'll hear nothing back or we'll

399
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,320
just see the end point drop off

400
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,079
and then come back on a day or two later

401
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,160
all right we don't get a follow-up

402
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,760
or they'll message back and say don't

403
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,079
worry we've already re-imaged that host

404
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,680
right so it's a failure to do that

405
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,479
initial access

406
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,440
i'll come back to what that means

407
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,399
shortly

408
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,639
so why is this so hard why are we not

409
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,079
able to facilitate this it really starts

410
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,199
um with the reporting stage right so

411
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,639
threat intel is not filtered for

412
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,079
relevance

413
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,199
okay so that results in a huge volume of

414
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,360
uh indicators coming through that's

415
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,839
difficult to process at a high level and

416
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,440
ingest properly and properly understand

417
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,839
what those indicators mean

418
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,800
secondly reporting often removes context

419
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,320
now this is probably a really key

420
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,440
takeaway

421
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,720
and we'll get to that in the leverage

422
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,800
section shortly

423
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,560
context makes the data structures

424
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,639
difficult to manage and understand so

425
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,000
you know we might have seen a miss

426
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,680
instance stood up which does give you

427
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,759
some of that additional context

428
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,480
but

429
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,800
that's not all used and it's often

430
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,279
difficult to make those data structures

431
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,759
readable for us as analysts and also

432
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,199
readable for

433
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,399
automated tools or um you know the the

434
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,160
applications that we're using to process

435
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,719
that data

436
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,040
so what this become what this starts to

437
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,480
become is

438
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,519
an ioc life cycle not a detailed

439
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,839
indicator life cycle right with that

440
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,959
additional context

441
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,920
also the usability or problem with

442
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
reporting is the usability window keeps

443
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,199
getting smaller

444
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,120
at the moment adversaries i guess with

445
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,560
the move towards um you know cloud-based

446
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,519
offerings like you know azure and

447
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,480
you know market like uh google cloud and

448
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,160
stuff

449
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,320
adversary is able to turn over there

450
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,959
those atomic indicators quite quickly

451
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,360
which means that the effective window

452
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
that those iocs have gets smaller and

453
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,680
smaller

454
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,599
so the leverage section is hard um

455
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,599
because defender collars typically

456
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,160
leverage atomic indicators

457
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,679
not the context all right so we block an

458
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,000
ip address or we delete a file with a

459
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,679
certain file hash we prevent it from

460
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,400
executing with our edr or our av

461
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,959
something like that all right we don't

462
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,280
those tools don't

463
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,439
like actively ingest

464
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,000
the context of an indicator

465
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,080
okay unless they're designed in that

466
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,559
particular way it's not really relevant

467
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,480
at this stage because of that it

468
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,640
normally gets stripped uh like stripped

469
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,880
out

470
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,120
also leverage is technically difficult

471
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,600
okay so it requires working knowledge of

472
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,840
all the limitations of our tool coverage

473
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,080
as well as a strong understanding of the

474
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,720
adversary ttps so that's when i talk

475
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,200
about leveraging the context itself

476
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,480
so

477
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,760
discovery

478
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,840
obviously is

479
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,000
in my opinion the easiest portion of it

480
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,799
when we uh use our tools correctly so i

481
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,559
haven't i'm not going to focus on why

482
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,120
that's difficult but the analysis stage

483
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,799
is hard because of the reasons we

484
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,559
previously talked about with reporting

485
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,840
and leverage

486
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,240
the con in most cases the context of the

487
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,320
indicator has been stripped making quick

488
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,400
analysis difficult all right so what we

489
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,039
need to do is if we identify a hit on an

490
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,360
iac we need to go back we need to

491
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,679
identify what was the report the

492
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,160
original reporting where that came from

493
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,559
all right what did that reporting say

494
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,640
where does this particular ic map to in

495
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,919
the kill chain

496
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,760
all right what are we missing

497
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
all right so that may that is kind of

498
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,679
where we break the chain of being out of

499
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,440
automate using standard tools

500
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,840
analysis is time consuming without that

501
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,160
context like i said and very difficult

502
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,880
to scale

503
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,320
one of the biggest problems that we deal

504
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,280
with

505
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,960
from the customer perspective is it's

506
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,520
hard to justify the investigations when

507
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,760
in the resource limited environment so

508
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,280
those of you that are working in you

509
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,880
know socks at the moment will understand

510
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
that we're all really busy

511
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,000
and so

512
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,320
often we get this you know idea that we

513
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,000
stop the attack what's the big deal why

514
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,480
do we need to keep focusing yeah sure we

515
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,919
might have missed some indicators early

516
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,960
on

517
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
but uh we stopped it so what's the

518
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,840
problem

519
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,520
so symptoms of failure i guess i'll go

520
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,080
through each of the sections and uh

521
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,360
have a think about if you guys are

522
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,440
working in blue teams around there

523
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,679
you know around the us

524
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,760
see if any of these symptoms you see

525
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,200
them in your environment and you can

526
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,960
probably track these back to a failure

527
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,240
at one stage of the indicator life cycle

528
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,440
so

529
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,799
one of the symptoms of failure for

530
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,840
leverage is the failure to mature the

531
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,200
iocs all right so you might see

532
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
incidents occur with known indicators

533
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,840
only revealed during ir engagements so

534
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,120
you aren't detecting these as they

535
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
happen you're behind the eight ball all

536
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,840
right

537
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,679
ineffective storage and processing

538
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,200
throughput so in this particular

539
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,640
instance

540
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,080
what we're talking about here is you

541
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,000
have too many iocs that you're looking

542
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,799
for

543
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,400
which results in you constantly having

544
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,120
to purchase more storage in your scene

545
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,400
all right

546
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,240
more compute because it's slowed down

547
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,320
because it's checking for 50 000 ips

548
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,400
most of them aren't relevant anymore all

549
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,919
right

550
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,799
pointless irrelevant iocs

551
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,559
so symptoms of failure of the discovery

552
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,600
stage is delayed discovery or no

553
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
detection

554
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,400
all right

555
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,159
pretty straightforward

556
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,080
and then failure to analyze

557
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,000
typically we see

558
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,679
like i talked about with our customers

559
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,760
we would see repeated intrusions and

560
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,840
repeated intrusions that when you do the

561
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
analysis of the incident it could be

562
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,000
tracked back to the same root cause so

563
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,720
if we go back to

564
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,720
if we go back to here

565
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,840
what that what that usually um what we

566
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,400
usually see there is that

567
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,320
the adversary continues to use these

568
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,240
same initial access methods these same

569
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,400
exploitation methods same delivery

570
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,799
method delivery methods but we're only

571
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,760
blocking here at actions on target or c2

572
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,919
all right that that's the result of

573
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,880
failure to analyze

574
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,120
so

575
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,559
what does this have to do with the

576
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,000
indicator lot what does this have to do

577
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
with threat hunting all right before we

578
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,080
jump into that i'll just go through some

579
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,960
uh

580
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,880
some quick definitions now i'm not

581
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,039
interested here in defining what threat

582
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,720
hunting is i'm sure that you guys have

583
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,559
all seen it before or heard it around

584
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,400
the traps the term used so i've just

585
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,600
taken three offline um three from

586
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,360
you know various vendors

587
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,200
um and we can start to see some

588
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,799
commonalities in there

589
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,640
all right so in this one we've got

590
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,120
proactively and iteratively searching

591
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,039
advanced threats and evade existing

592
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,360
security solutions

593
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,960
in this one here we're seeing similar

594
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,640
terms used

595
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,360
some key elements inside there

596
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,719
and this one here as well

597
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,440
so taking those key points out

598
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,320
right proactive so we should be practice

599
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,919
should be considered relative to the

600
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,840
adversary's actions on objectives so

601
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,679
going back to the going back to the kill

602
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,039
chain right

603
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,960
what does proactive mean okay we can't

604
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,120
really see into the future

605
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,640
as much as me being ahead of you in a

606
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,240
time zone means like you know we can't

607
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,720
look that far ahead all right so

608
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,919
proactive refers to before the adversary

609
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,240
gets done what they intended to do in

610
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,320
your environment so detecting them early

611
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,799
in the kill chain

612
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,159
when we're performing throughout hunting

613
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,159
there's always a defined threat so it's

614
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,760
a discrete activity and we're looking

615
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,919
for something in particular we don't

616
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,799
just do a threat hunt that says we're

617
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,280
looking for bad stuff okay that's not a

618
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,799
very targeted approach and it's

619
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,640
typically going to result in a waste of

620
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,520
in a waste of time

621
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,320
the last one is you know somewhat

622
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,159
controversial

623
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,039
but we aren't using atomic iocs at least

624
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,120
as the basis for our threat hunt all

625
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,159
right

626
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,400
as you can see from those definitions

627
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,679
we're looking at things that haven't

628
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,159
been detected through existing

629
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,880
solutions okay if we are automating the

630
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,200
ingestion of threat intel fees we're

631
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,000
looking at those atomic indicators right

632
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,679
we should be detecting all of the known

633
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,440
stuff threat hunting should be looking

634
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,600
for the unknown

635
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
all

636
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,720
right so

637
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
with this threat hunting which i'll go

638
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,159
through a couple of steps that you can

639
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,000
use as kind of a high-level practical

640
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,720
way of doing it um these this is this is

641
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,159
the link all right

642
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,480
so what we aim to do is build a model of

643
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,640
what an intrusion by a particular threat

644
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,360
would look like in our environment

645
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,840
we use this model to identify to where

646
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,320
to look for indicators but when we talk

647
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,720
about indicators instead of focusing on

648
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
the atomic indicators

649
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,440
we will focus on the ttps and behaviors

650
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,919
associated with relevant threats

651
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,320
so kind of think of it as previously the

652
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,480
issue that we were having with

653
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,559
the indicator life cycle as i talked

654
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,360
about earlier was we were removing the

655
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,400
context

656
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,080
from those indicators which meant when

657
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,760
we got to the final step once they were

658
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,440
utilized it was difficult for us to

659
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,640
track back

660
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,120
so the way around that is only focusing

661
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
on the context and you make the context

662
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,520
your indicators okay which means that at

663
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,760
the end the next step is easier doing

664
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,240
that analysis is easier

665
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,200
all right

666
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,240
so to

667
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,480
do that we threaten intelligence should

668
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,320
identify the threats that are relevant

669
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,039
to our environment so that means instead

670
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,440
of when we're looking at like say a blog

671
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,080
online and you might see a threat and

672
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,120
you might go is this relevant to me

673
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,799
the temptation can be to jump straight

674
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,039
to the i o sections ioc section at the

675
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,120
bottom you know chuck those into your

676
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,200
firewall make sure they're in your feed

677
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,880
and then tick the box saying we're good

678
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,000
to go

679
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,159
what we're trying to do here is instead

680
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,840
of looking at that section which is

681
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,360
still important don't want to downplay

682
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
the importance of that

683
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,080
we want to look instead at what's in the

684
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,840
content of the article to understand the

685
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,919
behaviors and how they might exhibit

686
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,159
themselves in our environment okay and

687
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,400
then use that to identify

688
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,080
atomic indicators that are relevant to

689
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,120
us

690
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,799
they're relevant to the specific

691
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,039
environment that we're defending all

692
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,840
right because if we do that we can find

693
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
those indicators that we care about

694
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,440
without having to filter and without

695
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,279
having to go back to work out the

696
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,320
context from previous

697
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,679
reporting so i guess that last well the

698
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,200
second last point there is using the

699
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,360
resources we have in our environment we

700
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,000
need to plan defender colors to identify

701
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,400
and mitigate expected ttps as we see

702
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,960
them so this is front loading ourselves

703
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,480
with the tools that we need to be able

704
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,440
to

705
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,919
take action on atomic indicators that we

706
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,000
find

707
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,679
okay

708
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,720
now

709
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,559
here like i said we're focusing on the

710
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,840
context

711
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,000
all right to streamline the analysis and

712
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,480
then we thought because of that

713
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,559
work that we did early in planning for

714
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,799
this threat hunt we can fast track those

715
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,000
indicators

716
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,840
all the way around to be utilized as

717
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,399
quickly as possible

718
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,440
so really what we're facilitating here

719
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,799
is

720
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,720
by focusing on the context is we're

721
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,880
preparing ourselves to fast track this

722
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,080
analysis

723
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,039
and then inject those atomic iss back

724
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,480
back into the process here

725
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,400
so if we kind of flatten the old

726
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,640
indicator life cycle

727
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,240
and then fit it to

728
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,679
a

729
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,240
more generic approach to threat hunting

730
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,480
we'll get something that looks like this

731
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,080
so there's four steps which i'll go

732
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,120
through now

733
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,200
which we can do to

734
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
practically get after this ttp-based

735
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,960
threat hunting

736
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,840
okay

737
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,720
so firstly we develop an applicable ttp

738
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,360
list so we take our relevant threats uh

739
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,279
we have a look at them we work out what

740
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,840
ttps are applicable all right and then

741
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,240
we we collate those map those to them to

742
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,760
a mitre attack framework or something

743
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,840
similar

744
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,440
um to make sure that we have full kill

745
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,799
chain coverage

746
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,520
then we'll develop those ttps so then

747
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,840
we'll develop indicators so these

748
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
technical indicators associated with

749
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,320
each of those ttps and then add that to

750
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,520
our list all right that's making those

751
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,360
moving those indicators and leveraging

752
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,960
them um

753
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,559
to i guess better understand what they

754
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,080
actually mean from athletic intel

755
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,840
reporting

756
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,200
next thing that we do is we mature those

757
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,600
ttp indicators by developing in the

758
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,760
implementation plan so this is how we're

759
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,039
going to use these

760
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,000
so how we're going to detect those ttps

761
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,760
in the context of the tools that we have

762
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,520
available to us in our specific

763
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,799
environment

764
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,880
all right so kind of a transition point

765
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,840
here

766
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,559
is that this is theoretical okay this

767
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,480
this is uh

768
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,320
this is uh all to do with the ttps

769
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,360
and kind of the art of the possible uh

770
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
for one of a better term there what what

771
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
could we possibly look for to identify

772
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,200
that and then we transition to the

773
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,360
practical it's like all right cool we

774
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,440
know what we want to look for can we get

775
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,080
that and how do we get that

776
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,840
then the last part is where we utilize

777
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,240
it is where we execute the hunt so we go

778
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,080
through our plan we try to find those

779
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,720
ttps

780
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,279
so going through each of those steps in

781
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,360
a bit more detail so when we are

782
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,679
developing this ttp list

783
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,559
it needs to be task driven all right so

784
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,480
skipping to the bottom points there we

785
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,240
need to understand what our threat hunt

786
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,880
is

787
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,960
is looking for so we're hunting for

788
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,520
evidence of a particular threat actor

789
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,960
right are we looking for evidence of

790
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,720
vulnerability being exploited in the

791
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,039
context of our environment

792
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,000
are we hunting for just a particular ttp

793
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,080
so thinking back to you know recent

794
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,760
blogs you might read or i know you guys

795
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,000
some red team you guys are heavy red

796
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,240
teamers if you guys developing your own

797
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,720
exploits kind of flipping it on its head

798
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,880
and trying to work out

799
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,120
how might this look if this was

800
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,799
implemented sorry if this was used

801
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,159
against me

802
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,159
okay

803
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,880
from that we take that list of ttp's map

804
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,200
to the mitre framework that's that's my

805
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,360
preferred framework to map it to what

806
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,600
are the technical indicators of these

807
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,760
all right so the last point there that i

808
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,919
got on the left there is not bounded by

809
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,880
the technical limitations right in here

810
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,840
we just want to be looking at what

811
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,080
possibly we could find

812
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,000
what possible technical indicator what

813
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,159
piece of information could i find from

814
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,000
that end point or from the network

815
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,279
traffic

816
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,360
that would allow me to

817
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,000
identify this activity

818
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,279
the reason why that's so important

819
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,440
is because we might not have in the next

820
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,120
step we might not have the capability to

821
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,600
detect that now but taking note of it

822
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,720
here

823
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,279
if we constantly say we can't get this

824
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,679
one particular technical artifact that

825
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,080
we need to be able to take this ttp

826
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,399
if we see multiple ttps that all need

827
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,559
that same artifact what we've identified

828
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,960
there is a gap in our tooling all right

829
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,559
and that's something that we internally

830
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,399
might want to invest in with potentially

831
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,960
a new product or invest time in

832
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,279
making sure that we adapt our

833
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,120
tools that we do have to make sure that

834
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,399
we can detect that in the future

835
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,880
all right so the output of this stage

836
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,440
sorry just going back from the ttp list

837
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,760
back to the ttp list here is the output

838
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,720
is a consolidated list of ttps that we

839
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,120
aim to hunt for in a particular activity

840
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
maps of the kill chain mapped to a

841
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,799
particular threat all right that threat

842
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,360
being a vulnerability or a ttp or an

843
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,320
actual threat actor

844
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,080
the output is their second stage which

845
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,320
is we're converting those to indicators

846
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,360
is a consolidated list of indicators

847
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,519
mapped to those ttps

848
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,120
that we're planning to hunt for map to

849
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,880
the kill chain mapped to the threat okay

850
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,559
so this is just a progression of that

851
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,640
initial list

852
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,159
i'll go through an example of one of

853
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,480
these that we've produced um soon

854
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,960
so this is the hardest bit in my opinion

855
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,799
okay so this is the bit that as

856
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,480
defenders we need a this is where we

857
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,559
should be focusing our effort on right

858
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,559
so this is where we convert you know the

859
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,240
art of the possible that we developed in

860
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,480
the ttp indicator list we work out how

861
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,679
we're going to do that with the tools

862
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,880
that we have available to us

863
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,760
now here uh you'll see it in the example

864
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,720
i like to break this down into discovery

865
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,120
and then detection okay so discovery is

866
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,039
looking for historical evidence of a

867
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,279
particular ttp and then detection is

868
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,200
making sure that we're able to detect or

869
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,519
we're alerted to

870
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,880
new activity

871
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,039
associated with these ttps

872
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,519
okay so

873
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,200
think of discovery is active so we're

874
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,559
going out to look has this happened

875
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,200
before and detection as

876
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,279
passive so my tool is going to be

877
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,600
telling me when this happens again

878
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,559
okay

879
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,640
so this is like tuning your scene rules

880
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,880
things like that how what room what rule

881
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,240
might we add

882
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
um if we suspect it's this particular

883
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,559
actor what what what artifacts are we

884
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,559
going to pull deliberately to try to

885
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,840
define those indicators

886
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,679
the output of this is that we have a

887
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,760
consolidated list of identification

888
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,320
which is that discovery and detection um

889
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,080
colors and also mitigation colors so

890
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,440
this is something that's kind of an

891
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,960
optional component of it depending on

892
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,880
how your team's broken up but during

893
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,000
this stage what we would also develop is

894
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,919
a set of mitigations

895
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,360
that

896
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,600
combat http

897
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,679
so if we see a phishing email that comes

898
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,360
through and we identify it through our

899
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,679
discovery how are we then going to stop

900
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,200
this from occurring

901
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,720
anymore like how we're going to stop

902
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,000
this fishing campaign from being

903
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,840
effective in our environment which is

904
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,519
effectively how we're going to use the

905
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,320
atomic indicators that we find

906
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,159
how we're going to apply those to make

907
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,519
sure they can be utilized

908
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,960
and then

909
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,279
the interesting bit the fun bit which is

910
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,519
executing the hunt okay so during this

911
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,559
the questions that we're going to ask

912
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,440
ourselves um uh what intimidate what

913
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,960
atomic indicators are going to be

914
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,640
associated with each of these ttp

915
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,039
indicators sorry with each detection of

916
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,600
each of these ttps all right what can we

917
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,840
expect

918
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,720
do the ttp indicators

919
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,600
that we do find do they align with the

920
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,360
relevant threats so say if we're looking

921
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,760
for actor a right and actor a uses a

922
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,159
kill chain that you know it goes you

923
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:52,960
know

924
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,640
phishing

925
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,880
then then the actor comes in and then

926
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,960
installation is uh

927
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,320
potentially they just spin up their

928
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,360
malware

929
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,080
they've got a macro that downloads a

930
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,640
you know malicious payload say quackbot

931
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,119
for example sets up persistence how does

932
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,239
that work

933
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,359
um and then they you know access the ad

934
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,320
perform enumeration dump creds

935
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,079
pull data right

936
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,760
are each of those steps that we're

937
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,599
seeing that we're detecting from our

938
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,320
indicators do they align with the actor

939
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
that we're hunting for now or is this

940
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,599
something new

941
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,520
okay because if it's something new we

942
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,599
might not have planned we might not have

943
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,679
an implementation plan on what to do so

944
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,440
potentially go back to the drawing board

945
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,719
work out how we're going to approach

946
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,959
that switch to more of a traditional ir

947
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,119
also as we're executing that hunt the

948
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,599
end goal is not to you know find cool

949
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,320
interesting stuff the aim is to mitigate

950
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
threats in our environment as quickly as

951
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,440
possible

952
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,199
before they're able to take actions on

953
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,520
target so if you identify an attack we

954
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,960
don't want to just keep going through

955
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,760
the discovery phase we want to convert

956
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,599
that information that we found to

957
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,200
mitigations as quickly as possible

958
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,359
i only got before i keep going does

959
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,280
anybody have any questions on those

960
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,760
steps to the process

961
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,480
sweet

962
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,520
so the outcomes of this overall process

963
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,880
are um

964
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,160
you know there's a whole bunch of them

965
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,240
but mapping them across to the indicator

966
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,200
life cycle we have a list of indicators

967
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,000
associated with tt please employed by

968
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,760
identified threats that we've deemed as

969
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,520
relevant and then mapped to kill chain

970
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,760
and the threat so that means these ttp

971
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,400
indicators are revealed

972
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,720
we also have a plan for

973
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,880
identifying this activity and mitigating

974
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,400
it um within the context of the

975
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,240
defendant system all right so these are

976
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,680
matured indicators

977
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
also we have an assessment of whether

978
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,079
indicators this is after we've executed

979
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,520
the hunt where the indicators are

980
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,200
present in the environment and what the

981
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,119
implications are regarding progression

982
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,520
through the kill chain so if we detect

983
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,119
this indicator that means that the

984
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,680
adversary is here so back to the aerial

985
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
example if we detect one of these

986
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,720
domains right if we detect c2 that looks

987
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,040
like this this means the adversary is in

988
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,280
c2

989
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,680
in our hunt plan what have we missed

990
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,599
what what indicators have we missed what

991
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,200
do we need to go back and look for if

992
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,680
it's the same actor

993
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,800
the reason why this is super useful this

994
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,200
entire process as much as it can be time

995
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,760
consuming is it identifies gaps in our

996
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,320
discovery and detection capabilities so

997
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,200
that

998
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,280
conversion to the implementation plan

999
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
lets us identify what are we going to

1000
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,920
miss okay which allows us to prioritize

1001
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,839
resources

1002
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,160
and work out you know what we might

1003
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,480
invest in in terms of more technology or

1004
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,440
how we might refocus our efforts

1005
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,200
by aligning with the mitre attack

1006
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,839
framework we can reuse detections for

1007
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,200
similar threats all right so

1008
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,839
obviously if we have enough threat

1009
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:04,880
hunting

1010
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,000
um

1011
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,560
i guess plans and we've

1012
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,400
gone through this process a number of

1013
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,760
times

1014
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,160
as new actors come in all we're really

1015
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,320
all they're really doing is taking we

1016
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,000
can take indicators that we've already

1017
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,920
planned for

1018
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,920
all right and map those to the for a new

1019
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,160
threat hunter activity okay and we'll be

1020
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,839
tweaking those indicators slightly

1021
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,280
because there might be a different way

1022
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,359
that a particular actor uses it but we

1023
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,960
can continue to reuse the work that

1024
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,359
we've done

1025
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,160
this process also supports technical

1026
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,440
attribution beyond simple atomic ioc

1027
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,240
crossover so instead of now we just get

1028
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,920
a detection that says

1029
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,040
um

1030
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,520
this is this ip has previously been

1031
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,800
associated with you know a real campaign

1032
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,839
right

1033
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,200
instead

1034
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,800
we can take the

1035
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,680
detection for that particular indicator

1036
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,800
right

1037
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,599
and actually do attribution based off

1038
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,160
you know then either like the the

1039
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,839
diamond model applied to each step of

1040
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,560
the kill chain or we might use it to

1041
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,800
better inform something like uh

1042
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,880
one of the newer models like miktik or

1043
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,800
something like that all right we can

1044
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,839
perform that attribution much easier

1045
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,279
because we have that context

1046
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,079
all right so

1047
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,680
i'll show you what

1048
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,200
an example

1049
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,520
looks like of one of these kind of

1050
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,359
planning activities all right this is a

1051
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,240
draft one that we did um that the team

1052
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,359
and i did for the conti playbooks so i'm

1053
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,800
sure you guys all saw that when it came

1054
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,359
out in august so what we did was we went

1055
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,720
through those

1056
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,480
and we mapped all of the

1057
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,160
ttps that were inside that um to mida

1058
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,000
right so there's a lot of them um but we

1059
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,960
took each step of each of the tactics or

1060
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
kind of the mitre equivalent of the kill

1061
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,839
chain

1062
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,240
um we've got each of those worked out

1063
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,920
what stages were

1064
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,440
we had evidence for based off the

1065
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
playbooks

1066
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,720
and then we went through and worked out

1067
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,320
all of the techniques

1068
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,160
okay so when we're talking about the

1069
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,440
steps right um

1070
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,880
talking about these steps here we

1071
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,119
developed the ttp list so we decided

1072
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,480
that the relevant threat for us was

1073
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,880
conti at the time we developed a ttp

1074
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,200
list that's employed by the actor

1075
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,359
then what we did was down in this

1076
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:26,880
section here

1077
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,920
is we developed the indicators and the

1078
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,480
indicator descriptions okay so

1079
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,079
what are we actually looking for

1080
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,000
technically what is that

1081
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,680
what does that look like all right for

1082
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,160
each of these ttps

1083
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,960
so

1084
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,359
in this in this example here we took

1085
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,520
this particular ttp what technical

1086
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,720
indicators could we find all right

1087
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,599
so

1088
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,280
looking back across here that's the

1089
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,800
focus on this area

1090
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,720
then we developed an implementation plan

1091
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,240
obviously in our job we're focused on

1092
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,839
using 40 edr

1093
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,119
so what we did

1094
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,520
was we determined

1095
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,599
what that indicator might look like in

1096
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,920
the context of 40 edr 40 edr

1097
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,240
has telemetry that's divided up into a

1098
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,240
bunch of chunks all right

1099
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,079
from here we identified what pieces of

1100
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,319
telemetry we might want to collect that

1101
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,560
would allow us that would show us this

1102
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,720
technical indicator okay

1103
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,520
then we developed discovery like i said

1104
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,040
and then detection

1105
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,160
courses of action for each of these ttps

1106
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,040
okay

1107
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,480
and so we went through that built

1108
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,319
queries that we would use for through

1109
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,400
the 40dr internal scene

1110
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,760
and uh

1111
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,680
worked out how we might start to detect

1112
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,920
some of these high level ttps now we

1113
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,960
still included you might see it in here

1114
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,359
in some cases we still included

1115
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,200
the atomic indicators because they're

1116
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,440
still got good value but that wasn't the

1117
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,480
core component of

1118
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,920
of the threat hunt

1119
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,680
all right we did that because it's easy

1120
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,040
for us to automate those searches

1121
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,319
but um

1122
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,800
yeah this is how we practically go

1123
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,560
through the process now these eventually

1124
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,800
get updated into our an internal library

1125
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,240
that then get applied to a customer's

1126
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,040
environment um but that's practically

1127
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,200
an example of how it might look like

1128
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,200
we've restricted these to be within the

1129
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,800
scope of our tools okay so discovery you

1130
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,240
know some of that's a bit more vague

1131
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,319
because it's related to how the ir team

1132
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,000
would do it and these ones here are a

1133
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,839
lot more specific because this is where

1134
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,680
our team's focus is and we have good

1135
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,520
access um through those detections

1136
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,839
anyway jumping straight back into this

1137
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,200
all right any questions on that example

1138
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,640
before i go into the takeaways

1139
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,760
okay sweet

1140
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,720
so

1141
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,119
key takeaways um if i went through that

1142
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,800
too fast

1143
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,760
would be

1144
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,640
only using atomic indicators um

1145
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,319
inhibits the analysis through loss of

1146
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,720
context which breaks that cycle okay

1147
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
that doesn't mean what i'm saying is

1148
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,319
don't ingest atomic indicators and use

1149
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,240
those to mitigate activity in your

1150
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,400
environment it's easy to implement but

1151
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,800
it's it's incomplete and often

1152
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,119
has it's nuanced right there is issues

1153
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,640
associated with it

1154
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,480
if that's all you do

1155
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,599
threat hunting allows us um to follow

1156
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,440
the indicator life cycle

1157
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,760
by only focusing on the context which is

1158
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,560
a required step of that analysis stage

1159
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,200
all right with the threat hunting we

1160
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,119
look for what we don't know yet and so

1161
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,160
we're able to quickly and in a targeted

1162
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,560
way identify those atomic indicators to

1163
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,400
allow us to quickly take action and

1164
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,040
mitigate observed activity

1165
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,800
all right

1166
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
if you find indicators through your

1167
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,079
threat hunting

1168
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,359
given you're only looking through your

1169
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,359
environment you don't have they don't

1170
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,119
need to be filtered all right you've got

1171
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,079
relevant actionable indicators straight

1172
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,240
off the bat that you can trust um you

1173
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,680
know the source of them

1174
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,680
and you know that they're gonna you know

1175
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,480
give you the ability to take action

1176
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,400
quickly

1177
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,079
with that in mind the threat hunting

1178
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,000
process can be time intensive and it

1179
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,400
does require you guys to do it in in a

1180
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,480
dedicated way and often you might not

1181
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,319
have the resources

1182
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,440
but the takeaway point for anybody

1183
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,560
going

1184
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,480
forward from this is even if you are in

1185
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,839
a small team and you don't have a huge

1186
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,079
amount of resources to do this in a in a

1187
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,720
really deliberate way all the time

1188
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,079
when you're reading through those blogs

1189
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,440
about emerging threats or you're

1190
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,040
listening to a brief at a conference or

1191
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,079
something

1192
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,480
instead of just thinking about the you

1193
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,240
know the quick wins the quick iss if

1194
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,680
you're thinking about a you know a

1195
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,280
campaign um that's going on um

1196
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,280
is start thinking about

1197
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,040
the ttps and how they would exhibit

1198
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,800
themselves in your environment and focus

1199
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,880
on building your detections around that

1200
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,640
so don't just skip straight to the ioc

1201
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,359
section at the end

1202
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,240
all right so what's not covered in this

1203
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,920
presentation so i haven't gone over

1204
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,640
defense defender colors in depth i could

1205
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,400
do that later date if that's something

1206
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,079
you guys are interested in

1207
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,440
haven't gone over how to determine

1208
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,880
relevant threats

1209
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,359
um also how to prioritize threats when

1210
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,640
everything is a relevant threat

1211
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,440
we need to be kind of i guess just jump

1212
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,280
into that a little bit we need to

1213
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,599
try to try to focus on what what's

1214
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,960
relevant to us in terms of our

1215
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,520
geopolitical region our industry and

1216
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,440
then current campaigns that are ongoing

1217
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,280
that'll let us focus on

1218
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,760
what's really important

1219
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,599
also not covered is how to convince your

1220
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,280
boss to get a dedicated time to doing

1221
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,880
this stuff i think that this stuff is

1222
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,960
the most interesting and develops like

1223
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,880
the process of going through that threat

1224
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,720
hunting planning gives us the most

1225
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,240
in-depth

1226
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,040
understanding of um adversary ttps and

1227
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,400
improves

1228
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,480
our ability to do our job

1229
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,000
um the other thing that's not covered

1230
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,119
here is

1231
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,280
how to tell marketing people

1232
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,680
to stop calling ipe checks threat

1233
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,839
hunting

1234
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,040
um it's definitely a marketing buzzword

1235
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,040
but this is my interpretation of how we

1236
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,680
would get after hypothesis driven hunt

1237
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,119
and

1238
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,880
combining that with ttp driven hunt

1239
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,599
all right that's it for my presentation

1240
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,400
today um

1241
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,079
does anybody have any questions on the

1242
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,400
content we went through any comments

1243
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,319
anyone want to dispute

1244
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,240
the point of view

1245
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,839
what do you think about the saying or

1246
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,000
the expression defenders live in

1247
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,079
standards and frameworks attackers live

1248
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,599
in real time with motivation

1249
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,599
um

1250
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,119
i think that we

1251
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,280
the attackers can be much more flexible

1252
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,319
with their approach to an intrusion

1253
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,560
they can

1254
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,319
they can flit around between the tools

1255
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,960
that they apply in their environment

1256
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,520
or as part of an attack much more easily

1257
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,960
than

1258
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,200
defenders can we're kind of as defenders

1259
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,200
in my opinion is slow moving beast

1260
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,000
because we have to do things at scale

1261
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,960
so

1262
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,720
that is why i think defenders are very

1263
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,560
focused on frameworks

1264
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,800
because it's the only way for us to

1265
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,720
prioritize

1266
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,720
we can't be as ad hoc as an attacker

1267
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,118
might be

1268
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,200
that that's kind of my two cents so what

1269
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,440
can seem a little bit stifling at times

1270
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,680
to focus on the frameworks

1271
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,560
it's the only way for us to get ahead

1272
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,560
in my opinion

1273
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,040
when you're in a smaller organization

1274
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,760
you know a smaller network

1275
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,480
it's much easier defenders can

1276
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,880
be much more free and move away from

1277
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,800
using things like frameworks

1278
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,920
but that doesn't scale

1279
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,760
so that's why i think

1280
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,079
different approaches

1281
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,480
any more questions or comments

1282
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,359
yeah a lot of

1283
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,599
of groups tend to follow very much

1284
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,520
checkbox approach oriented

1285
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,960
security where they're just trying to

1286
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,200
fill in all the check boxes do any

1287
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,280
information security standards require

1288
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,040
threat hunting in this sort of manner

1289
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,960
um i don't think

1290
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,440
i don't think that they do

1291
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,800
um

1292
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,040
and the reason why i think that is is

1293
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,200
because

1294
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,000
a lot of those

1295
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,520
a lot of the tools that we use like

1296
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,880
covered before a lot of tools that we

1297
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,319
use for defense

1298
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,920
only only

1299
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,079
take action on the atomic indicators so

1300
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,240
the focus is always on the atomic

1301
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,960
indicator but really

1302
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,040
it's kind of cause and effect and we

1303
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,119
focus on chasing the effect rather than

1304
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,760
the cause

1305
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,040
we're always gonna you know be be

1306
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,400
reactive

1307
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,000
but yeah to answer you

1308
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,200
your question

1309
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,079
um

1310
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,640
more directly no i i don't think it is

1311
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,119
uh because it's difficult

1312
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,119
or has previously been difficult to

1313
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,839
action the context and act like perform

1314
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:08,960
this deliberate threat hunting

1315
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,079
activities

1316
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,599
so

1317
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,440
yeah it's it's still a very manual

1318
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,280
process

1319
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,040
because of the flexibility that the

1320
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,119
attackers can use to you know change

1321
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,720
what they're doing it does take a bit of

1322
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,480
critical analysis to be able to come up

1323
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,760
with these

1324
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,000
um

1325
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,640
i guess the transition there's two

1326
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,559
transitions that are that are difficult

1327
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,160
and um

1328
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,920
kind of hard to mark down in terms of

1329
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,760
requirements for say a system or a

1330
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,119
process and that's

1331
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
kind of turning atomic indicators

1332
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,440
tracking that back into working out the

1333
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,599
ttp that was used that generated that

1334
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,200
and then

1335
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,359
you as a defender in the context of your

1336
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,119
environment working out how you're going

1337
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,559
to detect that

1338
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,160
and the reason why i think we get it

1339
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,760
wrong is because that second bit the

1340
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,480
implementation too often we just cut out

1341
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,559
the context and say

1342
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,920
we focus on the bit that we can action

1343
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,200
and so yeah that's why i don't think we

1344
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,520
see any formal

1345
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,760
requirements around threat hunting

1346
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,839
also it's like i said before with the

1347
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,440
marketing

1348
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,119
absolutely smashing the definition of

1349
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,119
threat hunting and still to this day i

1350
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,720
can't find a proper definition it's just

1351
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,319
someone's two cents

1352
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,559
that also makes it difficult to

1353
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,960
kind of mandate or recommend activities

1354
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,200
like this

1355
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,800
yeah i have a question when you try to

1356
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,760
map

1357
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,920
then decay when you're working with the

1358
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,880
mr framework and trying to

1359
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,960
you know map the indicator with a kind

1360
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,000
of specific signature do you try to kind

1361
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,920
of use it against different products for

1362
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,839
example you you know you want to see if

1363
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,760
it is in the endpoint

1364
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,319
product or it is in the network power

1365
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,040
firewall or zeek or network do you or

1366
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,000
you just limit it to particular

1367
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,800
types of uh you know product that you're

1368
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,920
looking to collect from or like windows

1369
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,760
yeah so that's why we gone back

1370
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,800
we

1371
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,480
like i said here

1372
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,480
this one here we don't focus on any

1373
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,880
limitations all right so in my previous

1374
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,800
role um so i was when i was working for

1375
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,800
the air force right um

1376
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,559
the way that our capability was designed

1377
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,319
is we had people that focused on network

1378
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:27,920
and we had people that focused on

1379
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,599
endpoints so host based detections okay

1380
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,040
the reason why we did that is every

1381
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,680
single ttp we would look at from both of

1382
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,440
those aspects does this generate network

1383
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,119
artifacts does this generate host-based

1384
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,200
artifacts okay

1385
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,839
now even though those net in a lot of

1386
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,079
cases the network artifacts were not the

1387
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,559
best way to detect that ttp we were

1388
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,920
still you can still

1389
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,520
combining lots of

1390
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,160
low confidence indicators

1391
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,760
right but seeing them all at once

1392
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,640
converted to a high

1393
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,079
like a high grade

1394
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,440
higher confidence indicator okay so

1395
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,960
on your question

1396
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,200
you should always be looking at this

1397
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,839
step here right developing these ttp

1398
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,599
indicator lists

1399
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,839
outside of what's available to you in

1400
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,520
your environment

1401
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,599
all right this is really in a you can

1402
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,280
obviously you can take that too far and

1403
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,720
you need to work out you know when you

1404
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,359
go on too deep on that but

1405
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,960
you should always be thinking about how

1406
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,680
could i better detect this

1407
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,920
and we ignore what we have until the

1408
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,920
next step okay which is developing this

1409
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,400
implementation plan so to answer your

1410
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,760
question

1411
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,839
for this step here

1412
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,040
we we

1413
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,800
you're right we don't focus on just the

1414
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,040
tools that we have we don't just focus

1415
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,559
on endpoints and we don't just focus on

1416
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,280
network we try to look at everything

1417
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,760
in this step here this is where you say

1418
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,920
all right that's really great

1419
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,920
technically and you go through your list

1420
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,599
and you say how could i do this and this

1421
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:00,800
is where

1422
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,359
this the art of it comes in that people

1423
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,760
talk about the art of defense right

1424
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,440
this is where we need to be looking at

1425
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,839
creative ways where we can

1426
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:10,960
detect

1427
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,839
with what we have

1428
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,280
right this is where we focus on the

1429
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,680
tools that we have available to us

1430
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,040
does that answer your question yeah

1431
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,000
great thanks thanks

1432
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:27,558
all right anyone with any more

1433
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,599
you guys are quiet

1434
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:41,200
they're processing all this stuff

1435
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,760
no and this is the reason why i wanted

1436
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,119
to uh

1437
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,839
mark percentage because um

1438
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,839
you know um

1439
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,720
i know the job that he does for for the

1440
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,280
team and you know

1441
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,640
i think it's one of those important

1442
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,400
aspects when you're you know either

1443
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,440
you're setting up a you know uh security

1444
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,680
program a secure operation center

1445
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,400
uh you know those those are the type of

1446
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,640
things you have to take in consideration

1447
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,240
right you know

1448
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,640
uh and also you know

1449
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,559
as he described you know

1450
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,319
threat hunting you know there is a

1451
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,480
market inside of you know there is a

1452
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,240
definition

1453
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,559
for marketing you know what it is versus

1454
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,319
what it actually is

1455
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,599
and you know um sometimes you know like

1456
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,760
like he said you know uh

1457
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,559
you know the bosses will not teach kane

1458
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,520
you know to to you know will not give

1459
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,400
enough money to to to form a team to to

1460
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,160
do this kind of stuff but it is very

1461
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,240
important because you know that's how

1462
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,400
you defend that's how you win

1463
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,160
otherwise you know

1464
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,440
you're not

1465
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,280
so yeah

1466
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,520
well um

1467
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,640
anybody

1468
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,240
else has any other questions

1469
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,920
hey i'm mark i just want to jump in on

1470
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,680
that one because there's a good point to

1471
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,760
be taken from that if your boss doesn't

1472
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,240
let you do threat hunting that's okay

1473
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,200
this you can stop here

1474
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,280
all right but every time we're reading a

1475
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,559
blog every time you're sitting through

1476
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,319
someone's technical presentation about a

1477
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,200
new you know an intrusion analysis a new

1478
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,200
threat you're on twitter you're seeing a

1479
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,440
new set of ips okay

1480
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,079
try to understand how those ips were

1481
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:23,680
generated right we see

1482
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,119
constantly like quackbots been around

1483
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,240
since what i know 2007 right and it's

1484
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,000
just recently hit a resurgent for

1485
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,240
example it's because it's so resilient

1486
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,920
when it comes to

1487
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,160
changing its atomic indicators

1488
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,599
all right but if we we can look at the

1489
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,359
ttps or the the features of that tool

1490
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:42,880
and what the indicators might look like

1491
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,880
and we can still develop the detections

1492
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,000
that were effective in 2008

1493
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,839
are still effective today if we look at

1494
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,000
it from that particular level right so

1495
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
if you're reading anything kind of

1496
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,960
mentally try to go through these this

1497
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,720
this process of

1498
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,640
all right what what are the indicators

1499
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,119
here okay regardless of how i would

1500
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,359
detect them and this is super useful

1501
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:06,799
when you read something like i work for

1502
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,640
fortinet right i'll be reading cisco

1503
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,599
blogs

1504
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,799
you know i'll be reading you know

1505
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,200
crowdstrike blogs central one blogs all

1506
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,280
that type of stuff now they all present

1507
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,960
their indicators

1508
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,040
because we kind of have to as vendors in

1509
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,599
the context of this bit

1510
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,599
what we need to be doing is trying to

1511
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,839
reverse those

1512
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,839
go hold up go back read through the

1513
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,400
article go back to here and then make

1514
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,359
the jump into our context

1515
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,680
all right so the value of the threat

1516
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,480
hunting process in my opinion is less

1517
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,359
here

1518
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,520
as strange as that sounds but it's more

1519
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,440
in this planning process because this is

1520
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,040
the bit that will let us fast track

1521
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,839
indicators through that cycle

1522
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,280
all right so if your boss doesn't let

1523
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,400
you do it

1524
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,079
or it doesn't let you dedicate time to

1525
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:55,920
threat hunting at least you can go

1526
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,240
through this bit and

1527
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,480
you'll identify deficiencies in your

1528
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,559
ability to detect by

1529
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,559
at this stage here

1530
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,400
all right so you can use that to ask for

1531
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,799
more resources you can say practically

1532
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,400
these threats

1533
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,920
so you can you know back when we talk

1534
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,079
about relevant threats you can say

1535
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,559
all you work for a bank

1536
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,640
we've experienced a significant uptick

1537
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,720
in the last six months of banks being

1538
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,440
targeted by this particular actor we are

1539
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,599
unable to detect these ttps which are

1540
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,440
employed by this actor

1541
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,280
because we don't have the resources

1542
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,440
because my system can't see that because

1543
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,520
the license that we purchased doesn't

1544
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,240
let us you know dive deep enough to find

1545
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,000
the atomic indicators

1546
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,520
they're the type you can use this

1547
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,799
process

1548
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,079
to

1549
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,480
you know justify those purchases

1550
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,720
um yeah all right

1551
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,880
i have one more question apologies maybe

1552
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,640
you covered it earlier

1553
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,280
um so when you run the threat hunting

1554
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,440
you know like

1555
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,760
again if you have a large amount of data

1556
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,520
you know you're gonna be limited with

1557
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,680
the platform you're using for the

1558
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,480
running the searches or the queries

1559
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,200
um so just trying to to have an

1560
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,359
effective threat hunting

1561
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,200
like uh what

1562
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,440
you know cause like six months go back

1563
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,720
to search for it or um or three months

1564
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,040
i'm just curious what would be

1565
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,760
a good way to approach it or just

1566
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,839
narrate to

1567
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:27,599
specific uh few weeks or days what do

1568
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,359
you think it is

1569
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,440
yeah so i think it really depends now

1570
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,119
like in this slide here you can see

1571
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,960
different outcomes to find different

1572
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,920
approaches so when we're de

1573
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,520
a threat hunt

1574
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,799
right is a discrete activity

1575
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,680
all right so what you need to be

1576
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,680
what you need to be kind of working out

1577
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,400
there is what am i trying to find and if

1578
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,520
you produce that idea and then you go

1579
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,440
into this planning process with that

1580
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,440
that will answer that question for you

1581
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,960
so

1582
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,040
let's say that you

1583
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,480
you read an article that says that

1584
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,440
let's take proxy shell for example

1585
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,599
starting on august 25th pretty much

1586
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,359
after orange reduced his proof of

1587
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,240
concept code a couple days after that

1588
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,079
stuff started just absolutely lighting

1589
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:16,960
up

1590
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,319
so what you might do from a threat

1591
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,319
hunting perspective is you might say i

1592
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:23,440
want to i want to we have an exchange

1593
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,880
server

1594
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,119
these threat actors have been known to

1595
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,200
be actively exploiting

1596
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,280
proxy shell

1597
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,920
i'm going to look for evidence from the

1598
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,640
25th to now indicative of

1599
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,400
a proxy shell

1600
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,200
initiated intrusion

1601
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,960
and that would be your that would be

1602
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,119
your threat hunt all right so that's the

1603
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,160
the discrete outcome for that activity

1604
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,079
all right so when you determine how far

1605
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:53,520
you go back that's

1606
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,359
that's should be based on what your

1607
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,720
outcome is

1608
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,319
so if your outcome is

1609
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,480
you're hunting for previous activity

1610
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,880
associated with this particular actor

1611
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,160
i mean you look back through as much

1612
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,680
data as you can

1613
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,400
but also when we look back to

1614
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,079
oh wait scroll through that'll take way

1615
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,599
too long

1616
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,440
when we look back at

1617
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,920
you know the

1618
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,599
the kill chain here

1619
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,079
when we do our threath planning

1620
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,240
we should be looking at mapping those

1621
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,720
ttps to each of these

1622
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,319
these steps

1623
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,799
now you can choose to prioritize your

1624
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,559
threat hunting and it might it might be

1625
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,319
a discrete activity that goes for six

1626
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,319
months now you might do one threat

1627
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,000
hunted last six months

1628
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,200
first you might focus on ttps here or

1629
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,040
actions on target here to work out if

1630
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,799
you've been popped previously and then

1631
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:44,559
you might work backwards

1632
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:45,520
all right

1633
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,599
often we find it's best not to move

1634
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,319
forward from my experience because

1635
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,079
if you're stuck here looking at you know

1636
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,599
delivery or exploitation and they're

1637
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,440
already in your network

1638
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,559
right

1639
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,960
you probably want to be mitigating that

1640
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,559
before we start trying to backtrack and

1641
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,000
find indicators associated here

1642
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,839
all right so

1643
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,720
your your question was how do we

1644
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,559
how do we determine the start or end

1645
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,040
yeah um you determine at the start and

1646
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,200
you define your activity

1647
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,280
oh great thanks that was very helpful i

1648
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,520
think

1649
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,280
all right anymore i got plenty of time

1650
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,319
guys so

1651
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,559
um

1652
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,720
yeah those are great questions uh you

1653
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,000
know

1654
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,160
and uh definitely great answers so thank

1655
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,480
you so much uh any any other questions

1656
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,839
guys i know

1657
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,520
you know sometimes you guys are shy so

1658
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,040
just keep them coming

1659
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,960
otherwise we have to pass on to irvine

1660
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,680
and you know you know how that goes

1661
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,490
oh daring

1662
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:53,109
[Laughter]

1663
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,119
i mean you're not wrong

1664
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,839
so how we practically apply this

1665
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,599
with the 40 mdr team it's something that

1666
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,160
we're trying to build into our service

1667
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,520
more at the moment but what we do is we

1668
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,359
determine the relevant threats for a

1669
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,319
customer like i said based on their size

1670
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,280
their geopolitical region um

1671
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,520
as well as their industry and work out

1672
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,680
what actors are targeting them

1673
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,960
and then we can take a look at their

1674
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,119
infrastructure and if let's say they're

1675
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:24,559
they're running they're running an

1676
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,160
exchange they're running a bunch of web

1677
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,559
servers we can look at current campaigns

1678
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,160
that are targeting that

1679
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,079
and then we produce one big prioritized

1680
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,599
threat list

1681
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,079
and then based on on that threat list we

1682
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,839
have a standing set of

1683
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,040
threat hunt

1684
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,119
we call them threat hunt cards which are

1685
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,079
pre-planned for each of the ttps that

1686
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,720
will be employed by each actor as a new

1687
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,400
ttp comes out so new emerging threats we

1688
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,720
develop another threat hunt card that

1689
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,400
allows us to look for those evidence of

1690
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,079
those ttps

1691
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,839
for each customer we get in that

1692
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:01,839
relevant threat list that prioritize

1693
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:02,880
threat list

1694
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,240
and then we

1695
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,000
take that and then we get our huge

1696
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,319
database of um

1697
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:09,520
indicators

1698
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,240
and we chuckle that

1699
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,720
into it and we we take all of the

1700
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,000
relevant ttps put it in a big list

1701
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,319
and then through our internal systems we

1702
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,480
have that mapped directly to threat hunt

1703
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,559
queries right that would allow us to

1704
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,280
detect those particular tcps

1705
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,039
we put those in a customer's environment

1706
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:30,720
we tune them and then they're set up to

1707
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,480
detect

1708
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,359
all right

1709
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,200
if they ask us to do discovery then we

1710
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,880
do discovering we look for historical

1711
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,720
activity but a lot of our stuff is all

1712
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,880
about pre-preparing an environment

1713
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,839
for that

1714
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,760
detection piece

1715
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,680
so that's how we get after it now we're

1716
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,400
lucky

1717
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,280
well

1718
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,039
lucky and not lucky at the same time i

1719
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,200
guess is that we are restricted to the

1720
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,880
tool which is in our instance 40 edr um

1721
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,880
you guys

1722
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,720
it's good to have bumpers but it's also

1723
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,640
frustrating sometimes when we don't have

1724
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,680
any ability to detect a particular

1725
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,880
ttp

1726
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,920
now

1727
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,920
we all always have

1728
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,799
full kill chain coverage but often one

1729
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:15,359
small piece of the ttp one small slice

1730
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,359
we can't get

1731
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,520
you guys in customer environments where

1732
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,200
you've got access to network you've got

1733
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,839
access to multiple you know data sources

1734
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,520
you guys are really in the best position

1735
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,520
compared to us to be able to make sure

1736
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,520
that you can tick off every

1737
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,400
every ttp

1738
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:36,799
alrighty

1739
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:39,839

yep awesome i'll i'll check that up on

1797
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:34,400
later um nice to meet all you guys i'll

1798
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,480
see you around all right thank you thank

1799
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,280
you

1800
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,280
all right so our next presentation will

1801
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,480
be uh airbnb presenting on

1802
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,640
you know discord security and other

1803
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,079
stuff so

1804
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,880
the the main reason why we decided to to

1805
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,119
do this is because um

1806
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,280
oh look there's a shark

1807
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,599
uh it's because you know raw he's very

1808
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,599
against this chord and he doesn't like

1809
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,119
it so

1810
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,119
this presentation is

1811
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,839
to make a rod like discord so

1812
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,559
that's the whole purpose why we're going

1813
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:11,920
to spend the next hour yep yep yep so

1814
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,039
we're gonna

1815
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,680
the mission is to convince rod that this

1816
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,720
score

1817
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,119
it's working better than slack and you

1818
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:21,200
know we just try to move away from slack

1819
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,039
to this sport and you know stuff like

1820
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,200
that so yep yep

1821
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,760
anyways with that um you know the floor

1822
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,280
floor is yours man

1823
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,880

1850
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,599
i will turn off my camera and mic and

1851
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,720
let bradley take over

1852
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:33,839
all right

1853
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:36,319
yeah originally um i actually worked on

1854
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,599
this with max who's also on the team

1855
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:40,880
but um

1856
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,640
he had uh some personal reasons he

1857
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,599
couldn't come but you know this is uh

1858
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,480
dedicated to max i guess

1859
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,000
since he couldn't be here unfortunately

1860
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,480
all right

1861
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,839
go ahead and share my browser

1862
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,240
so yeah i mean yeah we got some context

1863
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,480
onto why this is a um

1864
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,599
this presentation is a thing you know uh

1865
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,680
have some doubters i guess for discord

1866
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,160
and you know don't get me wrong i think

1867
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,680
i think discord and slack both have

1868
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,680
their

1869
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,359
you know pros and cons but you know i've

1870
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:19,198
got to get into discord and

1871
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,439
everything about it

1872
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,040
basically um

1873
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,120
can you guys see my browser here

1874
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,158
that good

1875
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:27,040
yep

1876
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,080
all right

1877
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,920
cool all right so first thing i'm gonna

1878
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,040
do well

1879
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,960
in order to get started uh we're gonna

1880
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,040
need

1881
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,600
we're gonna need a discord account so

1882
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,600
i advise if you want to follow along i

1883
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,479
advise you make a discord account

1884
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,799
and you could actually uh replicate a

1885
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:46,238
lot of the things that i'll end up doing

1886
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:49,120
it's not going to be anything

1887
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:51,759
that can't be replicated on your own

1888
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:52,799
computer

1889
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,359
account i'm sure a lot of you at least

1890
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:56,799
have a discord account maybe you don't

1891
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:57,839
use it

1892
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,679
but

1893
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:00,880
yeah

1894
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,799
okay so first thing i'm going to do is

1895
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:03,920
uh

1896
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,479
add irvin as a friend um

1897
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,880
so when we start off on discord uh

1898
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,520
one of the few concerns i found

1899
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,640
um

1900
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,640
just about discord in general really i

1901
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,000
like the

1902
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,120
i guess the confusion with the interface

1903
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,120
so over here

1904
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,399
i'm just going to start off with some

1905
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:23,920
basics of like

1906
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,759
discord and its layout

1907
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,439
over here you see

1908
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,439
there's like a thin line separating the

1909
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,359
discord icon and then

1910
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,319
here you would have a list of servers

1911
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,719
and you're possibly part of a server

1912
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,479
here i only have one server i mean this

1913
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:40,640
isn't my main account but you know

1914
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,960
yeah um

1915
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,000
so um yeah below this line you're gonna

1916
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,600
find your servers and uh you know you

1917
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,520
could explore public servers and

1918
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,439
everything you can create your own

1919
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:53,600
and um above it

1920
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,040
you'll you'll see that your list of

1921
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,719
direct messages so i haven't actually

1922
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,719
messaged the urban

1923
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,840
at all

1924
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,520
so just go ahead and wave high i guess

1925
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,120
and um

1926
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,199
yeah i mean you have a look you wave

1927
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,920
high as well so

1928
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,480
yeah so the hear the friends it shows

1929
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,320
you could add a friend and you know each

1930
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,880
username is it doesn't have to be unique

1931
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,960
it just has a unique like four digits

1932
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,080
after

1933
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,360
that like kind of identifies you

1934
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,360
um

1935
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,400
yeah

1936
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,639
so

1937
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,520
i think from here um

1938
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,040
when you really when you want to start

1939
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,400
creating a server and really getting

1940
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,719
like a community together on discord um

1941
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,400
you know originally this did start as

1942
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,320
like kind of like just a gaming platform

1943
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,520
for people to communicate on but

1944
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,040
yeah i mean like you

1945
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,719
there's really like you can see just by

1946
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:47,760
the templates you know it's really

1947
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,000
branched out into something else and um

1948
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,440
you know by clicking here on this plus

1949
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,880
sign you can see

1950
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,239
um

1951
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,360
you know you could create your own

1952
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,440
server no requirements you could just go

1953
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,960
ahead and start off

1954
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,800
and um you know there's the templates

1955
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,360
and or you can start from scratch but uh

1956
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,719
for me i'm just going to go ahead and

1957
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,960
display the local community template

1958
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,679
i'd say it's sort of relevant um

1959
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,159
let's say for a club or community and um

1960
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:15,040
when you start making a discord server

1961
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,360
um

1962
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,040
you can put a picture there's a lot of

1963
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,560
ways to really customize it um but

1964
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,840
you know i'm just gonna leave it like

1965
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,080
this just for

1966
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,480
just a blank server for now um when you

1967
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,239
start off especially uh if you have a

1968
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:32,560
completely new account

1969
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,239
you'll get a lot of bubbles like this

1970
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,800
that will like uh show you

1971
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,760
um

1972
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,360
you know different features right here

1973
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,920
it's just uh mentioning a new feature

1974
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,520
scheduled events

1975
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,640
we're gonna go ahead and dismiss that

1976
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,400
for now this is like a page service

1977
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,320
don't got it

1978
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,800
just to dismiss that for now so with um

1979
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,800
when you create a server with a template

1980
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,760
um

1981
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,600
you have a list it actually gives you

1982
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,520
like pre-made

1983
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,760
text channels and voice channels and as

1984
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,960
you can see here each text channel

1985
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,960
so there is the sidebar with the list of

1986
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,880
your servers and right now i'm in my own

1987
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,040
um and you know i could bounce between

1988
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,520
them just with a click

1989
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,120
but these text channels are separated by

1990
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,800
the different sections so it's like a

1991
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,080
drop down

1992
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,199
um

1993
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,239
and you know

1994
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:21,920
you could actually some people may have

1995
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,480
different access to different um

1996
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,080
text channels but i'll get into that in

1997
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,280
a little bit

1998
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,280
um

1999
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,480
really when you

2000
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,159
when you when you start off with the

2001
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:35,920
discord server like this you will have

2002
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,440
like you could consider this i mean it

2003
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,719
gives you a basic template and it's

2004
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:41,040
actually really um useful because it

2005
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,880
gives you kind of like a welcome mat for

2006
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,800
people so like let's say um

2007
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,600
i would just say uh welcome

2008
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,239
welcome to my server i don't know you

2009
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:51,600
can just have a message like that just

2010
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,960
to start off

2011
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,560
and

2012
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,400
really um

2013
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,159
a lot of the times some servers will

2014
01:12:58,159 --> 01:12:59,520
only show you this

2015
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,920
and i'll show you how to actually make

2016
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,480
it so they can't see anything until

2017
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,400
whatever you ask for them from them

2018
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,520
basically

2019
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,199
so

2020
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,960
first thing i'm going to do is actually

2021
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,880
invite irvin

2022
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,480
to the discord server and so in order to

2023
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,159
invite people you know it gives you an

2024
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:18,719
indicator right here you click here you

2025
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,960
click invite but you can also

2026
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,360
actually um

2027
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,679
you can create an invite link and right

2028
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,000
now it's hidden um because i'm on stream

2029
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,320
remote but typically invite link will um

2030
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,320
you can you can edit how long it works

2031
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,640
for um so your server could have just

2032
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,760
one

2033
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,880
um invite link that is just

2034
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,640
the only one and it's shared amongst

2035
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,080
everyone or you could have one let's say

2036
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,560
you don't want certain people joining

2037
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,400
after a certain date or you don't want

2038
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,679
to

2039
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:51,920
random people joining i mean you can you

2040
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,760
can make it expire in 30 minutes if you

2041
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,000
want or something and you know

2042
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,920
uh you could also have like how many

2043
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,440
people can actually click on this link

2044
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,679
and join your server

2045
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,440
and really this is good in case you

2046
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,120
don't want like completely random people

2047
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,120
just being able to join or someone just

2048
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,640
making you know

2049
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,480
inviting people that you don't want on

2050
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,040
your server perhaps but um

2051
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,159
and you know there's the temporary

2052
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:17,760
membership as well uh but yeah i i you

2053
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,440
can also just do the shortcut with your

2054
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,480
friends

2055
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,719
and um

2056
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,440
yeah so we have irvin here

2057
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,199
and the first thing i wanted to get into

2058
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,520
was uh just basic moderation on a

2059
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,760
discord server it's if you were to have

2060
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,600
one like with your friends and stuff you

2061
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,440
know maybe like it's a little more loose

2062
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,679
on moderation

2063
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:38,560
but

2064
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,000
if you're gonna have a community discord

2065
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,159
server something where you want it to be

2066
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:43,520
kind of like on a

2067
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,679
a bit larger scale let's say more than

2068
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,360
like 10 people or something and it's

2069
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,360
like you want to be a little more uh

2070
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,600
clean i guess you can say in terms of uh

2071
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,120
just the layout and everything and

2072
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:56,880
rules

2073
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,800
um the first thing you have to start

2074
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,800
doing is really you want to check out

2075
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,400
the roles um

2076
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,760
the first thing you want to do is you

2077
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,080
want to create an admin role uh

2078
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,920
so just go ahead and you click through

2079
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,440
the roles just name it admin

2080
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,880
you know change the color you can make

2081
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,480
it something like a i don't know like an

2082
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,400
aggressive red or something and whatever

2083
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,480
you can make it purple pink doesn't

2084
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,640
matter it's really customizable like i

2085
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,480
mentioned earlier

2086
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,280
um

2087
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,640
i think a really neat thing is you can

2088
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,679
separate the list of uh roles for

2089
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,239
different members um oh you go ahead and

2090
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,480
save changes before you do anything

2091
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,000
but yeah you can

2092
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,440
there's a list over here on the right

2093
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,760
side uh it says online see we i haven't

2094
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,360
assigned any roles so it just shows two

2095
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,360
people in line but it'll separate once i

2096
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,360
assign the rules

2097
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,400
um so you go to roles and to really get

2098
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:50,000
your admin role going

2099
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,440
you want to go ahead and start off with

2100
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,199
the permissions

2101
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:54,000
so

2102
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,480
uh really uh for admins i mean you'd

2103
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,480
want look you are the owner but if you

2104
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,800
want an admin you know

2105
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,199
aside from yourself of course

2106
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,800
you would want them to have pretty much

2107
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,520
every single permission um you know it

2108
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,360
it varies of course maybe you want to be

2109
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,480
like the

2110
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,920
you want to have like the

2111
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,840
the most permissions out of everyone or

2112
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,280
maybe you want someone to be on equal

2113
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,320
footing

2114
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,840
but

2115
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,040
yeah i mean you could just go ahead and

2116
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,040
check through these uh really the

2117
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,840
permissions for roles are

2118
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,239
um pretty straightforward i mean

2119
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,760
there's a lot of things like managing

2120
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,080
roles manage channels view channels it

2121
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,000
lets you view everything you know some

2122
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,280
channels may be hidden but if you have

2123
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,400
viewed channels on your role

2124
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:38,480
they'll be able to view the channels as

2125
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,760
soon as they join but if you don't want

2126
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,080
that to happen there's actually a way to

2127
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,640
you can turn it off

2128
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,080
but we're going to keep it on since it's

2129
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,920
for the admin obviously

2130
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,199
view audit logs

2131
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:50,480
auto logs can be important you know if

2132
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:54,400
you have any problems on the server um

2133
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,320
and you want to you know look at the

2134
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,080
audit logs for them it's like a record

2135
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,600
of this right here allows members to

2136
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,120
view a record of who made which changes

2137
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,480
in the server so let's say you have some

2138
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,080
admins and uh someone did something

2139
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:04,880
wrong

2140
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:05,920
or

2141
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,320
made a mistake and no one's i don't know

2142
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,679
you want to figure out who did it

2143
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:12,000
there's the audit log

2144
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,880
here loves manage servers create invites

2145
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,679
so um you know you can if you have like

2146
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,360
another role which is just for like a

2147
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,840
regular member of the

2148
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,679
discord server

2149
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,000
um sometimes you'll be in a discord

2150
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,199
server where you can't create an invite

2151
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,199
once you're in so like this actually if

2152
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,120
you disable this for someone for we're

2153
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,400
going to keep it on free admins but if

2154
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,080
you disable it you know it'll

2155
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,280
it's like

2156
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,719
so they can't just invite whoever they

2157
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:40,239
want into the discord server but if you

2158
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,560
want them to do that then go ahead

2159
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,320
change the nicknames kick members band

2160
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,159
members that's pretty self-explanatory

2161
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,000
for an admin role

2162
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,360
um

2163
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,960
you know send messages everything's

2164
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,280
checked off really manage messages

2165
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,880
manage threads so you can have like

2166
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:58,480
threads within discord servers that um

2167
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,480
actually you know you could have like a

2168
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,239
topic kind of like

2169
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,480
um off to not not necessarily off to the

2170
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,560
side but just have its own section so

2171
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,320
that it doesn't flood a text channel

2172
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,840
which is pretty convenient actually

2173
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,080
uh text-to-speech messages um

2174
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,840
you know typically

2175
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,280
people don't like that on the server so

2176
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,800
i'm just gonna keep it i'll keep it on

2177
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,600
but you know for a regular thing

2178
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,440
generally they don't have that on

2179
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,600
um

2180
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,560
priority speaking this you know

2181
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,560
it's just so you like if you're a little

2182
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,000
louder than other people i don't really

2183
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,920
like that it's not really a

2184
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,239
convenient thing i don't think unless

2185
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:41,440
you're like presenting within the

2186
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,800
discord server then of course you know

2187
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,239
it'd be pretty decent if you had like a

2188
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:47,120
presenter role uh which you can add

2189
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,880
just uh an example

2190
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,239
um it's a mute defend move members

2191
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:54,239
management so yeah i showed you all the

2192
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:55,440
permissions

2193
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,760
um but really for the admin role uh this

2194
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,199
is the advanced permission of just

2195
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:02,640
making them an administrator um

2196
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,480
and you know you got to be careful with

2197
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,159
making people administrators of course

2198
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,120
uh

2199
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,520
like obviously

2200
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,199
you know as discord is telling you right

2201
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,800
here in bold this is a dangerous

2202
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,640
permission to grant of course it is

2203
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,000
because you know they have complete

2204
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,280
control it's like they're an owner of

2205
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,719
the server as well

2206
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:20,719
um at this point when you turn on but

2207
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:21,840
i'm going to go ahead and turn it on for

2208
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:22,800
here

2209
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,159
and um

2210
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,360
yeah go ahead and uh

2211
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,800
add myself

2212
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,960
as an admin member sorry irvin you're

2213
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,360
not an admin in this server

2214
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,280
but

2215
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,159
and uh from here um

2216
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,320
you do want to create a role

2217
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,600
uh for like people who just join

2218
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,199
uh really

2219
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:47,280
that everyone is for like people who

2220
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,360
join it's it's the default role the

2221
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,960
default permissions for people who just

2222
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,000
joined and so

2223
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:54,960
um

2224
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,719
for now um

2225
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,560
something i want to cover really is uh

2226
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,960
the mention so

2227
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,840
typically if you

2228
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,480
um

2229
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,159
everyone's just sending gifs uh can't

2230
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:09,360
wait to see them but um

2231
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,880
typically when you when you mention

2232
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,800
someone at everyone it mentions the

2233
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,120
whole server so they all get a

2234
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,040
notification or they all

2235
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,400
they almost likely will get a

2236
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,159
notification out here is everyone on the

2237
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:21,120
server

2238
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,520
right then in that channel and then all

2239
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,520
roles will just that's everyone uh you

2240
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,920
want to disable this typically uh

2241
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,199
it's really

2242
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:30,880
it can be

2243
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,000
um i guess you can call it annoying but

2244
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,760
you know here irvin is at everyone

2245
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,679
the reason being is because tip if you

2246
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:41,040
have a larger server and people don't

2247
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,080
really know

2248
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:42,880
like

2249
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,120
what is acceptable for like you know

2250
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,639
adding everyone

2251
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,960
what's worthy of adding the entire

2252
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,040
server uh for what you're going to say

2253
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,480
you know you can't at everyone and say

2254
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,600
hi and

2255
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,920
that tends to be a problem on discord

2256
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,000
servers or you know any sort of server

2257
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,199
like this

2258
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:02,400
uh so yeah like right here um

2259
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,120
i'm gonna get everyone high uh from from

2260
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,000
urban

2261
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,120
and so

2262
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,560
i don't think we can see that oh

2263
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,679
actually i think i'm gonna go ahead and

2264
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,520
share my whole screen sorry

2265
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,560
uh

2266
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,400
my apologies

2267
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,159
this should be good um can everyone see

2268
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:17,760
my whole screen now go ahead and send a

2269
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:22,000
message urban again at everyone hi

2270
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,080
should be able to see it now

2271
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,800
right here i have the app but you know

2272
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,159
you could you don't have to download the

2273
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:31,280
app if you don't want it you could

2274
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,360
actually just use discord completely

2275
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,520
just through the uh just to the browser

2276
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,280
like i'm doing here but also have it

2277
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,600
over here um

2278
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,639
but yeah

2279
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:43,199
right now i still see your um

2280
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:44,320
your role

2281
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,560
the the role page

2282
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,880
you see the role page

2283
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,199
only can you see the taskbar

2284
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:53,440
yeah

2285
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,880
i can't see what the server oh yeah yeah

2286
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,199
okay yeah sorry um yeah the server is

2287
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,360
right here so yeah there you go you

2288
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:04,080
don't want this happening right here

2289
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,000
really it's like an inconvenience i

2290
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,520
guess because you know typically

2291
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,880
everyone's and all that are used for

2292
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,320
like more important information but you

2293
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,080
could put it in announcements or

2294
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,440
resources

2295
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,719
whatever you really want like that um

2296
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:19,120
yeah you see these type of

2297
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,400
messages

2298
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,440
you know

2299
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,320
this one these two i mean right here not

2300
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,320
really convenient but this court is also

2301
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,239
somewhat smart in that it's maybe seen

2302
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:29,679
he's trying to present and trying to

2303
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:32,400
hide some notifications and such like

2304
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,719
the copy link was hidden

2305
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:36,400
uh so

2306
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,080
that's not guaranteed to happen but

2307
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,320
something you should be aware can happen

2308
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,080
it's trying to protect him in case he

2309
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,560
was streaming to twitch or something

2310
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,159
yeah um really

2311
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:47,679
you can actually enable that yourself

2312
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,920
it's called streamer mode and it it does

2313
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,600
that it disables that it also disables

2314
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,679
notifications from other servers that

2315
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:54,880
you're not currently looking at i

2316
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,560
believe um

2317
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,560
you could do that in your settings your

2318
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,719
user settings it's its own little thing

2319
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:02,239
right there and you see streamer mode is

2320
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:03,840
enabled so you can't see my account

2321
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,040
information if you go to your own

2322
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,560
settings you will be able to see your

2323
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,400
account information your user profile

2324
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,159
your privacy safety everything like that

2325
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:12,320
and i'll go over like user privacy and

2326
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,440
you know

2327
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,719
security later on but for now uh

2328
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,960
really just like the basics of covering

2329
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,880
of uh

2330
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,480
moderating the server so i already

2331
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,719
showed you the roles um we created the

2332
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:25,920
admin role

2333
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,400
and um

2334
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,639
so

2335
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,159
uh

2336
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:35,600
what you can do is um create another

2337
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,320
role uh for the for the people who just

2338
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,639
join and uh let's just call this um i

2339
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:41,840
don't know

2340
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,080
uh

2341
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,679
i guess you can call it you know or max

2342
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:49,120
when he was when we were going through

2343
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,719
this he called them schmucks um

2344
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:54,560
you probably shouldn't do this this is

2345
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,719
kind of mean but um just for the sake of

2346
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:59,040
the presentation and respect the max we

2347
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,480
couldn't make it i'll go ahead and put

2348
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,600
it like that as well um

2349
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,639
and

2350
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:06,000
you can go through permissions this is

2351
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,840
just going to be the default

2352
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,280
um

2353
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,280
role for a discord

2354
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,199
and what i'm actually going to do is i'm

2355
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:14,639
going to disable

2356
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:16,400
a few channels in a bit

2357
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,239
but for now i'll leave it like this uh

2358
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:21,120
and i'm gonna go ahead and add

2359
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,519
irvin

2360
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,239
he is now

2361
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:28,800
schmuck and a roll oh now he has a role

2362
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,280
i mean um it should

2363
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,880
i could actually enable his uh

2364
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,239
right here um

2365
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,679
roles

2366
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:40,960
chuck's

2367
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,880
permissions and

2368
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,920
wait display there you go

2369
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,760
display it separately

2370
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,120
and there you go now you have a split

2371
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,199
off on the side it's very organized very

2372
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:53,360
neatly uh when you have the crown next

2373
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,480
to your name that just means you're the

2374
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,840
server owner

2375
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,880
um yeah

2376
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,239
and

2377
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:05,360
now to go more into the moderation um

2378
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,400
really

2379
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,760
from here

2380
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,560
uh

2381
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,239
there is like obviously the moderation

2382
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:12,480
tab and i'll actually disable streamer

2383
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,440
mode just for this

2384
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,639
not that i'm

2385
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,800
just going to disable it right here

2386
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,159
because i have to show you the

2387
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,480
moderation tab for the server

2388
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,560
so you go to moderation and there's

2389
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,560
verification levels actually so if you

2390
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,800
created an account for this

2391
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,280
um maybe some of you did uh it asked you

2392
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,400
to verify your email address and um

2393
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,000
on servers the reason it's important to

2394
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,920
verify your email address on discord is

2395
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,000
because on some servers you won't be

2396
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,719
able to join if your email address isn't

2397
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,320
verified that's a

2398
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,480
you know if if you can't verify your

2399
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,679
email address

2400
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,440
um you know there's going to be a lot of

2401
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,719
servers you won't be able to join and

2402
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:54,639
that's just the lowest uh

2403
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,719
moderation verification level this is

2404
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:58,000
these are built in

2405
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,360
uh to the discourse servers um

2406
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,120
low must have a verified email on their

2407
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,440
account medium is must also be

2408
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,040
registered on discord for longer than

2409
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,719
five minutes so no one can just create

2410
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:12,320
an account and uh just just i don't know

2411
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,920
bombard your

2412
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,400
discord server with messages like right

2413
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,840
away at least

2414
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,080
hi you know you have to be a member for

2415
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,960
more than 10 minutes and then highest is

2416
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,560
actually you must have a verified phone

2417
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,920
number on the discord account so you

2418
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,760
need to have two factor enabled which is

2419
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:28,639
a

2420
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:30,239
feature on discord as well which i will

2421
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:31,040
cover

2422
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:34,719
later but for now i'll keep it on none

2423
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,400
it's um media content filter uh

2424
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,440
this is just uh

2425
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,840
really you can

2426
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,520
it's like if you're on a public server

2427
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,080
you can make it so scans media

2428
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:51,360
remembers without a role um but we're

2429
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,760
just going to keep that off as well

2430
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,719
for now um

2431
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:58,960
so

2432
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,560
now that we

2433
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,480
have covered that i can go ahead and

2434
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,600
cover just up kicks and bands um

2435
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,360
so it's very simple i'm sure all of you

2436
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,600
understand how kicking someone and

2437
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,920
banning someone works on a discord uh

2438
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,239
well just in general but uh the concept

2439
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:16,320
of banning someone is uh

2440
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,639
they're by account by ip but you don't

2441
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:21,360
you don't have to ban someone uh

2442
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,719
let's say i don't like what urban's

2443
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:23,920
sending

2444
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,199
um

2445
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,440
really you go to the user

2446
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,639
and you right click them and you have

2447
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:31,760
two options to either kick or ban them

2448
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,960
um

2449
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,120
so

2450
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,239
yeah

2451
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,080
you keep sending messages i really don't

2452
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,360
like him or he's sending something

2453
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,800
inappropriate

2454
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,639
you have the options to kick or ban them

2455
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:45,280
um and if you ban or kick them they will

2456
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,880
they will show up in this list right

2457
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,239
here

2458
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,080
uh right now i have no bands i'm not

2459
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,679
gonna ban irvin

2460
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:52,719
um

2461
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:54,239
but

2462
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:55,760
maybe i'll ban him later but not right

2463
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:56,719
now

2464
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:58,080
um

2465
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:01,320
and so

2466
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,639
um

2467
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:03,840
really

2468
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,239
when you kick someone it actually uh

2469
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:10,960
they can join back i mean obviously it

2470
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,360
all depends on your invite links which i

2471
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,400
have right here the ones that i sent um

2472
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,440
urban

2473
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,600
i can actually make the invite link

2474
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,719
invalid

2475
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,880
if i just click it here he won't be able

2476
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,159
to send it to anyone else he won't be

2477
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,080
able to click it again to join again

2478
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:26,960
so

2479
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,239
just so you know your invite links you

2480
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:29,520
can manage them

2481
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:30,320
no

2482
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,360
just so you

2483
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,840
know people don't um you know join when

2484
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:34,960
you don't want them to and it tells you

2485
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,159
how many uses there are too

2486
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:44,320
yeah and

2487
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,600
now i think i'm gonna get into uh the

2488
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,040
more

2489
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,400
i guess uh

2490
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,480
the details of like moderating a server

2491
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,159
really they are the built-in functions

2492
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:55,280
that i

2493
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,679
highlighted for the discord server

2494
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,159
settings but there's also uh discord

2495
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:02,400
bots that um can help you make

2496
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,400
moderating a server like

2497
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,560
very easy

2498
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,400
so

2499
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,480
there's a lot of them people prefer

2500
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:11,600
different ones but i'm gonna go ahead

2501
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,920
and cover dino

2502
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,360
so dino

2503
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,639
it's a

2504
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:20,320
it's a moderation bot it um

2505
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,679
it's just a lot it just helps you

2506
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:23,600
moderate and and give you it has like

2507
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,159
more in-depth uh settings for how you

2508
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:27,120
can

2509
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,800
um manage your

2510
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,520
your server and you can also

2511
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,600
you know have an auto mount auto mod

2512
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,679
which i'm gonna cover right now but in

2513
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:39,520
order to get a discord bot uh dyno uh

2514
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,280
specifically on your server the first

2515
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,600
thing you want to do is actually log in

2516
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46,400
with discord when you're at the page and

2517
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,960
so when you do that um

2518
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,880
logging into discord

2519
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,920
i believe it uses oauth to um

2520
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,159
to log in with your discord account just

2521
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:57,760
like you would log in you know when when

2522
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,600
something asks you to log in with a with

2523
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,920
a google account or like

2524
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,000
a facebook account sometimes

2525
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,520
but you can log in with discord if you

2526
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,040
don't want to put in your information

2527
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,639
and stuff like that here you have to log

2528
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,719
into discord and it tells you what it

2529
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:12,400
has access to

2530
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,199
um

2531
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,920
dyno is a very reputable and trustworthy

2532
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,440
bot so you don't have to worry about

2533
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:18,719
anything

2534
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:20,400
with it but you do have to be careful

2535
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,480
with some bots like especially some more

2536
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,600
uh

2537
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,159
obscure or less used bots you have to be

2538
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,000
careful with what you're dealing with

2539
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,159
um but this is really like information

2540
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:32,719
that just anyone like any friends can

2541
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,960
really see it's not anything crazy let

2542
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,040
me go ahead and authorize it

2543
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:40,000
and now that i authorized it um

2544
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,120
i can

2545
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,800
add it to one of the servers so i'm not

2546
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,840
gonna add it to this one i'm gonna add

2547
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,159
it to the one that i just created

2548
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:48,480
and i'm gonna go ahead and click on it

2549
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,320
and so when i click on it it'll tell me

2550
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,080
what it's gonna be doing in the server

2551
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,440
it's gonna be creating commands in a

2552
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,880
server so let's just go ahead and

2553
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,159
continue

2554
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,000
um and these are the actual permissions

2555
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,920
you're granting it so again be careful

2556
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,520
with what you're adding to your server

2557
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,800
uh dyno is a verified bot so

2558
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,639
um it's verified by discord it's

2559
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:08,480
completely safe i recommend it

2560
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,400
personally it's a great it's a great bot

2561
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,560
that can help you keep the server

2562
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,480
organized and you know

2563
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,719
clean up

2564
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:17,760
yeah just going to keep all the

2565
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,960
permissions and you go ahead and

2566
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,719
authorize it

2567
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:24,560
i am a human so okay this is

2568
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,800
shouldn't have done that to me but

2569
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,400
let me look for some trains real quick

2570
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,080
let me know if i miss one is this a

2571
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:33,920
train or is that like a house

2572
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:36,719
oh well i think i'm good

2573
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:38,639
train train

2574
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:40,800
train train

2575
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,560
um

2576
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,960
okay all right i'm good i found all the

2577
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,360
trains

2578
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,639
when you first get started on dyno um

2579
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,080
it's going to ask you for like what

2580
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,600
prefix you want to use in your commands

2581
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,520
so when you're on a discord server

2582
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,600
a prefix for the commands would be

2583
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,239
question mark by default and so

2584
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:03,920
um i'm just going to leave it how it is

2585
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,040
choosing your timezone you don't have to

2586
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,880
choose your timezone but i'll show you

2587
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,440
how the commands work right now

2588
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,400
um this is the updates channel and um

2589
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,639
for now i'm gonna go ahead and you could

2590
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,400
create a channel that could be like for

2591
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,000
updates or if you use the template like

2592
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,840
i did

2593
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,840
you can actually just i would just click

2594
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,360
announcements for now

2595
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,440
as your updates channel and uh we do not

2596
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,840
want to pay five dollars so

2597
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,400
yeah let's get started with the auto mod

2598
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,719
um

2599
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:34,560
there are different like things that

2600
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,239
dyno can do there's many things that can

2601
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:38,400
do but i feel like it's real

2602
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:42,000
um strength is in its auto mod and

2603
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,760
you can just go ahead and enable it by

2604
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,480
switching this on

2605
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:47,679
and

2606
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:50,639
you want to go to the settings

2607
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:51,679
and really

2608
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,520
auto mod is just

2609
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,840
it can help you uh

2610
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,600
you know like if people you don't want

2611
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,679
people speaking a certain

2612
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:01,760
way using like you know any sort of bad

2613
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,440
words in your

2614
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,600
your discord server or some you want to

2615
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,840
ban some words or some terms anything

2616
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,520
which i recommend

2617
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,360
um

2618
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,120
yeah it gives you like different things

2619
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,560
you can ban as well so these are the

2620
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,520
filters for the auto mod um banned words

2621
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,679
are right here

2622
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:20,880
all caps if you don't want people

2623
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,400
talking in all caps you could enable

2624
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:25,679
that duplicate text fast message spam

2625
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,360
so if i enable that urban won't be able

2626
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,800
to send messages as fast as he is but

2627
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,280
i'm going to leave it like that for now

2628
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,560
you could also if someone sends a

2629
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,880
discord invite within the server you

2630
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,320
could disable that as well you can make

2631
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,600
it so that it gets deleted you don't

2632
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,360
want people shilling their servers on

2633
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,440
your discord go ahead and

2634
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,679
make the auto mod delete those

2635
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:45,760
um mass mentions gets rid of that

2636
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,679
everyone and stuff like that emoji spam

2637
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:48,639
you know

2638
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,400
everything you see here uh the band

2639
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,000
words really it's just like it's it's

2640
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,639
like uh slurs or everything but you

2641
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:55,920
could you could these are like the

2642
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,400
default ones but you could add your own

2643
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,760
if you won't want like let's say i don't

2644
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,239
want people saying something like

2645
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:03,920
i don't know like what if i don't want

2646
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,280
people saying that it doesn't have to be

2647
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,800
necessarily bad words or stories if i

2648
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,080
don't want people saying my name i could

2649

01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,760
it's banned i'm not gonna do that but

2652
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,520
really it's up to you

2653
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,880

2654
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,239

2656
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:22,880
mod

2657
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:25,360

01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,040
already did

2690
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,760
yeah

2691
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,679
um

2692
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:33,440
so for dino

2693
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:36,560
you wanna it makes its own roll uh but

2694
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,280
you wanna make sure dino is

2695
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,840
above

2696
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:43,119
uh the role

2697
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:44,880
the like

2698
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,600
uh bottom row basically the schmucks

2699
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,800
um

2700
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,560
when it when it comes to roles it's

2701
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,600
actually

2702
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,080
really if a role is

2703
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,119
below

2704
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:57,280
another role it can't edit anything

2705
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,040
about that role so it's like a hierarchy

2706
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:02,239
really it's a it's just top to bottom

2707
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:04,560
who has the most permissions or who can

2708
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,000
not really who has the most permissions

2709
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,159
but who can interact with others

2710
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:09,360
um

2711
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,199
and here is probably how you want to

2712
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:12,239
have uh

2713
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:13,840
the

2714
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,840
your moderation

2715
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,560
role set up

2716
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,159
but um you could also have like this if

2717
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:24,320
you want it's not a big deal um

2718
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,760
yeah and so

2719
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:26,880
for here

2720
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,320
um

2721
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,560
i'm gonna go ahead and uh

2722
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,320
check out the modules i already enabled

2723
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,000
the auto mod so everything is everything

2724
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,840
that needs to be banned is banned

2725
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,639
um

2726
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:43,360
what i can do also is actually

2727
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,400
um

2728
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,400
where the

2729
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,040
filter

2730
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:50,800
options

2731
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,960
actually you know there are other things

2732
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,320
i think i'll go ahead and

2733
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,639
actually enable the action log

2734
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:58,639
um which is what i mentioned earlier

2735
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:00,639
through the announcements text channel

2736
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:02,320
um i could just go ahead and select the

2737
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,960
announcements and uh

2738
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,920
i don't know it's uh

2739
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:10,480
anything any logs uh when someone joins

2740
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,920
or when someone leaves or when someone

2741
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,679
gets banned it'll be it'll be reported

2742
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:15,199
here so

2743
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:16,639
when i have this enabled it should be

2744
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:19,040
all good

2745
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:22,159
and you know um dino isn't the only

2746
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:23,920
moderation bot

2747
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:27,119
there's like me six and security bot me

2748
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:29,040
six is really more like

2749
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:30,880
you can tell just by the website it's

2750
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,560
it's a lot more gaming oriented and

2751
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,320
there's like interactions with twitch

2752
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,600
but really they share a lot of

2753
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,960
characteristics it really just comes

2754
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,400
down to how you want it i think dino is

2755
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,880
a lot more well-rounded

2756
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,360
but they share like pretty much

2757
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,360
90 of their features i guess

2758
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,560
maybe like

2759
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,719
that's an exaggeration but yeah this is

2760
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:49,920
more for like gaming so if you want to

2761
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,360
have like a server with your friends

2762
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:54,480
just for like games this is perfect

2763
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,239
there's also security bot which is

2764
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:58,560
actually a lot more it leans more

2765
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,840
towards uh just

2766
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,840
spammers off your server and keeping any

2767
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,719
sort of like uh just risk on your server

2768
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:08,800
out um and you sort of like you could

2769
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,199
get your server nuke by like you know

2770
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,600
a huge spam of messages

2771
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,639
um and the security bot uh all these

2772
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:17,840
bots can actually deal with it but

2773
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,560
security bottom is actually like focused

2774
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,800
on strictly that just uh managing your

2775
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,119
server and right here it says anti new

2776
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:26,880
capabilities so

2777
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,119
you know yeah i recommend all of these

2778
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:30,560
these are all great bots it really just

2779
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,320
comes down to what you want to get out

2780
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,559
of them

2781
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,840
yeah so

2782
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,280
i think

2783
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,400
uh

2784
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,800
really dyno like i said it is the more

2785
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,400
well-rounded one and

2786
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,480
you know in the dashboard i think it's

2787
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,080
very

2788
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,159
it just shows me everything if you want

2789
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:51,280
to moderate your server you can just

2790
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,760
moderate it uh briefly with the discord

2791
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,679
open and the dashboard open it will show

2792
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:58,159
you what everyone has been doing

2793
01:38:58,159 --> 01:39:00,480
while editing the server if you have

2794
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,239
other people with admin permissions you

2795
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:03,119
know

2796
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:05,679
stuff like that

2797
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:07,920
so

2798
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:09,760
i believe

2799
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:10,960
that

2800
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,520
when you make a discord server you need

2801
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:16,639
to make sure that the people joining

2802
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:18,000
are people

2803
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,639
and not bots that would you know

2804
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,960
cause some sort of problems in your

2805
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:27,119
server

2806
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:30,239
i think that you should add a

2807
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:32,639
almost every single time add

2808
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:34,639
some sort of verification

2809
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:37,440
for a server so

2810
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,920
this is a bot that can actually um it's

2811
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,360
called yet another general purpose

2812
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:42,719
discord but i'm not going to say all

2813
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:44,480
that it's just yet another discord bot

2814
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:47,360
maybe um yeah

2815
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:49,679
if you want to say that as well

2816
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:51,760
this has a verification feature and i'm

2817
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:52,880
going to go ahead and add it to the

2818
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,440
server as well just to prevent you know

2819
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,360
any bots from joining

2820
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,040
and so

2821
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:01,760
i think um

2822
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,719
oh yeah so i go ahead and click add to

2823
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:06,960
server and it's the same process it's

2824
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,719
just gonna see you know this is just for

2825
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:11,520
like myself uh the the access to my

2826
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,679
account it's not anything huge

2827
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:15,760
go ahead and authorize it and once i'm

2828
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,360
in i can go to the top right over here

2829
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,760
and i can oh it's right here select

2830
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:24,880
server and i can add this bot to my

2831
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,880
server right there

2832
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,800
and once i do this it it has the same

2833
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,960
purpose as dyno but we're going to do

2834
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,080
something a little different with this

2835
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,440
one

2836
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,880
it's going to create commands in the

2837
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,280
server sure but you know same things

2838
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,119
like i said before careful what you add

2839
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:41,280
but this is another verified bot very

2840
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,040
trustworthy

2841
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:46,000
go ahead and authorize it i am a human

2842
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
um

2843
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,440
see just go ahead and find all the

2844
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,080
trains again

2845
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:54,480
that's a train

2846
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,400
that's a fire truck

2847
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:57,440
that's a

2848
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,520
trolley maybe that's a train to

2849
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,880
a trolley train

2850
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,600
no okay it's it worked out so the bot

2851
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,360
has been added to my server and i can

2852
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:07,840
see it right here it just joined

2853
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,199
and um

2854
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,280
i'll go ahead and uh make sure that it

2855
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:13,280
has its proper role

2856
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:16,159
so just go ahead and put it um

2857
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:18,719
above schmuck's and it doesn't have to

2858
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:20,639
be above admins but

2859
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:22,080
it's not a i don't think there's a big

2860
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,440
difference really um

2861
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:26,880
so

2862
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,280
to get started with your server

2863
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,199
uh and this bot i want to go ahead and

2864
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:34,000
click up here and click your server

2865
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,800
and then um

2866
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,199
i want to head over to the tools and

2867
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:40,880
utilities and you want to go ahead and

2868
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,320
click verification because that's what

2869
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:45,040
we're going to be uh using the spot for

2870
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,119
verification

2871
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:49,119
and um

2872
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:50,960
before i use this i actually wanted to

2873
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,760
use an example of

2874
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:54,719
the

2875
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:56,960
cyber competitions discord server oh

2876
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,040
what is all this

2877
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:01,360
oh i opened a

2878
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,800
tab for the image um

2879
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,480
so i can actually join the cyber

2880
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,080
competitions in square server and i can

2881
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:10,639
uh go and send you the link as well uh

2882
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:12,480
the invite link

2883
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:15,679
ignore my uh purchases from

2884
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:17,600
some other day

2885
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,880
um

2886
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:21,040
when you first joined this server so you

2887
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,920
can tell that you know the moderation um

2888
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,600
it's making me wait 10 minutes so this

2889
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:28,480
is a like the it's above medium in terms

2890
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,760
of the moderation the built-in

2891
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:32,239
moderation but also i can't see any text

2892
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:34,320
channels aside from these three so

2893
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,639
that's probably not right um you know i

2894
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:38,880
have to i can see the rules and i can

2895
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,560
see the events and i can open up a

2896
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:43,040
ticket for support but i can't see

2897
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,040
anything else and reason is because i

2898
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,360
haven't verified myself yet

2899
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,440
so you you get a dm

2900
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,520
from the bot

2901
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:52,639
and

2902
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:55,199
it's asking you to solve a captcha

2903
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:56,800
you know are you a bot i don't think i

2904
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,800
am so i'm gonna go and click on it

2905
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,800
and um

2906
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,719
here for this server they have rules and

2907
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,159
verifications

2908
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:05,920
um you know the rules that we just saw

2909
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,239
and you gotta read all those

2910
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:09,199
before

2911
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:10,719
you go in you have to verify you're not

2912
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:13,119
a bot and once you hit continue

2913
01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:15,199
you go back to the server

2914
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:18,719
and you can see everything so i can type

2915
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:20,239
i can see the text channels that i'm

2916
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:22,719
allowed to see as a regular user

2917
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:25,360
i can join the voice channel if i'd like

2918
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,679
and yeah that's a that's a good example

2919
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:29,600
of this bot so in order to integrate it

2920
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:32,239
into our server

2921
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:34,960
in order to integrate it we must

2922
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:37,040
uh head over the

2923
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:39,679
control panel

2924
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:41,280
close this

2925
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:44,080
and you want to click this switch

2926
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,840
save it

2927
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,239
so the important thing is that

2928
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:50,000
the verified role is actually going to

2929
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,080
be the schmucks that just the default

2930
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,480
one basically what you the role that you

2931
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,080
want people to be when they first join

2932
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:57,600
the server

2933
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:58,560
um

2934
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,880
so yeah for us it's the schmucks that's

2935
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:03,040
who's gonna be the initial

2936
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:04,000
uh

2937
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,040
verified user

2938
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,000
um

2939
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,679
yeah once you have it on and everything

2940
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:12,560
and you go ahead and save it um now if i

2941
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,560
let's say i click

2942
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:17,040
on server if i go ahead and

2943
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,560
sorry i'm used to opening the

2944
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:21,040
application itself um

2945
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,679
go ahead and click general and um

2946
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:26,000
i don't know let's say

2947
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
i guess i already gave an example really

2948
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,239
how it works when you when you join a

2949
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,400
server and it doesn't let you

2950
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:36,159
see anything before you um

2951
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:37,440
before you

2952
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:38,960
verify yourself

2953
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:39,920
um

2954
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:43,199
it's for the control panel

2955
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,320
you already enabled the verification

2956
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,600
so it's going to have the same uh

2957
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,520
it's going to have the same uh like

2958
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:52,560
effects

2959
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,560
the thing is in order to make it so they

2960
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:56,480
can't see any text channels you need to

2961
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,560
go to the server settings and um

2962
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,800
so this is the verified role right

2963
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,639
but if when someone first joins they

2964
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:04,880
don't have that role

2965
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,840
so what you want to do is you want to um

2966
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,159
go over to the

2967
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:12,320
i believe it's the

2968
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,239
uh the default permissions and you want

2969
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:16,080
to make sure if you want to and what you

2970
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,440
wanted to be like the server i just

2971
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,719
showed you like where they can't see any

2972
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:20,320
text channels you could just make

2973
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:21,920
everyone which is when they first join

2974
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,280
without verifying that's where they're

2975
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,360
going to end up under those permissions

2976
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:27,360
you can just click view channels they

2977
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,960
can't see them anymore

2978
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:31,520
and so if you want to go ahead and see

2979
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:33,040
run through the um

2980
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,040
the verification yourself as well i'll

2981
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,400
go ahead and create an invite link for

2982
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:37,600
you

2983
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,040
and you can go ahead and try it out

2984
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,360
yourself

2985
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,400
uh i'm urban already sent one but if you

2986
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,480
haven't joined and or you could leave

2987
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,320
the server and you want to test it out

2988
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,880
and rejoin there's an invite link

2989
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,960
um

2990
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,239
yeah so that's how you add the

2991
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:55,920
verification

2992
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,080
um

2993
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:00,320
really

2994
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,239
i think crucial part of moderating

2995
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:05,199
especially a larger server you see here

2996
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:07,600
we have people saying no rules rules no

2997
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:08,880
moderation

2998
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,719
so you want people saying this you know

2999
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:14,239
kick and whatever you want to do

3000
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:16,080
i i just think it's a

3001
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,760
very important to have something to

3002
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:19,760
verify your users and also have an auto

3003
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:21,679
mod to really

3004
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:25,199
prevent spam and also

3005
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:26,719
keep your server you know from sending

3006
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:29,920
any any sort of like uh malicious uh i

3007
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:30,800
don't know

3008
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,040
links or

3009
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:34,800
you can also like you know any invite

3010
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,480
links to discord servers you don't want

3011
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,400
people to join those might be malicious

3012
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,320
as well not inherently by clicking on

3013
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,000
them but you know

3014
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,520
who knows what they're sending in the

3015
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,040
other ones

3016
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,280
um

3017
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:49,119
yeah

3018
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:50,719
so

3019
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:53,119
after adding this

3020
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:54,719
um

3021
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:57,679
we can actually make it so when someone

3022
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:00,080
joins

3023
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,880
obviously we saw the rules earlier but

3024
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,520
you can also add something here

3025
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:07,679
yourself and have your own so for me

3026
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:10,639
it's just going to be be nice and

3027
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:12,320
like we saw earlier there was a list of

3028
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:13,679
rules for me it's just going to say be

3029
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:14,480
nice

3030
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:17,119
and that's my only role on this server

3031
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:19,199
so far i think most people are being

3032
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:20,840
nice

3033
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:24,480
but i don't know i'll check it out later

3034
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,760
that's how that's how they ended up

3035
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:27,280
putting their rules in the verification

3036
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:28,719
page they just put it under this

3037
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:30,800
verification content this is where your

3038
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:33,760
verification verified page content

3039
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,239
um

3040
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:38,480
so

3041
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:42,239
what we can do from here is um

3042
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:44,639
show you how you can

3043
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:48,639
restrict access to certain channels

3044
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:52,159
and certain categories of channels

3045
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:55,440
uh so each each uh text channel has like

3046
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:59,199
a little gear next to them and

3047
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:01,040
um each one has their own settings and

3048
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,239
permissions

3049
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:04,239
um let's say i have an off topic and i

3050
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:06,320
want this to be strictly business for

3051
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:08,800
everyone except me and uh i don't know

3052
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,560
the rest of the admins or something i

3053
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,440
can get the off topic text channel and

3054
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,520
just edit the permissions

3055
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:19,600
uh make it a private channel and

3056
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,600
only the admin roles and i guess the

3057
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,119
bots can

3058
01:48:23,119 --> 01:48:25,440
view that text channel and if you're a

3059
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,880
part of this server right now you'll be

3060
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,719
able to see that you can't see this text

3061
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:33,040
channel yourself if you're not an admin

3062
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:35,679
so you know

3063
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:38,159
if you want to hide any text channels or

3064
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:39,760
you know you could hide voice channels

3065
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:40,880
as well

3066
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:44,480
same settings permissions

3067
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,960
this could help out to really uh

3068
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:49,280
separate every everything you want to

3069
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,280
have separated you could have like you

3070
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:53,440
can add new sections or you can edit

3071
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:56,719
specific sections like

3072
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,239
let's say i don't want people talking

3073
01:48:58,239 --> 01:48:59,920
outside of a certain role you can edit

3074
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:02,560
the category sorry not sections category

3075
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,639
the drop downs you can edit the

3076
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:06,960
categories and um edit the permissions

3077
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,760
of everything under that as well so if i

3078
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,119
wanted to make the voice channels

3079
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:13,119
private it would be the same thing make

3080
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:14,719
it private but i'm not i'm gonna keep it

3081
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:16,880
open for everyone because i want

3082
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:19,040
people to speak in my server outside of

3083
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,599
the admins

3084
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:23,440
so um

3085
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:26,480
if anyone has rejoined

3086
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:27,440
uh

3087
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:28,960
if anyone has joined the server you

3088
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,199
would actually see something right here

3089
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:32,800
under the roll it says schmucks right

3090
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,639
now but it would also say verified next

3091
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:38,320
to it uh because of the

3092
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:40,080
the discord bot

3093
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,440
already verified them and that's a way

3094
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,199
to check you know like whether they're

3095
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:44,960
verified i mean they are verified if

3096
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,159
they're already in the server and under

3097
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:48,719
schmucks but that's just a neat little

3098
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:50,960
thing

3099
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,759
and

3100
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:57,080
so

3101
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,760
the

3102
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,080
um

3103
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:03,840
all these things and all these bots are

3104
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,679
really like

3105
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:06,880
more

3106
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,840
uh useful for like big community bots

3107
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,119
like this i mean like you see this

3108
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:13,360
there's 152 people in this discord

3109
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:15,679
server so these are crucial

3110
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:19,040
crucial for you to um

3111
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:21,199
really have this uh

3112
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:24,480
server flowing well uh otherwise almost

3113
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:28,400
guarantee that it could be a mess um

3114
01:50:29,119 --> 01:50:31,280
yeah but if you're having just like a

3115
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:32,800
discord server with friends you don't

3116
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,800
really need these things they can be

3117
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,400
convenient of course

3118
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:38,239
especially in larger groups of people

3119
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:38,960
but

3120
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,400
um it was just like a community

3121
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,000
discourse server or like some sort of

3122
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,239
topic subject anything you want you know

3123
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:45,679
there's so there's discord servers for

3124
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:47,840
everything really

3125
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,440
there's some for you know specific

3126
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:52,239
programming languages specific jobs any

3127
01:50:52,239 --> 01:50:54,800
and some specific types of i don't know

3128
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,880
food really it's anything you can find

3129
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:57,679
but

3130
01:50:57,679 --> 01:51:00,000
um

3131
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:02,639
i think a lot of the times at least

3132
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:04,560
before there was a problem with uh

3133
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:06,880
having discord a discord account and uh

3134
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,440
managing your presence in each one so

3135
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:12,159
let's say you have a discord server that

3136
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:14,719
is more oriented for like maybe

3137
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:16,560
something a little more

3138
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,719
professional or i don't know but and

3139
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:20,639
then you have another one that's like uh

3140
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:22,560
let's say this one isn't something like

3141
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:24,960
that uh we're sending like sheep gifs

3142
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,000
and stuff

3143
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,920
um and that's like the whole purpose of

3144
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:30,560
it let's say that you can actually edit

3145
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,679
how you're uh viewed on this pro on the

3146
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:35,920
server by right clicking the server and

3147
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:38,480
clicking edit server profile

3148
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:39,599
and so

3149
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:41,520
when you're on the server yeah they can

3150
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,119
click on your on your account and

3151
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:45,440
eventually you know if your account

3152
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,119
allows it to which you can switch off in

3153
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:48,960
your personal settings they can see your

3154
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:50,880
actual username and everything but

3155
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,159
um

3156
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:54,159
if you edit your server profile

3157
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:57,440
um i'm gonna ign nickname myself uh

3158
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,360
folio here i'm not gonna change my

3159
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:00,880
picture

3160
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,360
go ahead and save it and now i'm brawlio

3161
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:04,960
under this but if you you could change

3162
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,719
your picture and it really helps with

3163
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:09,119
like you know if you don't want to be

3164
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:11,840
i guess identified in the same manner

3165
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,920
as you are identified in other discord

3166
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,760
servers that's a really convenient

3167
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:18,080
feature that has been added relatively

3168
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:20,480
recently

3169
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,679
yeah

3170
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:24,719
i think

3171
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:25,760
another

3172
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:27,440
big part of this really i haven't

3173
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,719
covered is uh

3174
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:31,599
your personal security on on discord uh

3175
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:33,760
and you're moderating like you know what

3176
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,760
people can see

3177
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,679
on your discord account so if you go to

3178
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:39,360
the bottom left

3179
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:41,840
find the gear

3180
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,280
you go to your account

3181
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:44,320
i think the first thing you want to

3182
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:47,840
check out is your privacy and safety

3183
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:49,760
safe direct messages automatically scan

3184
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,040
and delete direct messages you know

3185
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:53,440
explicit media content

3186
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:56,080
their server privacy defaults

3187
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,920
us direct messages from people and

3188
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,280
servers if you don't want that you want

3189
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:00,480
messages from people and servers that

3190
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,760
you don't have added you can switch that

3191
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:03,280
off

3192
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:06,239
allow access to nsfw servers on ios yeah

3193
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:08,400
you could have that offer on whatever

3194
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,080
you would like

3195
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:11,840
um who can add you as a friend i don't

3196
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,199
want everyone adding me as a friend

3197
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:15,760
maybe so i can switch that off

3198
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:17,280
friends of friends is fine server

3199
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:18,719
members is fine

3200
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:20,719
rich presents this one's a big one um if

3201
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:22,639
you are in a game

3202
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:24,400
uh any sort of video game on that

3203
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,159
computer that you have that discord

3204
01:53:26,159 --> 01:53:27,360
server on

3205
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,280
if you have this on people can join your

3206
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:31,599
game through discord uh without sending

3207
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:33,599
a request or anything so typically

3208
01:53:33,599 --> 01:53:35,440
people want to have this soft but some

3209
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,119
people don't uh it really depends how

3210
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:38,880
you use your discord account and how

3211
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,400
where you use it

3212
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:41,440
um

3213
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:42,880
and same thing like if you're in the

3214
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,360
same voice channel as someone else um

3215
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,760
they can join your your uh game through

3216
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:50,639
discord as well

3217
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,440
but you can switch that off and you know

3218
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,040
here it's uh

3219
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:57,199
for how discord uses your data if you

3220
01:53:57,199 --> 01:53:58,639
don't want discord

3221
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:02,000
uh using your data to improve discord or

3222
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,080
use data to customize your discord

3223
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:06,080
experience

3224
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:08,800
you can switch that off um

3225
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,880
you can also ask for

3226
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,880
you could also request your data

3227
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:16,000
get a copy of your personal data

3228
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:16,880
just

3229
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:17,920
could be

3230
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:19,679
something interesting for a lot of

3231
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:20,639
people

3232
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:23,119
um

3233
01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:25,040
the big thing though really is that the

3234
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,639
two enabling your two-factor

3235
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:28,880
authentication i feel like that's very

3236
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,719
crucial to

3237
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:32,719
um really having a secure discord

3238
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:34,000
account and i recommend everyone who

3239
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,360
creates a discord account does that um

3240
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:39,440
really all it's a very simple process

3241
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:41,920
you you type in your password ask for

3242
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:42,960
like

3243
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:46,639
um your authentication code you know use

3244
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:49,440
your authentic authenticator app to

3245
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:51,280
have your codes ready for whenever you

3246
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:53,199
log in from a different device or if you

3247
01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:55,040
log in ever

3248
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:56,639
and i recommend you do that and you know

3249
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,560
some discord servers require you to have

3250
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:00,480
two factor enabled and you can do that

3251
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,400
for use as well like i demonstrated

3252
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:03,280
earlier

3253
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:06,560
um and this is a it's a big

3254
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:07,679
it's a

3255
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:10,159
it's a big thing a big requirement a lot

3256
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:11,599
of people don't actually have theirs

3257
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:13,440
verified i recommend you do

3258
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:16,719
um you know the lowest one is that uh

3259
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:18,800
you have your verified email but if you

3260
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,560
want them to have two factor and you

3261
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:23,119
know make sure 100 that this account

3262
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:25,840
belongs to this person and is used

3263
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,360
uh

3264
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,280
in a

3265
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,520
trustworthy manner i guess or you just

3266
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:32,960
want them maybe you just want your users

3267
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,199
to be secure users

3268
01:55:35,199 --> 01:55:36,239
you could have it on the highest

3269
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:38,320
moderation setting

3270
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:39,440
um

3271
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:40,320
and

3272
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:43,920
i'd advise to at least have it at medium

3273
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:44,639
or

3274
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:47,280
at least low don't have it completely

3275
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:48,880
off because that can lead to some

3276
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,119
problems and like i said before you know

3277
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:53,440
especially in bigger servers

3278
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:55,759
um

3279
01:55:56,639 --> 01:55:57,679
i believe

3280
01:55:57,679 --> 01:55:58,480
that

3281
01:55:58,480 --> 01:55:59,679
when you

3282
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:02,800
have all these things enabled it really

3283
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:05,040
it can lead to a much better experience

3284
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:08,000
on discord because i mean before

3285
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,840
if without taking these things into

3286
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:12,480
account any like discord

3287
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:15,840
um bots or you know personal safety like

3288
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:16,639
that

3289
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:18,320
um

3290
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:20,560
and privacy and

3291
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:21,760
you know

3292
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:25,199
the connections and everything uh it can

3293
01:56:25,199 --> 01:56:27,040
it can be a bit it's a completely

3294
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:29,280
different experience really um there are

3295
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:31,599
authorized apps

3296
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:33,119
and connections

3297
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:35,199
authorized apps i authorize the bots you

3298
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:37,920
know but also the connections i think is

3299
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:40,239
a big thing because discord is really

3300
01:56:40,239 --> 01:56:42,719
convenient when it comes to these

3301
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:45,280
connections that i'm showing here

3302
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:48,080
a lot of these things are like

3303
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:50,560
if you use these things

3304
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,960
with discord it can be very convenient

3305
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:55,199
you can use github reddit but maybe you

3306
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:57,679
don't want these things um

3307
01:56:57,679 --> 01:56:58,960
you know displayed on your discord

3308
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:02,480
account which i completely understand

3309
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:04,880
before discord connects any of your

3310
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:07,040
accounts it'll ask you if you want it

3311
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:09,119
connected so

3312
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:11,280
connecting your spotify it'll it'll ask

3313
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:13,199
you before it'll it'll show like a

3314
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:15,040
little bar at the top to see if you want

3315
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,639
to connect your spotify account with

3316
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:17,920
your discord and people can see what

3317
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:19,360
you're listening to

3318
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,400
or

3319
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,159
yeah stuff like that it works with all

3320
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:24,480
these applications how they uh

3321
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:26,400
you know respectively how they how they

3322
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,000
function they can function within

3323
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,239
discord or interact in a certain manner

3324
01:57:30,239 --> 01:57:32,080
um i personally don't like to connect my

3325
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,639
discord with different applications uh

3326
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:38,560
can get a bit messy i don't know

3327
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,480
but

3328
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:43,519
yeah um

3329
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:45,119
i think

3330
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:47,599
overall i think discord

3331
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:48,880
um

3332
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:50,480
really sh

3333
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,320
with all these moderation steps in mind

3334
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:55,119
i think you can lead to a very

3335
01:57:55,119 --> 01:57:58,159
good and secure experience um only thing

3336
01:57:58,159 --> 01:58:00,159
really is that there is no end-to-end

3337
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:01,679
encryption between messages and i

3338
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:03,679
believe the biggest reason for that is

3339
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:06,800
okay it's a free service so you know

3340
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,480
maybe probably

3341
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:10,400
data is taken

3342
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:11,840
but you know you could turn it off

3343
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:13,360
obviously in the settings i'll let you

3344
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:15,199
but you know it's still there's still no

3345
01:58:15,199 --> 01:58:17,520
end-to-end encryption so uh

3346
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,679
the thing is when you when you're dming

3347
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:22,080
someone or anything like that you can

3348
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:23,840
report specific

3349
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:25,199
messages

3350
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:27,199
um and this is uh

3351
01:58:27,199 --> 01:58:29,040
i can't report the spot but

3352
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:30,800
i'm not sure where i can find an example

3353
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,960
but it allows you to report specific

3354
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,719
messages in different servers or like

3355
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:37,199
directly to you and

3356
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:40,000
um i'm guessing that's like

3357
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,920
two conflicting things of course i think

3358
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:45,920
end-to-end encryption would be um

3359
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:47,840
honestly a great feature to add a

3360
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:49,760
discord but

3361
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:51,760
that's the that's what it is missing

3362
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:53,119
it's just i believe it's just standard

3363
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:56,239
encryption for discord so

3364
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:57,679
yeah that's uh i guess that's something

3365
01:58:57,679 --> 01:58:59,840
you can differentiate it but you can

3366
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:02,159
compare with like

3367
01:59:02,159 --> 01:59:04,800
slack i believe slack may have intent

3368
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:07,280
encryption

3369
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,239
so

3370
01:59:10,239 --> 01:59:13,360
i think uh what i'd like to do now is uh

3371
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:15,360
let's try to get if you have a discord

3372
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:16,719
account we already have like three

3373
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:17,920
people on the discord but i really

3374
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:19,840
encourage you to join this right now

3375
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:22,400
um because i want to exemplify really

3376
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:23,679
like

3377
01:59:23,679 --> 01:59:25,679
um

3378
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:28,159
the the problems that you might run into

3379
01:59:28,159 --> 01:59:29,199
if

3380
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:31,040
let's say

3381
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:33,440
you add a bot that

3382
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:35,280
doesn't end up being

3383
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:37,920
actually trustworthy

3384
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:39,360
um

3385
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:40,239
and so

3386
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:42,239
first i'd like to thank uh miguel bias

3387
01:59:42,239 --> 01:59:43,360
for

3388
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:46,480
uh letting uh meet us use uh the discord

3389
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:49,920
bot that he created um which actually

3390
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:51,280
does something that i guess you could

3391
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:52,880
consider

3392
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:54,400
a bit malicious but it's just a little

3393
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,719
demo example it's not anything that we

3394
01:59:56,719 --> 01:59:58,480
actually used or anything

3395
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,239
so

3396
02:00:00,239 --> 02:00:03,840
here i have the discord bot link

3397
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,920
and if i want to add it to a discord

3398
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:07,679
server let's say look this is just a bot

3399
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:08,560
demo

3400
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:10,159
um

3401
02:00:10,159 --> 02:00:12,080
it seems innocent enough it has a happy

3402
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:13,920
little bot in the picture and i trust it

3403
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,520
and it's recommended and a couple a

3404
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:17,119
couple people use it from the website

3405
02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:18,960
that i'm looking at but if i add it to

3406
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,239
my server

3407
02:00:20,239 --> 02:00:21,119
and

3408
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:24,840
i or some of you if you have someone as

3409
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:28,080
a as an administrator on your server and

3410
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,520
they add it to the server because you

3411
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:30,880
know they have the permission to do that

3412
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:32,159
to do that

3413
02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:33,920
um

3414
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:36,080
you really need to make sure who you you

3415
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:37,360
uh check who you're giving

3416
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:40,320
administrative uh powers to because

3417
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:42,560
let's say i'm not the server owner and i

3418
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:44,960
i decide to add a bot

3419
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:48,239
and it doesn't have to be on purpose um

3420
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:50,080
but you know

3421
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:51,440
you need to add people that you can

3422
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:53,599
trust because

3423
02:00:53,599 --> 02:00:54,960
it can lead to a lot of problems it

3424
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:56,239
could completely lock you out of your

3425
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:58,000
own server

3426
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,599
okay i can't find the trains apparently

3427
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:02,239
motorbus

3428
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:09,840
one second

3429
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:13,679
i can't tell what that is

3430
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:15,199
okay that's good enough

3431
02:01:15,199 --> 02:01:17,440
i added this a new bot to my discord

3432
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:18,960
server and

3433
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:20,719
it's called coolbot

3434
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:23,199
innocent enough not verified

3435
02:01:23,199 --> 02:01:25,520
not all unverified discord bots are

3436
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:28,239
malicious but if someone is to add a bot

3437
02:01:28,239 --> 02:01:31,360
to your server um

3438
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:33,280
they can really just it really just

3439
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:34,840
takes one command

3440
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:36,480
to

3441
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:37,599
just

3442
02:01:37,599 --> 02:01:40,400
lock everything out

3443
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,480
so here i ran the bot

3444
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:45,280
and it actually made it so

3445
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:47,119
it created a new text channel and locked

3446
02:01:47,119 --> 02:01:49,360
out every single text channel and voice

3447
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:50,960
channel

3448
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:53,360
for anyone that's not an ad

3449
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:54,800
and this could be it could end up being

3450
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:57,119
a lot worse actually if the bot has

3451
02:01:57,119 --> 02:01:58,320
permissions

3452
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:00,719
or it's granted permissions above what

3453
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:02,400
you have you can be locked out of your

3454
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:04,560
own server as well it completely takes

3455
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:05,920
over essentially

3456
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:06,960
um

3457
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:08,480
this is the only text channel you can

3458
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:10,800
type in now which it's called purgatory

3459
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:12,239
so

3460
02:02:12,239 --> 02:02:13,280
yeah

3461
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:14,719
everything else as you can see it's

3462
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:18,080
locked out so text is limited for

3463
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:19,280
everything

3464
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:21,360
can't access anything yeah

3465
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:24,320
bots can be

3466
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:27,360
you know used for malicious intent

3467
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:28,960
um so you really have to be careful with

3468
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:30,480
what you use but

3469
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,320
generally they're actually a great thing

3470
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:34,320
to add to your servers and

3471
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:37,280
highly recommend that you use them

3472
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:39,199
um

3473
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:42,000
i think now uh

3474
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,360
maybe i'll take some questions

3475
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:46,960
anything that

3476
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:48,719
you want me to show

3477
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:50,960
or

3478
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:53,920
maybe describe for me and

3479
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:56,639
the people with me

3480
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:02,159
any thoughts on discord ui

3481
02:03:02,159 --> 02:03:04,639
interface uh its settings

3482
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:08,199
anything like that

3483
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:21,840
okay well um i believe this

3484
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:24,080
really concludes our

3485
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:25,520
uh discord

3486
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:27,199
presentation discord security

3487
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:29,440
presentation

3488
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:30,719
i hope uh

3489
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:31,840
i

3490
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:34,400
helped some of you learn uh

3491
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,080
how to properly

3492
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:38,560
keep your discord servers and accounts

3493
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:39,599
safe

3494
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:40,960
um

3495
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:43,360
and yeah so let me know if you have any

3496
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:45,679
