disaster you have the

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,799
people that come in first search and

like that first responders

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
we typically come in a little bit later

93
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,799
and uh

94
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,080
help with a lot of the long-term

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,519
recovery efforts of that particular

96
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,640
region

97
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,799
um we work a lot with uh different

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,599
you know with with fema with local local

99
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,879
emergency management people with bow ads

100
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,720
and we're kind of like geek squads for

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
geek squad for those companies for lack

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,720
of a better term

103
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,239
this is a slightly old stat we're about

104
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,720
2700 now

105
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,439
people so a lot of these people are i.t

106
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,239
people like

107
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,200
yourselves um you know a lot of kind of

108
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,879
general i.t skills

109
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,238
we go into an area uh and

110
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,079
you know help set up networks help set

111
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,839
up printers help set up

112
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,839
all sorts of things like that so that

113
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,280
people can kind of

114
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,240
start rebuilding a community um i'm

115
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,440
gonna have to tell you guys but

116
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,720
communications often

117
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
is the biggest thing you need in order

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,320
to start coordinating these sorts of

119
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,639
things

120
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,240
and this gives you an idea of kind of

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,479
how much we've grown in the last year

122
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,680
uh we had a project um

123
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,120
we had something called project connect

124
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,680
which we started uh bringing

125
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,960
uh wi-fi uh hotspots to

126
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
kids so that they could do homework and

127
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,720
also create white supply hot spots

128
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,520
in um for clinics and mobile clinics

129
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,800
vaccination sites

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,560
and we did over a thousand this last

131
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
year with all you know

132
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,560
hodgepodge of i.t donations that we got

133
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,600
from people in

134
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,680
industry so here's kind of a

135
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,800
high-level breakdown of what we do

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,759
uh in kind of the order we first

137
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,800
prioritize

138
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,560
life safety so you know police fire ems

139
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,639
emergency managers anyone like that who

140
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,560
needs something from us we we help them

141
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,039
first

142
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,880
in a disaster uh their next priority

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
is then mass care so think of like the

144
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,120
uh the red cross shelters

145
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,720
um things like that but they might stand

146
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
up at a fair ground mass feeding

147
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,840
i don't know if you guys have heard of

148
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,639
uh of a

149
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,160
mobile world kit or world central

150
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,240
kitchen uh we work closely with with

151
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,759
groups like that

152
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,520
um and then just kind of the community

153
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,840
recovery long-term recovery so

154
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,360
you know setting up things like like

155
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,280
churches and boads and

156
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,120
places like that that will be in an area

157
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
and they're you know offering food and

158
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,759
services

159
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,000
for the people um you know they don't

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,840
they often don't have it i.t

161
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,240
people or they need particular equipment

162
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,400
or or whatever and we'll kind of help

163
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,120
bridge them through those times

164
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,560
any questions kind of like a bad or what

165
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,039
what this means or what i.t means in

166
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,160
these different

167
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,840
contexts or anything like that

168
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,319
here's kind of a really high level

169
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,240
overview of kind of where we have

170
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,639
operations as you can see we have a lot

171
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,000
there in puerto rico from

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,960
hurricane maria a lot there in the gulf

173
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,160
coast in the gulf coast

174
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
there in texas um

175
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,400
a lot in new mexico and uh pacific

176
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,560
northwest and also in virginia that's a

177
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,000
lot of the covid

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,960
uh 19 sites that we've been uh working

179
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
on

180
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,560
um you know we really depend on a lot of

181
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,919
local people

182
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,160
there to to help us scale particularly

183
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,440
when there's something local

184
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,280
uh you know like a particular disaster

185
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
that's outside of our footprint

186
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,840
um so yeah if you guys if you guys want

187
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,080
to get active we'll probably be have a

188
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,000
have a really crazy fire season this

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,120
next year and

190
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,639
uh definitely be uh be busy

191
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,960
particularly here in northern california

192
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
so here's a list of some of our

193
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,479
capabilities um

194
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,880
we align ourselves across the 10 regions

195
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,919
that are

196
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,240
that are in the united states that fema

197
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
has so our regions kind of map

198
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,840
to theirs we have a lot of mims

199
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,759
class vehicles and mobile command

200
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,560
centers um

201
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,080
those of you that know about emergency

202
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,599
management know that you know different

203
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,960
lens classes have

204
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,800
different capabilities um we also have a

205
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
critical information systems team so

206
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,960
this is a group that people who've been

207
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,800
vetted and maybe they have particular

208
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
particular skills and they'll work with

209
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,960
uh with some of the emergency responders

210
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,919
on more sensitive

211
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,319
critical stuff here's a list of the

212
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,199
assets

213
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,240
that we distribute it's completely free

214
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,560
no charge to the community we we get it

215
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
free we give it free

216
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,720
you can't buy our stuff or anything like

217
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
that

218
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,400
a lot of what you see you know notebooks

219
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
tablets workstations that sort of thing

220
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,280
printers are really big

221
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,919
obviously in an area where you know

222
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,440
people are printing off maps and things

223
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,039
like that and have limited connectivity

224
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:21,919
we have uh

225
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,280
relationships with a lot of the big

226
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,120
manufacturers and satellite companies um

227
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,120
and then sometimes we need you know

228
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,800
radios and repeaters depending on kind

229
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,399
of how how bad

230
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,000
uh conditions are um

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,399
this is this is one that i worked in a

232
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,599
campfire up in

233
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,799
chico with the silver dollar fairground

234
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,560
we do a lot of stuff for survivors of

235
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,360
these wildfires

236
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,800
anything and everything you can imagine

237
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,519
connectivity wise so for example

238
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,399
um you know if a family you've lost

239
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,760
everything you've got to fill out

240
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,519
insurance paperwork you've got to

241
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,080
uh keep your kids entertained with

242
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,720
netflix you've got to

243
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,880
you know you name it wi-fi is kind of

244
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,760
the

245
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
thing that keeps it all together so we

246
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,240
help with a lot of surge

247
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,600
um a lot of surge stuff in these

248
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,680
um in these scenarios so you know

249
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,760
a fair ground may not have enough access

250
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,200
points to support all these people or

251
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,640
the bandwidth that we come in and kind

252
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
of create some of that stuff

253
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,120
to help them get through the get through

254
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,000
the recovery period

255
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,200
and uh yeah we work closely with ngos um

256
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
world central kitchen was kind of one of

257
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,160
the other ones i had mentioned before

258
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,760
there's team rubicon

259
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,120
there's several others that i'm sure you

260
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,959
guys uh familiar with red cross et

261
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,000
cetera

262
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,040
um we're we're often kind of the glue

263
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,680
that binds you know different things

264
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,240
together

265
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,959
where different i.t talent doesn't have

266
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,080
something or

267
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,480
maybe there's a gap of what the isp can

268
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,399
provide or something that their i.t

269
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,440
people can provide and we just kind of

270
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,480
figure it out as we go and help where we

271
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,560
can

272
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,360
um yeah some of the stuff i mentioned

273
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
before internet connectivity network

274
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,920
infrastructure

275
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,600
call centers radios a lot of computer

276
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,240
hardware

277
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,320
kind of helping people bridge the gap

278
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,800
and then we also have some um some

279
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,240
mobile command centers

280
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,480
that will bring if the situation calls

281
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,440
for it and

282
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,760
there's a lot of people who uh a lot of

283
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,880
different groups that will come and we

284
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,480
can all kind of work together on

285
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,519
coordinating different logistics this

286
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,320
was one of the

287
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,079
pictures that we took at one of our

288
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,600
training events

289
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,440
in san francisco area at google

290
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,839
we have about one of these a year but

291
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,880
last year we

292
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,360
we kind of shifted and had more smaller

293
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,720
ones virtually

294
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,560
um they just had one this last week um

295
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,200
but yeah if you guys join and you come

296
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
to one of these there will be a lot of

297
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,279
you know setting up gear cable cutting a

298
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,279
lot of safety big emphasis on safety in

299
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,640
the field

300
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,720
role playing what to do in different

301
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,000
scenarios

302
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,440
uh that sort of thing it's a lot of fun

303
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,600
a little bit more about our capabilities

304
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,760
kind of mostly what i covered

305
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,920
um this was a point-to-point shot that

306
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,200
we had done in uh

307
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,360
in michigan uh you can see they're

308
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,480
hanging something on

309
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,279
on this uh it's like a grain silo or

310
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,200
something

311
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
this is one i did here in santa cruz

312
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,399
with the czu fires

313
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,640
this is actually a campground on the

314
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,480
right that's one of our

315
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
volunteers climbed up on a pole was

316
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,079
putting of access point before this they

317
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,200
had just had a cow

318
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,880
and a uh uh cult

319
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,959
the what do you guys know what cows are

320
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,240
they're still on wheels but they bring

321
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,800
them in

322
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,760
you know for to give people uh internet

323
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,519
access whenever there's not a

324
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,000
tower in that area that was kind of

325
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,920
overloaded so we brought in our

326
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,639
own access points and uh worked with the

327
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,240
local list to get some more

328
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
bandwidth for the area and then kind of

329
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,360
tied it all together for the

330
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,800
for the people and um

331
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,480
yeah when we did in washington as you

332
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
can see there's there's starlink we hung

333
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,639
our stuff behind that

334
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,760
um a response we did for hurricane laura

335
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,920
this is another one i was part of uh in

336
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,120
the mendocino fire

337
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,519
complex all these are firemen they had

338
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,120
been working all day

339
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,440
and uh came back and at least had wi-fi

340
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,480
they could you know

341
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,440
text their families and um tell their

342
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,720
kids good night and stuff like that

343
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
that's

344
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,920
often really important to these guys

345
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,279
when they're doing this sort of thing in

346
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,079
the field

347
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,279
charging station huge deal um

348
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,000
and uh

349
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,320
yeah satellites will often get these

350
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,160
satellites aggregate them together

351
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,000
use some sort of sd-wan or traffic

352
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600
aggregation tool

353
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
to to to do this so that you know one

354
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
satellite can go down and another one

355
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,760
will uh we'll pick it up

356
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,760
and uh yeah typical charging station

357
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,720
and we're also starting to do drone um

358
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,600
drone

359
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,480
uh mapping and we work with different uh

360
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,920
law enforcement

361
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,240
to kind of map out an area send the

362
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,399
results to uh uh

363
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,720
them you know this is kind of important

364
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,639
too for survivors to be able to start

365
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,079
the insurance paperwork they have to

366
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,720
show that they're that they're uh

367
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,360
that they lost their property you can't

368
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,959
you start that paperwork until you can

369
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:33,440
prove

370
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,320
that you know what the damage was so one

371
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,240
of the guys who's on our team is an

372
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,199
ex-googler

373
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,399
and uh he donates his time to

374
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,279
um to to basically getting all this

375
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,000
stuff

376
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,760
all this footage and then we imported

377
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,120
into to

378
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,480
it to esri and then let the

379
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,839
different emergency managers start

380
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,279
picking through it and assessing the

381
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,120
damage

382
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,720
the point the point we did up in

383
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,480
washington

384
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,079
and this is uh our copic response

385
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,440
uh numbers actually they look a little

386
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,639
bit better than this but you can see

387
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,199
kind of

388
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,440
the three main areas that we had were

389
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,360
rural areas of washington new mexico and

390
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,639
pennsylvania

391
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,000
a lot of libraries uh schools uh

392
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,160
housing projects you know that sort of

393
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,399
thing

394
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,639
and that's basically it guys i don't

395
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,320
want to i don't want to take too much

396
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,680
time of the other presenter and leave it

397
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,079
open

398
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,519
also leave it open for questions in case

399
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,440
you guys have some

400
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,240
well that's really important work roger

401
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,480
thanks for sharing all those pictures

402
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,680
i do have a question who pays for you

403
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,519
guys when you have to travel to

404
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,000
different

405
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,639
locations

406
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,199
so yeah when we when we go uh the

407
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,720
volunteers don't pay anything

408
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,279
we'll go raise funds for the for the

409
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,199
volunteers to do that

410
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,160
so the answer is never the volunteer

411
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,760
that's the answer

412
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,839
okay awesome this particular picture is

413
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,079
of

414
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,000
uh uh the campfire uh everyone here is

415
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,120
from california right you guys know

416
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,680
about the campfire up in paradise

417
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,800
um all these people brought gifts

418
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,320
and you know you think gifts are an

419
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,000
awesome thing gifts are actually a huge

420
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,800
pain in the butt

421
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,880
to to manage and to process and

422
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,399
everything like that so

423
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,880
you know we'll often work with these

424
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,800
places in kind of documenting what all

425
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,760
the things are

426
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
creating some sort of a database there's

427
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,880
a lot of ad hoc

428
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,240
tools that we'll figure out for them um

429
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,000
you know you'd be surprised inventory is

430
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,720
just a huge part of this

431
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,160
um and then all the item stuff that goes

432
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,720
along

433
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,000
with with that there's another oh yeah

434
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,759
these are the scanners that we used to

435
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,920
start tagging the different boxes we got

436
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,279
a whole bunch of them and

437
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,800
started putting them in a spreadsheet oh

438
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
it looks like google yeah google's even

439
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,519
open there

440
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,440
and then just kind of offloaded that

441
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,199
from some of the the police and fire

442
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,040
and yeah there's some of the survivor

443
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,639
sites that that they stayed at while

444
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,600
there

445
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,279
um this is the red cross there in silver

446
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,759
dollar this is kind of a network map we

447
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,560
had made

448
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,959
and this was kind of a long-term project

449
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,320
there were several different groups up

450
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,600
there that came up to

451
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,160
to help for the next year or two and we

452
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,079
just offered a bunch of ip

453
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,079
stuff that they needed um

454
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,160
anyway quick summary of kind of the

455
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
different things and assets we have

456
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,959
and uh if you guys want to know more go

457
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:27,959
to itv

458
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,000
ipdrc.org and if you have questions you

459
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,040
can just email

460
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,880
info itdrc.org and um

461
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,160
yeah happy to tell you guys more

462
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,079
okay can i ask a quick question

463
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,199
yeah you just did you want to ask

464
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,360
another one oh yes i asked two quick

465
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,160
questions yes

466
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
um uh how closely do you work with on

467
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,160
the workforce development boards

468
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
and i asked that because locally in

469
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,160
santa cruz they were very active with a

470
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,000
lot of cleanup and the rescue efforts

471
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
but i don't know

472
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,839
how they connected with you guys and

473
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,160
then

474
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,319
they offer you know supplemental um

475
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,959
payments uh the students and various

476
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,280
people can sign up to you know earn to

477
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,760
help out with the recovery effort but

478
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,280
was it necessarily connected with you

479
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,240
guys and

480
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,760
you know that's something that we would

481
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,520
like to get our students connected with

482
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,559
but

483
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,160
yeah anyways well uh we don't

484
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,000
i mean we don't take any payment you

485
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,840
can't really buy our services you can't

486
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,559
buy our

487
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,480
stuff or anything so i mean if people

488
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
are wanting to get paid this is probably

489
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,280
not the best way to

490
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
to do it you know the workforce but it's

491
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,320
a good way it's a good

492
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,919
yeah it's a good way to get skills and a

493
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,760
good way to you know

494
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,360
flex and show how awesome you are to the

495
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,200
community which you can maybe translate

496
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,000
to a job

497
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,799
a lot of people use it for a job more in

498
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,440
partnership

499
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,799
so then they would just go ahead you

500
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,640
directly as an individual workforce

501
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,000
development board perhaps this is an

502
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,080
email i should send you

503
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,440
yeah yeah i don't know much about the

504
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,280
workforce development stuff and

505
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,120
i haven't really seen too many of them

506
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,360
in

507
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,280
in uh these things we typically work

508
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,960
with more volunteer groups

509
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
if you can tell us about what they are

510
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,320
denise just

511
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,720
just to create an awareness um the

512
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,320
workforce development boards are

513
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,240
essentially your one stop centers in the

514
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,280
the counties they

515
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,679
uh uh they handle all of the uh the

516
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,679
federal money coming down workforce

517
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,840
investment act

518
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,960
wioa i think that's what it was called

519
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,039
opportunity act anyways it's federal

520
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,400
assistance that comes to the local

521
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,240
counties for adults who are needing

522
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,919
retraining or employment

523
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,240
for youth um you know fairly fairly

524
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,320
large programs and um

525
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,200
all the higher ed and k-12s were all

526
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,559
supposed to be connected and working

527
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,640
together and this is an area where

528
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,280
it looks like we could be um working a

529
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,440
little bit closer at least locally and

530
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,760
since there are fires going on right now

531
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,799
in our area

532
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,240
um you know that's something i think

533
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
we'll be jumping into again in the

534
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
future

535
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,240
a lot of what we do is we help the

536
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,679
places that don't have

537
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,039
this sort of thing i mean i think it's

538
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,799
awesome if you do have a place with

539
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,919
money being dumped in

540
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,720
i think for every you know thing that's

541
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,880
declared a federal disaster it's

542
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,039
i see i've seen stats that only like one

543
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,559
percent of things are declared a federal

544
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,600
disaster so

545
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,280
a lot of our efforts go into these other

546
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,799
communities smaller communities that

547
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,919
don't have

548
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,280
this sort of thing and that seems to be

549
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,520
sometimes where our time and money is

550
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,880
as well is better spent okay and i'd

551

love to connect with you denise

552
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,080

554

578
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,080
um so hi my name is irvin

579
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,720
i run the cyber competitions program for

580
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,480
the bay area

581
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,919
with me are the students that i hired

582
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,120
to be part of the admin team it's these

583
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,960
students who create contests

584
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,600
who execute them who do the research who

585
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,520
get that hands-on

586
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,960
industry level experience that has

587
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,440
proven to help them get ready for the

588
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,480
real world

589
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,919
what this program does is it

590
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,080
it shows middle school high school

591
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
community college students the world of

592
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,360
cyber security

593
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,080
in a way that's accessible to them so we

594
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,039
create

595
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,240
training materials for them we provide

596
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,600
resources so if a school

597
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
wants to join us and they have nothing

598
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,440
but chromebooks we provide

599
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,600
everything that they need to participate

600
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,320
we provide mentorship to those students

601
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,039
we help them get started in the field

602
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,400
one of the big things

603
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,080
one of the big visions behind it is at

604
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,240
the very least we make students safer

605
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,440
than when they started with us and at

606
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,000
the very best they start their career

607
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,919
in cyber security we have been around

608
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,840
since 2016 and it started as

609
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,600
just a summer camp following a very

610
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,360
specific curriculum

611
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,039
and uh as uh the

612
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,000
as it grew i was given more more

613
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,159
leniency and what what we can do with it

614
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,559
and i once i had enough leniency i

615
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,760
turned it around

616
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,760
and exploded the the program uh i had

617
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,600
i needed help in that explosion and

618
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,520
that's where denise moss came in

619
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,679
she has been my right hand since helping

620
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,280
me with all the administrative and

621
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,799
operations side

622
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,720
working with the colleges because i'm a

623
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,159
technical person

624
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,600
you know i i understand the technical

625
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,880
side in and out

626
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
and i have the vision and creativity for

627
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,440
that but when it comes to

628
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,240
uh when it comes to the organization

629
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,799
side

630
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,640
with the bay area colleges and all that

631
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,400
that's where denise comes in and really

632
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,000
helps me

633
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,520
make sure everything everything's still

634
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,360
going well on that

635
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,799
on that end and then with that i

636
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,440
brought in students to help design and

637
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,000
build and

638
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,120
run uh all the various contests

639
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,360
in the bay area so i'm gonna introduce

640
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,960
them

641
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,880
and they can they'll talk a bit about

642
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,400
themselves and and we have some

643
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,240
questions

644
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,640
uh for them so the first person that i'm

645
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,960
gonna introduce is brandon

646
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,760
he joined us as a high schooler in 2018

647
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,039
17 i believe 17.

648
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,320
uh hi yeah um like he said

649
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,440
i have been with the team for

650
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,640
about three years i i ended this january

651
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,960
to pursue bigger and better things but

652
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
working with them during the summer was

653
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,600
my first introduction to cyber security

654
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,720
which eventually led into an

655
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,840
apprenticeship with

656
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,080
a forensic expert that was local to

657
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,200
santa cruz

658
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
and from there i built up my knowledge

659
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,600
built up my experience and eventually

660
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,159
landed

661
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,960
a full-time job as of yesterday actually

662
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,440
so

663
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,200
uh a lot of really good things to say

664
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,880
about this team and we'll get into that

665
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,279
but

666
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,400
that's me and the next person i want to

667
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,120

um i grew up in singapore during my time

671
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,600
there i became a paramilitary

672
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,520
firefighter for about two years

673
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,559
um before i moved on back over

674
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,520
midway through 2017 uh which is when i

675
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,960
joined in by the way

676
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,240
um yeah uh

677
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,000
roger i saw some of the stuff earlier

678
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,600
that was super cool i like the

679
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,440
the tent setup you had there i do have

680
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,039
memories of sleeping in a

681
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,080
cement uh stairwell from an apartment uh

682
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,200
because that was across from where our

683
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,279
fire was to take a quick breather

684
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,840
um yeah we we uh we were told to give

685
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,320
everyone

686
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,000
everyone internet except the prisoners

687
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,520
they didn't need wi-fi

688
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,640
whatever we did um

689
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
but yeah after that i i joined in

690
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,640
cabrillo to start my education

691
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,679
and i think within my first semester at

692
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,520
cabrillo i was working for irvin

693
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,120
um i was really interested in the topic

694
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,320
you know i'd already pursued cyber

695
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,440
security

696
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,880
uh like theory and education on my own

697
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,000
time

698
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
um but you know i was i was starting

699
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,600
that path at cabrillo

700
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,080
and being able to work in it uh really

701
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,840
helps me branch out with that

702
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,640
um granted i am also ending my sins with

703
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,360
irvin

704
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,720
uh after this this year's summer camp

705
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,640
um because i am transferring over to

706
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,919
sfsu

707
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,080
uh to hopefully get a four-year degree

708
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,840
uh and i think that's about all i will

709
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,120
say for now

710
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,840
yeah cool cool uh next introduces ryan

711
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,840
hello um i see it um

712
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,559
i used to um study astrophysics

713
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,640
mostly for me but i really started

714
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,480
getting into math of it

715
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,080
and i was pursuing that for about four

716
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,640
years

717
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,960
now i was told i have to take a class

718
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,320
programming

719
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,760
and i realized that i like computers a

720
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,400
lot more than i like math um

721
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,679
and i came back to career um

722
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,520
uh when i moved home uh after a bit

723
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,799
high school um and uh

724
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,320
basically ingers in cyber security

725
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,520
um in my first class at uh rio

726
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,919
in cyber security i was just like this

727
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,520
is what i want to do

728
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,640
um and you know ever pick me up

729
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,080
uh getting honest he showed me that

730
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,320
this is way better than whatever i

731
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,840
wanted before

732
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,960
um so i'm still a little new um

733
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,799

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,679
back

745
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,760
i've been doing i used to do a lot of

746
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,640
like military related programs as a kid

747
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,720
i started at eight years old in this

748
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
program called young marines

749
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,520
um i did that for a few years up until

750
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,559
high school

751
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,320
and then in high school i joined uh

752
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,399
junior rotc so

753
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,640
i was really like focused on this and i

754
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,720
like really wanted to go that route

755
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,760
so i i kept going and i ended up getting

756
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,320
into

757
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,520

759
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,679
2018 and uh going in there

760
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,919
you know after like half of the first

761
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,960
semester

762
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,760
i decided that if i keep pursuing this i

763
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,399
was gonna

764
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,640
just i mean i was only gonna know

765
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,000
military and the military

766
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,640
lifestyle and to me at that point i was

767
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,760
like okay i need a change in pace

768
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,559
um ended up leaving actually ended up

769
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,039
going

770
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,840
to santa cruz after that and then joined

771
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,120
cabrillo

772
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,799
i was at cabrillo like the first

773
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,480
semester at cabrillo

774
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,640
i was like all right well i don't have a

775
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,960
job so i was like working as a

776
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,240
as a as a market uh

777
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,240
what do you call that a

778
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,399
market seller i was selling french like

779
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,520
bread

780
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,760
and i was just like okay you know maybe

781
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,960
this is not what i want to do the rest

782
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,000
of my life

783
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,240
like that cabrillo's job site saw some

784
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,039
like it

785
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,080
like internships down the street um

786
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,760
got into looker as a it intern i was

787
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,840
like this is cool like i want to pursue

788
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,640
this

789
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,559
so i actually ended up changing my major

790
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,159
from computer engineering

791
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,120
to cyber security and then i met up with

792
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,960
irvin he was telling me he's like yeah

793
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,480
man this is the route to go and i was

794
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,279
like

795
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,240
here i am um and that's mainly it i

796
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,320
was unfortunately i unfortunately had to

797
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,279
leave

798
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,760
urban side because i was offered an

799
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,679
opportunity as a software engineering

800
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,320
intern

801
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,919
at balbix which is a company in san jose

802
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,960
um but if not like if i could like

803
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,760
pursue

804
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,159
this and just stay here i would says

805
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,840
unfortunately taking the next step in

806
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,120
his career

807
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,840
i mean but honestly like i have i feel

808
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,480
like

809
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,120
the project-based learning with you was

810
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,080
like

811
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,559
major in anything better than anything i

812
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,440
could do

813
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,200
yeah i want to butt in just to a second

814
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,720
that one um

815
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,279
i think everyone working under irvin has

816
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,799
that same mentality

817
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,880
i i personally got a job offer like

818
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,080
halfway through

819
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,480
my time here that you know ten dollars

820
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,679
an hour or more

821
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,000
but i would be at some i.t company

822
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,080
turning things off and on again

823
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,039
um which was nightmarish to think about

824
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,080
all things considered because i'm

825
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,720
sitting here

826
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,080
learning stuff and having fun the whole

827
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,960
way along you know

828
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,320
and oh and last but not least the guy

829
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,840
who's been with me for

830
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,159
way longer than we want to admit vinay

831
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,200
so i was in high school in socal

832
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,320
kind of met up with irvin and

833
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,440
was part of his program in the infancy

834
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,200
and then eventually came to uc santa

835
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,440
cruz for computer science but decided

836
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,120
that programming wasn't quite

837
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,840
what i wanted to pursue so i joined

838
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,480
cabrillo and the team to do more cyber

839
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,440
security stuff

840
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,320
last fall and i've been working with the

841
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:26,799
team

842
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,880
doing what everyone else has already

843
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,919
mentioned

844
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,080
and i actually have an offer with

845
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,039
crowdstrike

846
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,799
as an application security engineer that

847
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,640
i'll be pursuing in the future

848
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,799
so this is about my last time with the

849
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,360
team as well

850
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:48,320
so we have grown from just a simple

851
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,600
summer camp to a academic

852
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,960
year-long program to uh

853
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,679
becoming national uh this same group

854
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,840
creates the cyber security contest for

855
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,960
all of california

856
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,080
and florida through skillsusa

857
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,200
along with making contests for the

858
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,679
the san francisco bay area and

859
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,559
everything else that we do along the way

860
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,360
uh this is a very busy group they they

861
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,840
have

862
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,519
they do a whole lot of projects

863
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,399
and as you've seen they they definitely

864
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,080
get put through the ringer

865
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,559
and come out quite victorious so i have

866
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,200
a few questions to get the ball started

867
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,840
and we'll let let them answer if you

868
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,519
have any questions put them in the chat

869
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,320
and let's let's see uh my first question

870
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,600
for the group

871
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,480
uh is what has been the most fun or the

872
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,000
best experience you've had

873
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,640
uh can we start with the um the bug

874
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,279
bounty

875
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,840
story yeah go ahead i feel like that was

876
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,679
definitely the most fun that i had with

877
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,279
this team

878
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,840
do we need to screen share the instagram

879
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,159
post

880
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,039
so i'll uh give you a brief uh we

881
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:03,919
administered

882
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,080
plenty of in-person competitions before

883
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,679
the lockdown times

884
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,519
um and one of them was called the bug

885
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,000
bounty we crafted fake bank servers

886
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,840
on i believe they were raspberry pi

887
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,039
small computers

888
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,600
uh with various atm hardware components

889
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,279
so the students were tasked to seek out

890
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,960
the bugs that we had planted

891
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,919
um but it was very chaotic because we uh

892
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,120
we were scrambling with the it

893
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,799
department to try and figure out how the

894
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,159
internet was going to get hooked up in

895
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:28,640
our

896
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,440
our testing area which was the cafeteria

897
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,240
and then

898
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,240
i don't know not pointing fingers here

899
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,000
that someone left on

900
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
the infrastructure overnight and we

901
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,679
actually got breached

902
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,720
by someone looking to find a a real life

903
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,000
bank server um but

904
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,360
you know by the time that we were ready

905
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,720
to deploy it we got everything pulled

906
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
together uh and it was great we had a

907
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,159
lot of fun with the students on that one

908
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,159
we had a live panel of judges

909
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,480
that were there to uh critique the

910
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,799
students and give them feedback

911
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,159
but it was a lot less as to um

912
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,960
what happened that day yeah walking in

913
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,320
on the morning the competition because

914
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,720
our

915
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,159
those days are always flooded you're

916
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,559
just always on someone's gonna need help

917
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,919
something isn't working

918
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,600
we need all of our tas on deck at all

919
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,159
time so having that had happened

920
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,279
uh to start off the morning was a quite

921
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,399
the adventure not only did the

922
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,399
competitors have to find bugs

923
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,559
our own team had to find their own bugs

924
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,760
and patch them

925
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,080
so that the competitors would have a a

926
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,000
fair playing game that was

927
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,360
that was quite the morning but uh credit

928
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,279
where it's due vinay found and fixed the

929
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,559
bug that day

930
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,678
and we're up and rolling again

931
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,600
speaking of like the most fun

932
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,880
experiences uh in that competition

933
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,440
we also spoofed credit which i thought

934
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,159
was pretty cool

935
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,600
um a lot of um stuff

936
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,640
it was uh learning and we

937
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,080
we got to show um those students how

938
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,000
how easy and scary some of these old

939
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
credit cards are

940
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,239
and uh it was that was probably one of

941
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,399
the funnest experiences

942
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,000
i it was great i got to learn how to

943
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,918
solder rushing to solder together like

944
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,599
two or three more because they had uh

945
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,719
they'd broken down

946
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,560
throughout the day uh and i was

947
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,480
that was one heck of an adventure um

948
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,000
we seem to always have them like that

949
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,480
though you know well we can't anticipate

950
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,520
everything that will happen

951
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,560
you know oh yeah yeah no it's i'm sure

952
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,359
as everyone here

953
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,800
knows there's there's at least that one

954
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,560
thing that has to go wrong and being

955
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,239
good at your job is being able to adapt

956
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:40,879
to it

957
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,879
more so than uh preventing bad things

958
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,480
from happening or things from

959
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,040
growing wrong on occasion well and it's

960
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,960
also about maintaining like that growth

961
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,520
mindset

962
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,119
because i believe that one of the

963
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,960
reasons that they got hacked were uh

964
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,599
like poor password management uh which

965
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,320
was a

966
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,920
intentional we wanted the students to

967
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,359
find that but then that

968
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,079
bit us in the butt because you know it

969
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,280
was

970
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,599
it was obviously very easy to explain so

971
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,200
it showed us like oh we can't

972
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
we can't just you know play this dumb we

973
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,720
have to think very carefully about what

974
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,160
we're giving the students and how we're

975
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,520
executing it

976
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,599
so that was definitely my favorite day

977
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,280
yeah uh what else what other

978
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,160
fun best experiences you've had oh i can

979
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,839
i can ramble about scoring engine for a

980
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,680
bit that'll be fun

981
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
so um when i started out we were only

982
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,359
doing cyberpatriot

983
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,040
um and i don't want to get too

984
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,960
opinionated here but

985
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,440
uh i i'm i'm big about gamification

986
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,880
about making this fun

987
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,800
i've always enjoyed this field it's

988
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,160
always been something where like

989
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
i'll spend my my first experience was

990
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,320
metasploitable was on my own time

991
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,640
and that was a fun relaxing friday night

992
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,680
for me

993
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,839
um kind of thing and um

994
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,440
so scoring engine was not sorry not

995
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,359
scoring engine uh cyberpatriot was not

996
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,200
that at least at the level we were

997
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,240
uh working in um but we did hear a bit

998
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,640
about higher up and they had a cool

999
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,400
scoring system that gave

1000
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,160
people points based off of what systems

1001
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,440
they had up

1002
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,119
a lot of my time working with irvin was

1003
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,599
spent on making our own version of that

1004
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,079
um not necessarily to compete with

1005
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,440
cyberpatriot but

1006
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,960
yeah to compete with cyberpatriot um

1007
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,200
and this started from me because i'm i'm

1008
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,240
uh

1009
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,839
earlier on i was definitely a junior

1010
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,240
programmer um i was still used to

1011
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,040
not using external libraries um so

1012
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,960
version one of scoring engine

1013
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,400
was uh outputting text to a

1014
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,200
to a uh apache server so just updating

1015
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,040
the the web page on the fly instead of

1016
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,640
having any cgi

1017
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,359
or background scripts running relying on

1018
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,000
like

1019
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,920
low-level socket connections for all the

1020
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,200
communications

1021
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,560
and took me a lot of time to make

1022
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,160
something with not too much to show for

1023
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,640
it

1024
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,280
granted thanks to vinay uh for being

1025
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,040
willing to help me learn how to program

1026
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,160
a bit better

1027
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,000
um scoring engine v3 uh a while later

1028
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
has been quite wonderful we have a fancy

1029
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,839
flask-based web ui

1030
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,640
um and it was really evolved through all

1031
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,200
of that

1032
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,520
but i've had so many great memories

1033
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,240
working on that project

1034
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,599
we don't talk about scoring engine v2 oh

1035
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,359
hey scoring engine b2 wasn't bad it was

1036
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,839
better than v1 v1 was entirely hardcoded

1037
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,760
scoring engine v2 was less hard-coded

1038
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,200
but we were able to use scoring engine

1039
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,040
v3 for a couple of competitions this

1040
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,440
year

1041
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,079
and it went pretty smoothly the

1042
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,920
competitions were successful

1043
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,680
after our changes and no longer using uh

1044
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,839
connections and direct connections tcp

1045
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,280
connections for everything

1046
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,680
so it's a lot easier for easier for us

1047
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,320
to manage

1048
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,640
as well as for there's less things that

1049
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,160
can go wrong so it's been

1050
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,599
a smooth experience overall yeah um

1051
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,280
in addition to some load balancing

1052
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
changes we had made um

1053
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,680
but yeah it's nice just you don't really

1054
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,599
it's hard to push yourself to sit there

1055
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,760
and start working on databases or moving

1056
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,240
to a

1057
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,800
to a web api when you're on your own and

1058
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,400
it's something new but having the other

1059
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,160
having binay in this case who was a bit

1060
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,520
more experienced with this stuff to jump

1061
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,960
into it forced me to

1062
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,119
jump in and i at least hope i was a lot

1063
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,400
more helpful than i was initially

1064
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
expecting myself to be

1065
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,200
um but uh we did have some fun with get

1066
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,680
blame

1067
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,079
that day or during that set those chefs

1068
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,839
uh sessions

1069
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,160
um oh but yeah it's that project

1070
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,400
v1 had a fun story behind it that was a

1071
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,760
discord message sent

1072
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,920
oh no it was a two-parter there was the

1073
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,880
8am

1074
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,079
i don't know if i'm going to be able to

1075
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,520
finish this in time by by the

1076
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,640
competition

1077
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,839
here's my plan to fix it um followed by

1078
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,680
another message at 4am

1079
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,680
the morning before a competition of i

1080
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,800
got it working

1081
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,920
i'm going to bed now

1082
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,760
um so yeah that's been it's wild

1083
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,119
adventure but i've also

1084
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,480
you know i think something that was fun

1085
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,920
about this job is although i had my big

1086
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
magnum opus of programming and designing

1087
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,040
the system

1088
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,440
i was also working on a lot more of my

1089
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,960
soft skills

1090
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,440
um you know i think ervin's gonna end up

1091
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,640
describing this better than i did

1092
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,359
because i was just

1093
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,119
i i was so in the zone i don't remember

1094
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,880
too much was have that uh what was going

1095
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,599
on but

1096
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,920
one of our competitions um i had to make

1097
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,119
sure everyone was in the right room at

1098
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,079
the right time

1099
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,359
or certain groups of people were in the

1100
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,119
right room at the right time which led

1101
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,720
to me sprinting around

1102
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,359
a san jose campus uh on a saturday

1103
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,359
morning for quite a while

1104
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,480
uh in in a full suit

1105
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,240
um but you know for me i

1106
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,640
actually have issues with social anxiety

1107
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,000
um

1108
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,440
you may not be able to see it but my leg

1109
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,200
is shaking like wild right now because i

1110
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,440
have to talk to like a whole 12 people

1111
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,680
um but it's really been a chance to work

1112
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,160
on that

1113
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,599
and just get used to it in a

1114
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,880
professional sense because it's a skill

1115
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,240
you need you know

1116
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,400
um nothing wrong with being nervous

1117
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,760
about talking to people but you have to

1118
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,280
be able to overcome your nervousness

1119
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,560
and i given my own choices i would have

1120
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,359
been at home

1121
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,440
clicking away on my computer alone the

1122
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,960
past three years instead of actually

1123
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,480
going out and doing stuff like this

1124
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,599
um if i can expand on that a little bit

1125
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,440
uh just with the social aspect

1126
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,640
the team has been a very good

1127
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,119
opportunity for me to uh meet people

1128
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,599
of a like mind because there are so many

1129
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,240
of us

1130
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,680
out there who are very interested in

1131
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,440
cyber security but actually making those

1132
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,280
connections is a different story

1133
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,960
um and i still have people on my

1134
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,920
reference list on my on my uh

1135
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,480
my cv that were on this team two years

1136
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,200
ago

1137
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,079
you know um and we keep up contacts i

1138
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,599
like to see how they're doing

1139
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,640
uh and it's it's been such a

1140
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,280
growth opportunity in that sense for me

1141
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,160
and i think a few other people as well

1142
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,240
and it was it was funny you uh you'd

1143
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,319
been gone for six months i think

1144
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,560
by about now i quit like six months ago

1145
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,000
and i'm still here

1146
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,480
you you rejoined the the voice call i'm

1147
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,079
like oh yeah brandon's here right right

1148
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:58,880
on time

1149
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,319
didn't even didn't even notice you were

1150
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,880
gone honestly oh thanks

1151
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,400
is that a good thing you're a feel bad

1152
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,800
in a good way you're always part of the

1153
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,400
team um

1154
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,319
it just it feels more comfortable having

1155
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,560
you here in the group call

1156
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,640
um and it's it's always been like that

1157
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,160
like we now

1158
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,200
even now we still have people from uh

1159
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,520
uh like way before here who weren't

1160
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,400
working here as much

1161
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,560
who were talking in chat regularly who

1162
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,920
we stay communicated with

1163
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,040
um yeah this team really was

1164
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,760
is something special um there's a reason

1165
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,119
why i think many of us have had the

1166
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,720
experience of getting a job offer that

1167
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,200
is

1168
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,520
air quotes better that we turn down

1169
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,040
because we wouldn't be

1170
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,560
growing as people as much and we

1171
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,000
wouldn't have this wonderful work

1172
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,160
environment

1173
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,880
gosh jeremy thank you so much for saying

1174
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,280
that you are such a breath of fresh air

1175
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,880
inspirational truly thank you

1176
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,920
so i i got a question how helpful is

1177
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,040
this to getting a job

1178
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,280
because uh you know most of the

1179
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
companies that i talk to

1180
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,400
and even whenever i'm looking for

1181
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,560
candidates uh typically look for someone

1182
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,720
with projects and demonstratable

1183
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,599
you know demonstrable skills like this

1184
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,960
um

1185
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,240
and it's kind of more important than

1186
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,079
your pedigree or your degrees or

1187
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,200
anything like that but it's like

1188
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,280
something concrete you've done and

1189
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,480
have accomplished and can then

1190
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,720
articulate

1191
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,800
i can answer this um there's been so

1192
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,040
many projects that we've worked on

1193
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,119
as a team we've worked on everything

1194
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,280
from programming to running competitions

1195
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,440
teaching and tutoring students uh

1196
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,800
someone would have found something that

1197
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,079
they liked and have definitely worked on

1198
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,119
their skills

1199
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,960
like for jeremy and myself we've worked

1200
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,240
on a lot of the infrastructure and

1201
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,000
programming the last few months

1202
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,160
but also related to cyber security which

1203
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,920
is not a combination that a lot of

1204
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,040
people are able to get

1205
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,400
through education so it's been able to

1206
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,040
help focus our skills in a direction

1207
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,520
that

1208
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,920
is highly in demand but very little

1209
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,200
supplies has been

1210
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,599
it's helped me get a job and i'm sure

1211
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,400
that can be

1212
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,520
the same can be said for the other

1213
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,000
people in this game like brandon and

1214
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
juan have recently gotten offers

1215
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,280
yeah and it's i mean even then just kind

1216
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,040
of being able to have what we have to

1217
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,480
show from our work

1218
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,599
has been wonderful um you know for for

1219
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,960
me and vinay working on scoring engine

1220
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,800
v3 that was my first time working on a

1221
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,400
large project

1222
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,079
um as a group and it was just nice it's

1223
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
it's you have the people where you can

1224
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,960
really mesh with well

1225
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,040
and um being able to work up that group

1226
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,160
ethic for like

1227
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,640
large meaningful projects not just uh

1228
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,319
doing a science report that's a week

1229
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,839
long of talking to three other people

1230
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,119
um really is one of those skills that

1231
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,000
you're not going to be

1232
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,640
able to learn at college um at the level

1233
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,280
it's

1234
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,920
needed or used in the professional realm

1235
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,359
um where you might be working with the

1236
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,040
same group of people on something for

1237
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,200
four or five years

1238
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,480
um and that can be really important to

1239
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,920
actually making it beneficial because

1240
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,280
i'm sure many of you have heard that

1241
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,319
what one program

1242
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,480
programmer can do in a week uh 20

1243
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,760
programmers can do in a month and a half

1244
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,960
um it's a lot of that just comes from

1245
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,960
you start adding on more stuff things

1246
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,720
spread out too much a lot of work gets

1247
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,160
done that might not be as

1248
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,800
viable because everyone has a different

1249
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,319
idea in their mind of what the project

1250
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,079
is and what it should be

1251
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,839
um yeah

1252
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,160
yeah we uh we had a lot of very dynamic

1253
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,200
things that we did on the team um never

1254
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,640
did we do the same thing twice which

1255
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,920
meant that we had a lot of learning to

1256
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,400
do

1257
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,839
especially considering that we have to

1258
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,400
then teach that to a group of students

1259
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,119
so you know from everything everything

1260
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,160
between

1261
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,800
open source software and you know

1262
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,720
proprietary cloud services

1263
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,880
um you know we had to really know the

1264
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,400
ins and outs of that

1265
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,160
so i i can speak to

1266
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,359
i don't actually know how much i can

1267
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,280
disclose but of the interview i had with

1268
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,560
this job i just got

1269
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,160
uh they were looking over my cv and

1270
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,319
they're like oh you can really do this

1271
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,920
like you know how to

1272
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,920
administer like a microsoft active

1273
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,280
directory and i'm like

1274
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,560
i mean yeah i did it i can show you

1275
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,200
you know it's great not only to

1276
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,319
feel like you're part of something

1277
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:18,800
bigger

1278
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,920
of course but also to have that

1279
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,560
expansive opportunity and that it just

1280
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,960
kept growing and kept changing

1281
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,480
yeah it's actually it's funny going

1282
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,319
forward i feel like during my job

1283
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,440
interview i'm going to be a little bit

1284
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,000
snarky

1285
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,599
because i'm like are you really going to

1286

1293
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,640

1294
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,319
if i need to cool off for a second and

1295
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,079
have everyone know that's on

1296
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,359
uh helping the work ethic

1297
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,960
um but yeah i've i've worked a

1298
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,000
you know what is intended or

1299
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,319
ultimately a ta job at a college but

1300
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:03,280
it's given me

1301
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,359
all this it's almost surreal how

1302
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,960
different the life that this team is

1303
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,760
living

1304
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,680
compared to the other tas and some of

1305
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,920
the other departments at cabrillo

1306
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,160
um in terms of what we're creating and

1307
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,520
you know it's how much work we have to

1308
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,000
put in

1309
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,920
ultimately i would encourage you guys

1310
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,280
definitely to leverage that i mean

1311
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,480
whenever i

1312
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,680
got my degree i was it was 94 to 98 and

1313
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,000
i worked in campus i t doing networking

1314
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,119
system stuff

1315
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,720
those four years of getting paid six

1316
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,560
dollars an hour

1317
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,000
instantly gave me a leg up in the

1318
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,319
workplace and

1319
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,839
you know all my friends had cool stuff

1320
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,079
to do in the summer i didn't

1321
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,400
but uh i never felt like i had to look

1322
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
for a job after that after getting that

1323
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,800
solid footing of experience so yeah

1324
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,319
that's awesome you guys are doing this i

1325
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,640
think

1326
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,640
uh you guys are smart for looking

1327
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,560
looking now and taking you know taking

1328
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,079
something that seems to pay less but

1329
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,920
much more much more in the long run

1330
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,680
not everyone has that uh that vision

1331
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,319
and don't chase the dollar chase the

1332
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,000
skill and the dollars will come man

1333
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,800
i wanted to add on a little bit to that

1334
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,960
um even

1335
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,680
just like even working here i feel like

1336
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,640
we were

1337
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,440
all of us got a lot of good direction on

1338
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,880
like a career like

1339
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,079
we're always pointed in the right

1340
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,079
direction somebody would know a little

1341
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,680
bit about a certification that we would

1342
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,119
need to get or

1343
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,200
um irvine would know about the next

1344
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,400
thing you should go after

1345
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,559
he would have like maybe better beta

1346
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,880
testings uh for certs that maybe we need

1347
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,280
to go

1348
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,680
do and he would like recommend for us to

1349
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,800
go get

1350
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,119
um a few of us have just recently done

1351
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,400
uh a few certs i know through

1352
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,040
i had no idea what security plus comptia

1353
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,000
was so

1354
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,559
i got that and i also was able to get

1355
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,079
pen test plus

1356
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,280
so those are really cool and it's

1357
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,400
something that you can't get you

1358
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,319
most likely wouldn't get just by going

1359
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,640
to school oh yeah and there's also you

1360
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,119
know it

1361
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,800
um although yeah we have the the heavy

1362
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,160
guidance if needed

1363
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,800
um scoring engine was more or less me

1364
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,400
wanting to go and make a thing

1365
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,839
um guac bot as well was uh

1366
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,520
i i definitely don't want to say that

1367
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,200
was me but uh

1368
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,800
i was the one who got fed up the

1369
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,240
quickest having had to work with

1370
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,520
guacamole one

1371
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,000
one night and immediately started coding

1372
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,599
a bot to do it for us

1373
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,359
even if it was the simple requests and

1374
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,280
uh vinnie and ryan were the ones that

1375
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,480
really took that forward

1376
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,400
i think it was surprising too because

1377
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,599
that's full-on

1378
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,839
that's a system we had made uh

1379
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,400
casually on the side i didn't think we

1380
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,160
had a contest

1381
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,640
right some context into what that was

1382
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,000
what that is yeah fair that all right

1383
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,200
i'm gonna leave that to vinay and ryan

1384
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,960
then because i only coded one part of it

1385
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,359
uh

1386
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,960
one evening like a year ago

1387
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,359
okay um i can start

1388
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,440
sorry if my if my audio is out but you

1389
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,359
know it's a little iffy right now

1390
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:07,839
um about about eight months ago

1391
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,119
uh we were fed up working with

1392
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,720
uh guacamole and doing stuff by hand

1393
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,240
so we created a bot um on discord

1394
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,760
um which is very much uh um

1395
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,440
very very similar to slack if you've

1396
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,520
never used it

1397
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,240
and you request and it also utilizes a

1398
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,680
google cloud platform i just create

1399
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,440
uh instances for someone their time

1400
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,119
whoever wants one can have one for

1401
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,440
about an hour uh really the thought was

1402
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,480
to

1403
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,599
um kind of do something similar to a lot

1404
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,720
of these

1405
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,720
um i still doing like try hack me

1406
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,720
the box a lot of these sort of have ways

1407
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,839
to borrow a computer

1408
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:57,840
and

1409
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,240
[Music]

1410
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,760
it worked out really well we're actually

1411
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,839
using it for our camp right now

1412
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,640
and things are looking pretty good on it

1413
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,920
um

1414
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,160
it's just an automated way to rebut the

1415
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,879
virtual machine

1416
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,880
that we have uh have chromebooks

1417
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,119
that's what the school issues them and

1418
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,000
if you've ever messed with the

1419
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,040
chromebook you know they're pretty

1420
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,480
locked down you can't run virtual

1421
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,559
machines you can't really do much

1422
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,040
but we found um i i'm pretty sure it was

1423
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,480
jeremy who first found

1424
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,599
apache guacamole as an html5 way of

1425
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,480
getting

1426
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,040
uh you know to the desktop so we said

1427
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,000
that was ryan

1428
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,960
just to interject i was the one who got

1429
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,559
bored or got upset about it the

1430
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,640
first ryan was the one who found it yeah

1431
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,920
we found it

1432
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,880
we said okay we could use this and then

1433
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,599
yeah we

1434
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,760
we started providing students access to

1435
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,359
it and then yeah

1436
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,960
jeremy said you know what this this is

1437
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,280
horrible to manually issue out

1438
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,359
credentials and manage it and

1439
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,240
yeah just go uh i think i was spending a

1440
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,839
saturday night making

1441
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,319
30 or 40 different student accounts in

1442
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,400
guacamole which was

1443
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,720
you know poor ryan i i believe he was

1444
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,920
the one carrying all the weight for that

1445
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,800
before

1446
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,960
had just gotten used to making like yeah

1447
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,200
no i got to make 120 accounts now

1448
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,000
that's my evening yeah we serve about

1449
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,960
700 or so

1450
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,079
students so you know making the counts

1451
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,280
by hand sucks and then they came up with

1452
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,720
the idea of using

1453
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,599
a bot to do it and now a student in our

1454
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:34,160
program

1455
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,359
just requests by by a bot command and

1456
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,480
they'll get a

1457
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,079
a machine that they need and now they

1458
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,079
can do the work from any machine that

1459
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:42,800
they're on

1460
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,880
so that that's that's part of us

1461
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,040
providing those resources

1462
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,800
to students so that that is not a

1463
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,200
barrier for them to get into cyber

1464
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,759
security

1465
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,920
i like to mention that uh this is by far

1466
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,040
my my favorite part of the job um

1467
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,559
and it may be the most two is to

1468
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,240
uh create a project and to see it to the

1469
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,119
end

1470
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,240
um you know through

1471
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,240
all the beginnings all the middle you

1472
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,520
got a lot of testing

1473
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,280
a lot of testing and um it was just

1474
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,400
a lot to do and there's a lot of we do a

1475
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,599
lot with our

1476
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,640
competitions and stuff we we create a

1477
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,680
lot of stuff

1478
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,880
just from really narrow times

1479
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,800
a lot of ideas so it gets very creative

1480
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,880
and uh definitely my favorite

1481
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,720
um that actually gives me something i

1482
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,160
wouldn't mind going on about for for a

1483
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,520
short while sadly they're not all

1484
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,640
successes

1485
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,520
um but that's that's life not not every

1486
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,440
idea you have is gonna be perfect

1487
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,359
um something's gonna go wrong somewhere

1488
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:52,800
but uh or

1489
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,240
something a bit more out there i

1490
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,480
remember last summer camp

1491
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,960
i i had a minecraft server going as part

1492
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,559
of the thing and it wasn't like

1493
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,559
just kid playing kids playing minecraft

1494
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,240
it was it was the computer mods

1495
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,240
i was having a lot of fun um i grew up

1496
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,359
really liking these mods because you're

1497
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:08,800
so they're coding lua

1498
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,119
for a uh a block in minecraft to go

1499
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,520
around and mind other blocks for you

1500
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,160
um but there was some crazy stuff with

1501
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,920
that and although

1502
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,000
um during the time i wasn't able to give

1503
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
that project itself the commitment that

1504
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,440
i think it needed to really be

1505
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,960
successful um it was it was so much fun

1506
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,240
to be able to try stuff like that and we

1507
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,480
do have projects like this fairly often

1508
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,400
um and they're honestly more successful

1509
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,760
than not which is

1510
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,079
uh which is a fun part about the job is

1511
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,040
sitting there and actually yeah being

1512
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,400
able to see the project go off and have

1513
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,680
something happen

1514
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,520
um but but being able to do stuff like

1515
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,760
that uh was incredible because like i

1516
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,040
had fun you know

1517
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,400
it did kind of suck that i couldn't

1518
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,880
really uh see see that product to its

1519
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,079
fullest potential

1520
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,000
but at the same time like just being

1521
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,280
able to try it

1522
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,960
being able to go to my boss and be like

1523
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,359
hey you know what the summer camp needs

1524
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,839
minecraft um would have would have been

1525
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,040
wonderful

1526
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,240
um or it is wonderful you know uh

1527
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,599
it's it's really a great part about the

1528
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,200
job is being able to try stuff like that

1529
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:07,680
that's

1530
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,760
a little bit out there um yeah

1531
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,079
yeah if i may add some context to that

1532
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,599
um

1533
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,200
the the reason that we wanted to put up

1534
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,800
the minecraft server was because

1535
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,400
it was our first summer camp that was

1536
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,079
all remote due to coven

1537
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,280
and we were trying to find an answer to

1538
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,960
the hardware component of the summer

1539
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,319
camp where students understood

1540
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,680
the components of the computer and how

1541
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,079
to put them together and what that means

1542
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,960
so it it didn't turn out to be the best

1543
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,280
solution but like jeremy said it was

1544
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,559
it was a great idea and like ryan said

1545
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,400
you have to deliver at the end of the

1546
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,839
day so yeah

1547
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,440
he jeremy really put his heart and soul

1548
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,280
into making that happen and having it

1549
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,960
spread for the students but

1550
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,480
you know wait i think we were all very

1551
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,000
booked that summer trying to

1552
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,079
we were all very booked and also it

1553
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,680
wasn't it was the kind of thing we'd

1554
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,200
need students to sign up for

1555
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,640
separately because they already have to

1556
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,359
invest the 15 or 25 dollars

1557
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,440
to buy this physical game to play play

1558
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,200
uh play with us but

1559
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,559
it was a fun little experiment and some

1560
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,079
of the kids did like it it just wasn't

1561
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,680
enough to build a proper community and

1562
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,720
move forward

1563
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,359
um but yeah and also thank you brandon

1564
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,720
you remember more about my own project

1565
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,400
than i do

1566
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,839
it was supposed to be our project and

1567
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,839
then i got completely sidetracked making

1568
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:20,480
content

1569
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,760
so yeah we both got oh yes

1570
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,400
let's see i have the the reverse

1571
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,920
question for you guys

1572
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,520
the most challenging part

1573
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,319
of the uh being on this team oh i can

1574
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,280
i'll get mine

1575
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,280
out of the way really quickly here uh

1576
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,839
remember that 4am message i sent

1577
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,359
i would say about the eight hours

1578
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:48,160
leading up to then

1579
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,240
um i have a question did you guys find

1580
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,200
it easy

1581
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,640
uh to pass the comptia security plus

1582
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,040
exam

1583
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,839
oh yes

1584
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,359
did you have exposure prior to as well

1585
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,280
too or you just kind of went from

1586
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,040
being a student and then going right

1587
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,720
into it and just taking it i'd love to

1588
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,079
hear how you

1589
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,920
transitioned into it how long it took

1590
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,599
you the difficulty level you thought it

1591
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:20,799
was

1592
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,480
and anything that you can share that

1593
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,559
helps the next person thank you

1594
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:27,040
definitely um i i'd love to speak to

1595
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,040
this because without irvin's guidance i

1596
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,000
probably wouldn't have

1597
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,640
taken any of the certifications that i

1598
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,720
had or at least in the time

1599
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,839
that i did uh i got

1600
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,920
hooked on this whole cyber security

1601
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,400
thing with uh with the accc

1602
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,079
through their summer camps and that led

1603
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,760
me to concurrently enroll

1604
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,079
when i was in high school in the cyber

1605
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,520
security classes that were provided at

1606
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,319
cabrillo

1607
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,319
and the whole point of the classes was

1608
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,000
to gear you up and make sure you

1609
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,680
understand everything you need to pass

1610
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,680
those exams

1611
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,599
so i took the ethical hacking class that

1612
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:02,960
irvin hosted

1613
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,839
my junior year of high school and from

1614
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,839
that class i learned everything i needed

1615
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,920
to gear up and get ready for the

1616
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,520
security plus that along with the

1617
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,160
prerequisite

1618
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,760
class um and you know all i had to

1619
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,160
study was my notes i had to ask a couple

1620
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,960
questions and i did pretty okay on it

1621
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,520
um and the opportunity arose because i

1622
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,040
think irvin

1623
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,599
either had a comp or a heavy discount

1624
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,400
for the exam

1625
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,000
yeah yeah and that was like such a

1626
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,079
breath of fresh air because you know

1627
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,359
that's that's an industry level

1628
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,680
certification that we were able to get

1629
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,760
myself at a very young age and um

1630
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,760
very easily facilitated through the

1631
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,960
college

1632
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,880
yeah and it's one of those things to uh

1633
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,319
part of why we use discord and some of

1634
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:51,680
the nice things about that is these

1635
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,119
group notifications

1636
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,559
um i recently like two weeks ago uh took

1637
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:57,920
my pen test plus

1638
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,359
and although i'm not too uh it was the

1639
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,280
beta so i wasn't too confident or i

1640
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,880
don't really know how well i did

1641
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,359
um especially because the covet 19

1642
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:06,720
vaccine was uh

1643
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,880
i just gone dose two the day before um

1644
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,640
and it was also an exam that was at

1645
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,079
midnight because i don't know how to

1646
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,359
tell time

1647
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:15,610
uh

1648
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:16,050
[Laughter]

1649
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:18,559
[Music]

1650
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:19,839
thank you for the reactions denise

1651
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,079
they're wonderful

1652
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,359
um but yeah like

1653
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:28,079
even then i was in this horrible state

1654
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,359
you know

1655
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,680
on question 50 out of 100 out of 10 i

1656
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,200
realized i really needed to go to the

1657
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,599
bathroom so i was rushing too

1658
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,760
but it went really well i did not feel

1659
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,720
unprepared

1660
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,480
you know i'm not confident that entirely

1661
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,319
that i passed it because of

1662
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,119
after mentioned reasons but it was not

1663
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,480
lack of preparation

1664
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,520
um and that was my first comptia test

1665
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,160
ever

1666
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,559
uh that i'd ever actually taken and just

1667
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,319
i also only found out about it because

cyber security chapter down here in

1675
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,440

a student chapter so i'm very interested

1677
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,559
in hearing

1678
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,799
how women or young women are engaged

1679
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,079
or engaging in your program we

1680
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,200
have we have a legendary

1681
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,400
middle school girls team

1682
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,520
they came out of nowhere in 2018

1683
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,319
and took second place in a contest that

1684
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:39,760
was predominantly

1685
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,960
college and high school

1686
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,720
they i i think if you had asked

1687
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,640
around the room and the judges they

1688
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,160
would have never guessed

1689
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,079
that they would have done so well in

1690
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,000
both their technical knowledge and their

1691
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,200
soft skills

1692
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,599
they have been with us ever since and

1693
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,319
have been our leading examples from them

1694
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,240
we have had a number of high schools

1695
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,240
bring up all girls teams

1696
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,200
and participate and win in our various

1697
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,960
contests so things like the bug bounty

1698
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,160
that we did

1699
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,480
the small business consultation that's

1700
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,480
the first time we all met them

1701
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,599
uh we did our cyber olympics

1702
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,200
this past winter uh they we have seen a

1703
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,480
growth of girls and

1704
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,079
those those middle school girls have

1705
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,760
always been my favorite

1706
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,160
because they they were the unexpected

1707
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:28,880
yeah i

1708
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,760
i that day too just because it was also

1709
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,960
it was an all middle school team you

1710
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,079
know no one except

1711
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,440
expects to see the whole middle school

1712
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,520
team up on on the front stage

1713
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,839
uh they're up on the stage getting first

1714
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:40,640
place

1715
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,559
um so we're all really excited to hear

1716
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,559
that from them and they also they won by

1717
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,240
like a landslide

1718
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,880
we're talking like they got 700 points

1719
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,440
and and

1720
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,960
second place got 500. i i

1721
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,720
that was that was a fun day that was one

1722
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,079
of our more interesting con

1723
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,119
competitions as well and i think uh we

1724
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:00,240
we do try to be

1725
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,240
uh experimental also in our competition

1726
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,720
designs that enable stuff like that

1727
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,960
um for example that one i know a strong

1728
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,480
part of it was

1729
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,799
it mattered more your presentation um to

1730
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,160
the judges you know

1731
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,440
being able to sit there and have those

1732
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,200
soft skills because when it comes down

1733
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:15,920
to it

1734
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,520
you can have all the technical knowledge

1735
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,960
in the world but if you're if you're

1736
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,640
unsociable not really good at handling

1737
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,079
those soft skills and interacting with

1738
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:22,799
people

1739
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,799
that doesn't mean a thing and they came

1740
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:26,720
in and applied advanced soft skills and

1741
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,480
it really worked on top of having their

1742
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,520
technical down

1743
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,880
to a t um but yeah that was that was a

1744
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,760
really cool

1745
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,119
really cool saturday um yes we have we

1746
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,040
have a girl presence and they are rock

1747
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,720
stars

1748
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,720
um i also think the summer camp's been

1749
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,240
doing something with that as well

1750
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,880
although um i think for those if my

1751
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:47,839
understanding is correct for those

1752
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,079
programs we like to have um

1753
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,720
uh all girl teachers as well um just to

1754
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,400
make it more comforting so i personally

1755
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,760
wouldn't know too much

1756
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,480
uh in terms of introductory cyber camp

1757
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,319
that that wrapped up this last week

1758
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:03,119
but then um honestly with everything all

1759
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,280
of our marketing amy we could always do

1760
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,039
always do better you know with with

1761
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:08,720
making sure the messages is getting out

1762
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,079
there and always have more girls in the

1763
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:10,720
program

1764
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,079
ladies females women

1765
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:15,359
yeah i was just gonna ask like what do

1766
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,440
you think if there's anything that you

1767
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,640
do differently

1768
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,680
um to appeal to women in

1769
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,319
your programs or if you can think of

1770
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,880
anything that's kind of like a great tip

1771
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,480
that's part of what we're why we're

1772
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,559
gathered as a group irwin is a board

1773
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,119
member with pacific hackers as well too

1774
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,160
and we're trying to do just that

1775
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,680
bring women up into the fold to

1776
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,039
work alongside men as well and bring up

1777
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,400
students vets

1778
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,359
etc and really just share on the

1779
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:48,000
knowledge

1780
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,359
of um you know the skill sets and the

1781
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,599
tools that they need to be working with

1782
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:56,079
so that we can really grow the

1783
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,920
cybersecurity community and

1784
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,240
put you all the work so that's the

1785
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,200
notion

1786
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,520
and so amy i know you're working with us

1787
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,559
as well

1788
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,240
um but you know denise will work with

1789
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,960
you as well and for the person who

1790
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,160
talked about working with what wheesus

1791
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,240
i'm part of that group as well so i will

1792
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,000
be working with them as well

1793
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,599
to bring them into the fold and

1794
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,760
hopefully we just have really some unity

1795
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,760
in the community about

1796
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,039
how we can you know all work together so

1797
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:31,520
thank you

1798
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,640
uh i can't speak too much to the process

1799
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,000
because i was never part of the

1800
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,640
recruitment

1801
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,960
of who we get for our camps and our

1802
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,240
competitions but

1803
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,920
um i very much noticed in the last

1804
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,880
summer camp that i

1805
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,079
i was helping create the content for um

1806
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,640
because we were remote or perhaps

1807
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,520
because it was

1808
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,799
great on one of our team members brienne

1809
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:56,559
we had outreach between santa cruz and

1810
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,240
san francisco which is you know

1811
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,559
a huge like 100 mile range between us

1812
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:01,920
and contra costa

1813
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,039
and there was a very large diverse

1814
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,960
group of people of students who were

1815
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,799
attending those programs

1816
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,160
so if there's one thing i think we do

1817
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,079
really well as outreach and

1818
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,480
it's the outreach uh that i think makes

1819
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,119
the difference

1820
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:16,960
and you know letting people know that

1821
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,240
cyber security is

1822
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,720
accessible to everybody and that we want

1823
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,640
to elevate anyone if they have the

1824
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,599
interest

1825
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,280
uh to to join us that actually brings up

1826
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:27,680
a fun

1827
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,680
tangent uh we haven't talked about our

1828
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,640
presence at the local county fair yet

1829
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,079
i mean i guess that's a bit old news

1830
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,400
nowadays but that was always a fun

1831
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,240
yearly uh event we would have um

1832
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,119
we'd be at the the santa cruz county

1833
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:43,839
fair

1834
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,119
and just have our own little booth as

1835
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,200
part of the cabrillo cabrillo section

1836
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,640
but we'd be showing off a lot of fun

1837
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,480
stuff playing with our toys

1838
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,680
um and honestly that was that was one of

1839
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,160
the more

1840
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,880
fun and almost fulfilling parts of this

1841
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,359
job

1842
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:00,400
too is as cool as a great project is i

1843
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,559
remember there there was this one kid

1844
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,200
where i was showing him just like a the

1845
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,960
uh aero dump scan

1846
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,960
on full screen on a projector and i

1847
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,319
could just see it in his

1848
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,640
eyes the stuff had just grabbed his mind

1849
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,760
he's like

1850
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,640
it was beautiful is that first time you

1851
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,160
get hello world printed out on the

1852
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,119
screen because you're put

1853
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,640
your code compiled um and you know that

1854
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,720
that happened

1855
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,200
that was two years ago almost and like i

1856
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,119
still remember that deep in my soul

1857
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:31,200
because of how great of a moment it was

1858
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,920
and uh stuff like that was is pretty

1859
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,559
common

1860
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,000
i think the county fairs are our main

1861
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,839
moment for it but um

1862
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,280
it did have a lot of moments like that

1863
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,039
like it was it'd be occasionally

1864
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:42,559
annoying you have some of the punk kids

1865
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:43,839
you know wanting to learn how to steal

1866
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,440
their friend's instagram account then

1867
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,480
you have the kids who aren't super

1868
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,160
familiar with it and like are

1869
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,039
are kind of we we try to focus on uh yes

1870
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:52,559
you can do this

1871
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,480
um you know like at the county fair i

1872
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,520
was showing people like yeah no it's

1873
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,960
just one simple command and look

1874
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,920
you're looking at everything in the

1875
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,839
nearby area not even trying to take

1876
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,760
anything just looking around in a nice

1877
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,520
organized way um so yeah getting stuff

1878
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,480
like that was

1879
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,200
was really nice um and it's always fun

1880
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,520
to see

1881
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:16,480
i have a question um how

1882
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,920
i heard the words cyber patriot right um

1883
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,119
have you guys what would you say

1884
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:26,000
has been the influence of a cyber in you

1885
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,079
guys performing in other competitions

1886
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:29,920
are there specific competitions that you

1887
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,079
would say because we did this we did

1888
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,400
better

1889
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,160
uh oh okay can i be opinionated here

1890
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,039
evan

1891
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,400
can i get a knot on that alright cool i

1892
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,720
got a knot on that um

1893
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,480
so from my experiences and granted i

1894
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,160
think i was a year year and a half

1895
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,839
behind things really getting started

1896
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:49,200
when i joined in

1897
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,799
um that was the point in which we were

1898
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,640
kind of spiteful towards cyberpatriot

1899
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,240
not not that we'd like dislike it or

1900
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:54,960
anything

1901
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,760
but it just it could have been better

1902
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,720
and you have to sit there with that

1903
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,720
feeling of we're sitting here and like

1904
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,160
presenting this challenge that can be

1905
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,760
completed by a script

1906
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,440
and that's not fun that's not how you

1907
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,200
make things um

1908
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,520
interesting to students and uh i know at

1909
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,200
least from my own

1910
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,960
uh standpoint of working with some of

1911
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,799
the stuff and i think

1912
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:18,640
this was before the um

1913
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,160
i don't remember which competition this

1914
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,559
was but one of them i'm sitting up there

1915
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:25,520
i'm like all right

1916
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,440
let's let's do legend of zelda here we

1917
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,359
have items we have exploration we have

1918
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:30,799
this how do we translate

1919
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,240
this into a computer network that the

1920
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,520
students have to explore for a

1921
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,039
competition

1922
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,960
um and that's why i mentioned

1923
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,319
gamification earlier

1924
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,640
is stuff like that like there's a lot of

1925
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,559
ways you can make this stuff really cool

1926
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,079
and really fun um but you just gotta

1927
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,400
take take the extra month to really

1928
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,440
leverage it

1929
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,920
i think um you know there's some there's

1930
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,200
some middle ground between

1931
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,480
the the hackers movie uh and real life

1932
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,160
that you can kind of balance it out and

1933
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,839
that really can get the students

1934
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:02,720
attentions quite uh attention quite well

1935
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,640
so i used to be a competitor at

1936
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,319
cyberpatriot for

1937
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:09,119
three years before moving on here so i

1938
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,000
can answer it from both

1939
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,960
sides um what jeremy said about how a

1940
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,480
script can solve it was

1941
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,719
by far the worst part about cyberpatriot

1942
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:17,920
just because

1943
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,439
uh there's very little growth that you

1944
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:20,960
can do you learn how to script something

1945
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,719
you do it and then you kind of just

1946
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:24,158
sitting there looking at each other's

1947
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:26,000
faces for the remainder

1948
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,759
uh the remaining three hours or four

1949
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:29,040
hours

1950
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,238
and there's really not much that you

1951
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:31,920
learned from just being put in front of

1952
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,279
a scenario that you're not allowed to

1953
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,479
really consult anyone

1954
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:35,759
that you can't really talk to anyone

1955
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,158
about other than your team members um

1956
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:39,520
and everything that you do learn by

1957
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,120
talking to them you throw in a script

1958
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,319
and you're done

1959
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,158
um and you're also not there are also

1960
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:45,600
strict rules that prevent you from

1961
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,359
talking to other competitors after the

1962
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,319
fact so

1963
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:49,839
if you have a friend that did way better

1964
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:51,439
than you you're not supposed to talk to

1965
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:52,960
them and

1966
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,319
learn what things you missed with us

1967
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,319
i think we have a more relaxed

1968
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:59,920
requirement in terms of

1969
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,960
not talking to other people and we

1970
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,600
really care about whether you talk to

1971
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,960
someone after the competition because

1972
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,799
we're not going to reuse anything

1973
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,319
so there's definitely more growth in

1974
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:13,679
learning here and everything that we do

1975
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,359
with our competitions or stuff that we

1976
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,759
teach in our previous workshops

1977
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,359
so just by looking at our workshops

1978
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:21,120
themselves we'll have enough

1979
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,759
of a basis for someone to compete and

1980
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,759
learn more during the competition so

1981
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:28,080
people can learn more without having as

1982
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,520
much of a backing

1983
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,640
comparison patriot that's a great answer

1984
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,359
thank you

1985
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,040
i i've been a a mentor um a cyber

1986
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:37,759
patriot

1987
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,479
um i'm not sure well but the california

1988
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,120
part but

1989
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,719
here it was for many low-income

1990
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:46,640
schools that was like the only thing

1991
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,000
they had

1992
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,560
uh so but i wanted to see you know if

1993
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,799
you guys felt for somehow

1994
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:54,880
it seems like you guys have in my

1995
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,480
opinion based on what i hear

1996
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,679
uh augmented your technical experience

1997
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,360
by building this competition so i just

1998
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,800
wanted to see what your opinion was

1999
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,199
about it i i get it now thank you

2000
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:07,280
cyber future is what got me into cyber

2001
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,400
security so

2002
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,400
i can't i mean that's definitely the

2003
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,159
reason why i'm here today

2004
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,719
um but i know that i did not learn

2005
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,480
anything about cyber security after my

2006
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,840
first year as a participant in

2007
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,440
cyberpatriot

2008
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,520
i do want to give one recommendation um

2009
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,080
i think ncl does a lot of things good

2010
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,320
and we tend to get a lot of inspiration

2011
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,640
from their style of challenges

2012
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,640
it's that good mix of uh skills and

2013
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,800
everything all right cool

2014
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,080
good thing i got that head nod i'm being

2015
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,640
opinionated here um

2016
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,800
but uh yeah no it's it's that kind of

2017
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,400
mentality really helps a lot

2018
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,120
um where the challenge is you know

2019
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,239
you're getting towards something here

2020
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,440
instead of just running the script as

2021
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,239
vinay had said

2022
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:47,679
uh i was lucky i didn't get to

2023
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:49,520
participate in cyberpatriot outside of

2024
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:49,920
uh

2025
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,360
being an admin for one of them um

2026
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,480
but yeah i i very much prefer

2027
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,679
critical thinking and collaboration over

2028
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:00,239
just

2029
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:03,280
run this script and done that's

2030
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,120
that's just not what we do in the field

2031
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,960
we don't just do things and then

2032
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,760
and we don't set and forget you know we

2033
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,080
t

2034
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,320
we specifically teach don't sit and

2035
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,440
forget

2036
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,120
and that's what you do in cyber patron

2037
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,040
you said and forget so

2038
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,199
when i was able to make the transition

2039
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,040
out of that game i did it without

2040
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,040
blinking twice

2041
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,040
and that's what helped leverage this

2042
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,120
team because without it

2043
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,800
but if we kept to that contest i

2044
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,480
wouldn't need an entire team to build

2045
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,080
all these kinds of projects and give

2046
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:32,800
them

2047
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,520
that this experience that they have you

2048
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,880
know go at leaving

2049
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,560
cyberpatriot was the best thing because

2050
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,640
it allowed them to learn so much more

2051
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,480
not only these guys to build stuff but

2052
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,199
also

2053
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,560
the students that they support and

2054
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,560
mentor got to see things like

2055
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,600
ncl pico ctf kringlecon and

2056
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,960
our own stuff all in the same year

2057
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,960
i have a question about all these ctfs

2058
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,080
if you don't mind

2059
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,159
um we also do a couple of the ones

2060
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:01,600
you've mentioned um but

2061
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,480
we i just um a few of that you did

2062
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,159
mention that we have not done

2063
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:08,000
so i wanted to hear something of like a

2064
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,840
rating system in terms of what you think

2065
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,960
was most useful

2066
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,560
to you uh learning um of all

2067
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,840
your ctfs and we love ncl by the way

2068
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,040
we do decently too well jeremy said we

2069
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,080
do take inspiration

2070
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,880
out of ncl uh we've also taken

2071
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,239
inspiration from kringlecon and pico

2072
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:30,320
if i was to rate them i would say pico

2073
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,040
is at the bottom of the food chain

2074
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,040
because it is it is meant to be the

2075
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,120
easier one of them all anyway

2076
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,560
since it is geared to middle school and

2077
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,320
high school as an introductory

2078
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,440
game for them so we we've taken

2079
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,640
inspiration from that i would say pico

2080
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,280
ncl kringle con because pringle khan

2081
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,719
assumes you know

2082
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:54,320
already they they're they're um

2083
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,480
the first kringle company they did the

2084
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,239
first challenge was get out of vi

2085
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,360
so you you already need to know some

2086
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,040
linux you already need to know how to

2087
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,080
use things

2088
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,400
to play that game so that's that's

2089
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,080
definitely not a pico level

2090
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,480
you know an entry-level game you need to

2091
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,440
know

2092
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,120
how to use linux to get out of that

2093
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,560
first challenge and

2094
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,679
be able to proceed with the rest uh so i

2095
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:21,280
yeah those three specifically i would

2096
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,920
rank that way

2097
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,920
thanks

2098
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,000
i think just a small comment on that

2099
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,199
would be

2100
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:34,960
just like even just trying to make your

2101
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,040
own ctfs

2102
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:41,120
um i think that would be

2103
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,320
slightly more beneficial than just doing

2104
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,159
a ctf that somebody made

2105
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:47,920
you'd be learning a lot more the

2106
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,840
students will be learning a lot more

2107
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,600
um and then you can just like walk them

2108
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,600
through like oh how do you do this

2109
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,880
how would you hide this or um and then

2110
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,199
having them host to ctf themselves like

2111
01:13:59,199 --> 01:13:59,679
that's

2112
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:02,239
big in itself well that was the context

2113
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:03,679
for my question because i think that's

2114
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,440
like where we're going next

2115
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,280
right how do we create our own

2116
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,480
challenges what do you think is most

2117
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,040
helpful

2118
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,679
um is it too hard to ramp up from like

2119
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:12,400
you know

2120
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,120
ncl or would you start at pico do you

2121
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,400
know what i'm saying

2122
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,040
to then be able to create your own

2123
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,719
challenges and host them yourself

2124
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:23,040
oh i would i would recommend start with

2125
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:23,920
pico

2126
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,199
and see if you can remake their

2127
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,360
questions

2128
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,840
and then do the ncl gym can you remake

2129
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,280
their questions

2130
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,719
because that that's what this team did

2131
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,960
is they looked at those questions

2132
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,719
they they uh theorized how they're made

2133
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,920
and then made their own versions of them

2134
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,440
and then from there branched off

2135
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,239
and did their thing we we make a lot of

2136
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,000
ctfs and it's it uh

2137
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,280
i think to this team now it's just

2138
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,199
second nature oh we're gonna make a ctf

2139
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:51,760
okay

2140
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,280
and just start start doing that but

2141
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,120
that's what we started with was looking

2142
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,960
at how does somebody else do it

2143
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,640
can you do the exact same thing or

2144
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,320
something really similar and then get

2145
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,080
inspiration to continue

2146
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,920
being creative and creating questions on

2147
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,199
your own i would

2148
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:08,640
highly suggest make your own ctf because

2149
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,960
i always tell everybody yes we have in

2150
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,320
our contests we have a first second

2151
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,520
third place winner

2152
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,360
but the true people who learn the most

2153
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,640
are the ones who made it

2154
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,840
and that would be this team

2155
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,199
i do have one more thing to add on to

2156
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:23,440
that as well uh play play video games

2157
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,440
there are certain ones especially uh tis

2158
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,040
100 i know we're using

2159
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,640
what was the assembly one with the

2160
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,400
floating brain that you like a lot of

2161
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,320
irving

2162
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:36,400
squally something like that yeah um

2163
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,880
i absolutely adore hack mud which is a

2164
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,560
bit of an older one

2165
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,320
um and that's command line only

2166
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,320
sadly it's built around javascript which

2167
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,920
uh continuing to be a bit opinionated

2168
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,520
here not so fond of

2169
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:53,199
um but it's this command line only like

2170
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,920
mud which is multi-user dungeon um it

2171
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,520
has these inbuilt challenges that's

2172
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,000
built off of like a cyberpunk 80s era

2173
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,159
internet or maybe 70s era

2174
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:06,080
um but it was it was a lot of fun

2175
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,600
and like i feel myself getting a lot of

2176
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,440
inspiration around that um

2177
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,960
one of our challenges was like how do i

2178
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,800
make how do i make legend of zelda

2179
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,239
breath of the wild

2180
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,239
but with a computer network that the

2181
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,840
students have to explore through and

2182
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:18,480
kind of

2183
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,320
still follow those gameplay philosophies

2184
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,239
of learning more about where they are

2185
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,800
what they're doing acquiring more tools

2186
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,239
and stuff

2187
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,679
um yeah and it's for me at least that's

2188
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,280
something where i come from but i also

2189
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,640
spend way too many hours playing video

2190
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:33,920
games so i just can't pull my head out

2191
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:34,880
of that space so

2192
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,840
uh take it either way i guess hey the

2193
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,080
original hackers were hacking games

2194
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,679
that's what they did so yeah

2195
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:49,839
thanks

2196
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:54,480
and if there's something unofficial you

2197
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,960
want to do you can do like try hack me

2198
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,320
as well um you can also

2199
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,080
make your mini versions of try hack me

2200
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,159
and submit them to try hack me and then

2201
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:06,320
uh you can have other people play them

2202
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,520
yeah i really liked

2203
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,040
some of the try hacking challenges as

2204
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,360
well uh to go off of the

2205
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,800
f society poster um i there there were a

2206
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,640
few of the mr robot ones which i i felt

2207
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,440
really cool

2208
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,719
and they're clacking away because it was

2209
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,560
also just like get to this step

2210
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,040
gets to this step gets to this step done

2211
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,560
and you're kind of left open to it at

2212
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,679
that point

2213
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:31,840
um but yeah that's fun stuff

2214
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,159
i have another question i feel like i'm

2215
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:35,520
just i'm just gonna keep asking

2216
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,320
questions i'm sorry

2217
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,679
i'm not sorry um so

2218
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:42,159
irving you said that it was easy for you

2219
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:43,840
to get

2220
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,880
i guess support for this program

2221
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,480
do you have any advice for people who

2222
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,320
might be facing some resistance

2223
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:56,320
um it wasn't easy to get it off the

2224
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,520
ground

2225
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,360
it was easy once i had i had proof

2226
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,840
that it worked because the like the

2227
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,760
biggest thing that i had

2228
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,840
was getting out of cyber patriots

2229
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,480
getting out of that shadow

2230
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:13,600
and the this this crazy idea

2231
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,520
of doing capture the flags and making

2232
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,960
our own games is that

2233
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,280
better is that more successful will

2234
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,000
students

2235
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,719
cling on to that more than just sticking

2236
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,360
to cyber patriot i had to prove that

2237
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,679
and it took a while because we started

2238
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:31,520
in 2016 it wasn't until 2018

2239
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,440
yeah 18 that we've that we broke off it

2240
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,520
took about two years to break away

2241
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,840
so it took a lot of demonstration a lot

2242
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,560
of tests a lot of uh

2243
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,640
trial and error to get to that point

2244
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,679
where

2245
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:46,000
where the region basically trusted me

2246
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,840
enough to go off

2247
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,400
on my on my tangent that ended up

2248
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,000
bringing these folks

2249
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,199
to the front uh so yeah i would say

2250
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:58,480
um demos i would say trial and errors i

2251
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,080
would say getting getting groups of

2252
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,440
people together

2253
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,840
to make ctfs for other people so for

2254
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:04,800
example

2255
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,920
uh making a game for your local high

2256
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:08,480
school or

2257
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,199
high schools and inviting them over so

2258
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:11,760
your

2259
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,400
you and your team build a ctf and it

2260
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,679
doesn't have to be a difficult one it

2261
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:17,760
can be a very simple one

2262
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,679
and and then inviting them over and

2263
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,440
teaching them how to play and

2264
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,600
showing them you know things like that

2265
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,600
will help build that rapport

2266
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,400
and help build that oh this is something

2267
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,840
serious this is something that can be

2268
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,480
done

2269
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:34,840
and then slowly but surely it will grow

2270
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,760
i credit where it's due because i again

2271
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,440
i had denise to help me

2272
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,760
with with the administrative and

2273
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,760
operations side because again i can do

2274
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,520
all the technical easy

2275
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,040
but i also i i also need a partner to

2276
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,080
help me talk

2277
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,560
to the uh to the other folks who help

2278
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,480
make those decisions and together

2279
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,199
we've expanded this as as far and wide

2280
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,600
as we have

2281
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,000
okay so then really denise you were

2282
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,760
responsible probably for getting like

2283
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,400
the i.t

2284
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,120
team on board not not the students i

2285
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,000
mean like

2286
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,400
i t at school who's probably hesitant

2287
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,520
because oh my god you're going to be

2288
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,920
doing all these things on our boxes

2289
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,120
she helped me with like the deans with

2290
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,440
with the deans with the vps with

2291
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,560
with uh the uh workforce development

2292
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,679
boards with those people

2293
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:27,760
i think they would talk to me they would

2294
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,480
talk to her she would send them my way

2295
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,560
and the in the way that we we got around

2296
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,520
i.t was

2297
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,360
building our our guacamole

2298
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,600
infrastructure

2299
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,920
where i would i could ensure them are

2300
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:40,800
the students

2301
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,080
aren't touching your machines they're

2302
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,520
not doing anything on your local machine

2303
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,360
they're doing something on the cloud

2304
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:50,480
outside of your outside of of your stuff

2305
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,320
yeah we were never friends with it

2306
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,480
a lot of the starting materials

2307
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,320
if i may interject one moment uh ever

2308
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,000
since that one fateful day when i almost

2309
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,679
murdered that lab

2310
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:06,080
oh yeah so yeah we had used their

2311
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,760
facilities for some things but i think

2312
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,440
what really allowed us to like get off

2313
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,400
the floor was

2314
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,280
we had our own subnet that was like a

2315
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,560
little lab environment

2316
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,040
and and that was where i did my first

2317
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:17,760
little run

2318
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,320
with irvin uh for the cyberpatriot stuff

2319
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,280
because that was all

2320
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,120
compartmentalized it was a way they

2321
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,040
didn't have to worry about it

2322
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,960
and then from there we you know with

2323
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,400
added funding we were able to move to

2324
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,040
the cloud

2325
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,040
and just keep it completely divorced

2326
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,159
from whatever the

2327
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:36,719
school wanted i.t to keep control of

2328
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:40,080
um and then you know that exponentially

2329
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:43,840
improved and increased over time

2330
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:45,840
i love that advice i think i'm going to

2331
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,520
circumvent my administration as well

2332
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:47,970
thank you

2333
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:49,840
[Laughter]

2334
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,920
that's what irving is here for literally

2335
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:57,840
just sprinkles

2336
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:06,239
yeah i need to flex those like gcp

2337
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:11,839
skills anyway

2338
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,600
uh there's a question you guys have labs

2339
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,719
coded out

2340
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:22,000
that others can use as a template uh we

2341
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,440
rely a lot on things like netlab where

2342
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,120
things are pre-built

2343
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:30,000
or i try hack me it points students a

2344
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,800
lot to

2345
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:34,239
to burp suite to

2346
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:35,840
various systems that again are all on

2347
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,440
the cloud our

2348
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,639
labs are more of a jump box to help

2349
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:41,920
students because again one of the

2350
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,679
biggest problems that we've that we have

2351
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:44,320
seen

2352
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,639
with our students is they have a machine

2353
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:48,480
that they can't do anything with

2354
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,440
that their user is completely locked

2355
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,239
down

2356
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:54,880
or they're on a chromebook or you know

2357
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,639
they can't access certain sites because

2358
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:57,840
the network firewall

2359
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,800
all of the above so our our jump box

2360
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,000
essentially helps them

2361
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,520
get to anything that that we build so

2362
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,639
for our major contests when we can build

2363
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:10,320
complete infrastructures they can use

2364
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,760
that jump box

2365
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,960
you know they can bring their school

2366
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,040
issue computer use that jump box to

2367
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,480
access our stuff and go from there

2368
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,040
yeah what i was referring to is just

2369
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,159
basically

2370
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:23,760
you know the whole uh network that you

2371
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,520
built up in the cloud you have that

2372
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,639
some you know some sort of cloud

2373
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,120
formation template amazon or

2374
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,960
or i don't know what you guys do it on

2375
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,719
but something that others could use as a

2376
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:35,840
starting point

2377
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,400
not have to kind of recreate everything

2378
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,719
from scratch

2379
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,760
uh kind of but not really uh sometimes

2380
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,239
we have

2381
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:46,880
image templates for whatever we're doing

2382
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,320
if we use it frequently

2383
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,159
we tend we haven't used terraform in the

2384
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:51,840
past that might be something we can do

2385
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:52,960
in the future

2386
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,320
uh but for the most part our

2387
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,239
infrastructures are used for

2388
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:58,800
three days so we pull it up manually and

2389
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,239
then we're done with it so we don't

2390
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:00,639
really

2391
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:03,040
invest time into doing terraform or

2392
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,040
anything else

2393
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,719
and it's usually just the p boxes right

2394
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,239
it's not a whole lot a lot of them

2395
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:11,199
yeah so our infrastructure itself is

2396
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:11,920
usually only

2397
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,920
two or three boxes there's been i think

2398
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,440
one exception to that

2399
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,760
uh and then our students use guac-bot to

2400
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,679
request their own instances so

2401
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,480
yeah okay yeah that means definitely can

2402
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,520
get a bit big

2403
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,760
that was fun opening up gcp over summer

2404
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,159
camp and seeing a hundred vms in our

2405
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:31,920
on our gcp uh cloud

2406
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,960
compute engine stuff

2407
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,280
yeah that was another massive reason

2408
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,280
that the guac bot was so helpful

2409
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,600
was because again being there for the

2410
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,880
summer camp

2411
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,760
it was really hard to manage 120

2412
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,600
different vms that were all very

2413
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,960
necessary to do with the different

2414
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,560
sections of the camp

2415
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:55,040
uh and also it's it's not cost effective

2416
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,800
uh we needed to provide the students

2417
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,120
with

2418
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,120
access to these things but we were on a

2419
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,159
budget and

2420
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:02,560
and we only had so many hands to take

2421
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:03,840
care of it

2422
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,800
so you know the improvements with our

2423
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,600
infrastructure

2424
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,719
not to say we didn't have any

2425
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:10,719
infrastructure before i

2426
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:13,840
think we're huge

2427
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,600
yeah i wanted to add on to that i mean

2428
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,880
i'm just trying to give like everybody

2429
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,800
here some kind of like lency

2430
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,600
just because we had like maybe like two

2431
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,840
or three months to get all this up from

2432
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,600
up and running into the cloud

2433
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,520
so we're all in a rush because right

2434
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,280
after cove it has started we needed to

2435
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,040
figure out what to do right

2436
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,520
so there were some like like cost

2437
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,120
efficiency issues

2438
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,040
um but we would have needed more time

2439
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,840
for that

2440
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,880
yeah like most people the switchover

2441
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,120
when the pandemic started was

2442
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:52,320
gave us all a brand new challenge of how

2443
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,159
how do we do what we normally do

2444
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:57,360
completely cloud-based and and though we

2445
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,120
were already transitioning into the

2446
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,639
cloud that really

2447
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:02,960
pushed us over the edge to not only

2448
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,320
provide our

2449
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,920
our training materials that we normally

2450
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,080
do our resources but also

2451
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,040
think future wise so build for the

2452
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:11,520
present

2453
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,719
and the future at the same time uh to

2454
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,600
keep supporting our entire program and

2455
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,440
they did it they did it wonderfully

2456
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,960
couldn't have uh

2457
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,560
could have asked for more out of this

2458
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,800
team

2459
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,719
awesome guys you guys are heroes in your

2460
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:30,159
own right i know it was

2461
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:33,840
a hard transition for everyone and um

2462
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,320
congratulations erwin and your team here

2463

you know like just

2472
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,480
whatever you go create your group pass

2473
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,920
it pass it forward that's

2474
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,000
that's usually what i tell people uh

2475
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,920
once you you're in an organization like

2476
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:04,880
for example this is

2477
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,159
it's very um i think it's amazing what

2478
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:08,639
what

2479
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:11,280
uh what urban has achieved and you guys

2480
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,560
have achieved

2481
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,120
uh passive power there are other people

2482
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,239
in need

2483
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:19,679
of uh help uh for individuals like you

2484
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:21,840
so don't stop at your job

2485
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,520
um you know there are there are

2486
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,760
organizations like uh what we have right

2487
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:26,239
now that

2488
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:28,960
here pacific hackers or whatever you go

2489
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:29,520
join it

2490
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,800

we always we always meet up and

2530
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:09,520
um try to strategize right you can't

2531
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,600
play everything there's there are teams

2532
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,280
there are people already preparing to do

2533
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,520
what we're talking about

2534
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,760
and like i think it was jeremy that said

2535
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,360
you know usually we

2536
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,000
um we party too much so we start playing

2537
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,040
we do well

2538
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,040
we're like i'm not staying overnight

2539
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,560
playing this then we'll go to party then

2540
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,480
when we come back oh crap we're fifth

2541
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,600
and six now

2542
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,040
so it's that decision you have to make

2543
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:33,520
right

2544
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,159
um but you know getting a black batch is

2545
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:39,839
a big deal

2546
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,600
uh do you have a a question amy

2547
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,040
oh no no i was just saying that i'm

2548
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,800
going to reach out offline i guess about

2549
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,560
network architecture

2550
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,080
to see how i can possibly replicate a

2551
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,679
similar environment i had not even

2552
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,120
thought i don't know why like

2553
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:58,800
i have all these clouds like i

2554
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,000
i know cloud why didn't i think of that

2555
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
i've had this barrier that it you know

2556
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
with the school

2557
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,080
