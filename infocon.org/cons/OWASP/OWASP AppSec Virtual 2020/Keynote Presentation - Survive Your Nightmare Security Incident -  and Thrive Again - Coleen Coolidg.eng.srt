colleen coolidge is the cso at segment

21
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,320
in san francisco building holistic

22
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,479
security and trust programs to protect

23
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,000
customer data

24
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,720
previously she was at twilio as senior

25
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,680
director of trust and security

26
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,000
one of colleen's goals is to advance the

27
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,400
security culture past just having some

28
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,479
infrastructure people doing it to

29
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,880
creating a comprehensive program where

30
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,120
everyone in the company feels ownership

31
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,960
and works to improve the company's

32
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,440
security posture each year

33
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,199
she believes that every customer

34
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,680
deserves to have a security organization

35
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
who's advocating for the protection of

36
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,199
their data

37
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,199
she has been called a true advocate for

38
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,120
customer security and i'm excited to

39
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,800
hear what she has to say

40
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,720
please welcome colleen coolidge

41
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,440
surviving a big security incident and

42
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,919
emerging in one piece on the other side

43
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,680
can feel like a miniature version of the

44
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
year 2020.

45
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,919
for me 2020 has shaped it to be a

46
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,639
completely unfun haunted house

47
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,479
with zero exits

48
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,639
and while the danger the loss and the

49
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,120
depression of a security incident is

50
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,080
nowhere near actual 2020 scale

51
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,479
the way that the public your company or

52
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,280
you treat yourself can feel like it is

53
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
for a short time anyway

54
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,960
my name is colleen coolidge and i lead

55
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,080
security at bay area startups

56
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,440
today we'll be covering

57
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
so first the relationship between

58
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,520
vacations holidays and security

59
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,560
incidents

60
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,400
and we'll take a look at an incident in

61
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,880
my team and i have to deal with

62
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,639
then we'll reflect on what a security

63
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,479
incident feels like

64
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,520
what it can do to any healthy happy team

65
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,680
and what we can do to crawl out of that

66
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,880
hole

67
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,120
next we'll be talking about specific

68
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,240
practical

69
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,960
fight back tactics ones my team and i

70
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,680
have been using successfully

71
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,000
finally we'll broaden the conversation

72
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,360
talking about how to support the

73
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,520
security community around us

74
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,280
we all have security friends working at

75
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,599
different places

76
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,759
so let's set the stage and start by

77
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,039
talking about

78
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,400
vacations

79
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,039
and holidays

80
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,400
ah

81
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,599
vacations

82
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,199
the holidays

83
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,440
not doing any stressful work

84
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,639
in fact your only job on a vacation

85
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,639
should be to relax

86
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,360
what these children feel is what we want

87
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
to feel on our vacation

88
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,680
you just want to be able to let go

89
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,720
but

90
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
we're security people and while others

91
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,800
fully enjoy their time off playing in

92
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,080
the snow

93
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
savoring the end of their fun-filled day

94
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,240
with a cup of hot cocoa

95
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,639
and then sleeping soundly

96
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,400
security people worry about incidents

97
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,120
that destroy vacations and so chaos at

98
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,400
work

99
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,680
however we all still weirdly plan on

100
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,039
taking time off i'm guilty of it myself

101
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,680
in fact the days leading up to the time

102
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,280
off we even bring out all of our

103
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,199
superstitious practices to protect that

104
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,479
time off

105
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,159
we knock on wood

106
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,559
a little more we immediately chastise

107
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,799
co-workers who make flippant unjaded

108
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,279
comments like hey it's pretty quiet this

109
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,479
week

110
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,839
this my friends

111
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,120
is leftover trauma for security people

112
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,200
for when we do take time off there's

113
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,600
this lurking fear at the base of our

114
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,480
holiday enjoyment

115
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,440
and of course

116
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,360
we should have known there would be a

117
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,279
giant security incident looming as we

118
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,040
neared the sunny and beautiful home

119
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,279
stretch of labor day weekend 2019.

120
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,800
not because of the vulnerabilities that

121
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,279
are on the list to get fixed

122
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,560
that list that every security

123
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,720
practitioner carries on their backs

124
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,839
but because the timing was quote holiday

125
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,040
weekend 2019 end quote

126
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,440
for those folks not from the u.s labor

127
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
day weekend is our last hurrah for

128
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,560
summer

129
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,720
when the weather's warm barbecues are

130
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,839
fired up beaches get crowded and people

131
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,920
including security people

132
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,600
try to avoid work

133
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
a few on-call engineers are holding down

134
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
the fort and working

135
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,760
but even when that on-call engineer is

136
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,000
you you still try to make plans with

137
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,760
your family and friends after you do a

138
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,519
bit of work you just hope things are

139
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,200
quiet

140
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,440
and for us we were closing out a great

141
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,920
week our iso 2701 paperwork was done

142
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,320
i was making an offer to a candidate

143
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,560
and we were making awesome progress on

144
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,518
our quarterly goals

145
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,839
then this

146
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,399
happens

147
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,240
have you ever had to write one of these

148
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,160
bulletins and emails in your security

149
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
career

150
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,839
unfortunately i've had to help write a

151
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,160
couple of these in my security career

152
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,279
they're not really fun

153
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,959
someone on our engineering team had

154
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,320
their account taken over by an

155
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,560
unauthorized user

156
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,640
this unauthorized user was able to look

157
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,800
around and see information about how our

158
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,320
business customers

159
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
used our app

160
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,640
that user could see business contact and

161
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,200
usage information however

162
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,600
that user could not see customer end

163
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,120
user information

164
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,920
but it still majorly sucked

165
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,079
one of the many lamentable points about

166
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,560
this account takeover was that

167
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,040
locking down these accounts more

168
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,040
was already an agreed upon okr for the

169
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,640
upcoming quarter

170
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,360
we had a security story for it but we

171
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,160
were eight to 12 weeks too slow on

172
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,480
mitigating that particular story

173
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
if we're looking at the incident

174
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,160
timeline

175
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,160
digging into the bulletin a little bit

176
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,040
more

177
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,320
well we wanted to include details like

178
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,800
when did we learn about this of course

179
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,880
over the course of a holiday

180
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,959
what data did it involve

181
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,959
business contact data business usage

182
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,160
data

183
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,839
one important point to emphasize in the

184
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,200
bulletin was

185
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,360
with our business customers there was no

186
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,480
end user customer data which is a very

187
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,000
small win but

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,839
you know we'll take it

189
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,839
going to the last part of the bulletin

190
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,480
we felt we needed to include a moving

191
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,839
forward section

192
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,839
to talk about our immediate steps and

193
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,240
then our near-term steps to prevent this

194
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,760
scary story from happening again

195
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,320
we decided against talking about more

196
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,160
distant and future

197
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
big security plans or that long-term

198
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,160
remediation if only things fell into

199
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,560
place and one or two years later because

200
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,440
putting ourselves in our customers shoes

201
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,880
it's just not the right time to talk

202
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,720
about big plans

203
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,839
it's about time to rebuild trust

204
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,079
and talking about big plans right now

205
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,079
which is sound like a bunch of empty

206
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,839
promises that nobody wants to hear

207
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,519
instead of a concise near-term list to

208
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,720
hold us all accountable

209
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
and a final note about security

210
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,959
bulletins that you have to write for

211
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,160
incidents

212
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,000
if your team ever has to write one of

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,440
these

214
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,360
you'll know that it's an art

215
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,639
it's also a very chaotic experience

216
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,000
imagine this at least one representative

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,040
from every involved team think your

218
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,120
extended security team

219
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,200
legal department and probably legal

220
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,560
department including people from all

221
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,240
over the world depending on how public

222
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,399
this is and where the information is

223
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,200
your pr team customer success

224
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,480
engineering

225
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,399
and the exec team

226
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,720
all of them in one room well virtually

227
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,839
nowadays

228
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,320
they have to review the language the

229
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,600
story the order the everything lots of

230
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
cooks in the kitchen

231
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,279
add that on top of having to deal with

232
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,440
an incident

233
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,680
in any case after this draft has gone

234
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,360
through everyone's review and edits and

235
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,120
then everyone is mildly happy and

236
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,639
unhappy with it and it's ready to be

237
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,800
published and sent to customers

238
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,279
it's not actually recognizable as the

239
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,120
draft that your team originally wrote

240
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,040
so to recap the labor day holiday that

241
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,760
we had last year we all went from

242
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,839
thinking we were going to enjoy the

243
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,120
labor day holiday and a long weekend

244
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,880
with lots of fun stuff that we'd all

245
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,320
planned

246
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,160
two

247
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,920
working on this incident

248
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
and continuing to work through the long

249
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,639
tail of each cleanup piece and every

250
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,440
type of communication with everyone

251
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,680
including very angry customers who are

252
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,639
disappointed that you've made a mistake

253
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,639
it seemed like all the pieces just kept

254
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,320
cycling around and around that's what it

255
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,480
felt like being inside of a whirlwind

256
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,800
with the pieces flying by

257
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,480
well that's normal security incident

258
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,800
mitigation and remediation and when your

259
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,320
security incident becomes public

260
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,240
knowledge this is what's going to happen

261
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,519
people agree

262
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,800
about the

263
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,399
steps that are needed to resolve an

264
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,880
incident like this but people don't talk

265
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,519
about the emotional and energy drain

266
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,000
that is that your team experiences and

267
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,680
the remediation needed for that

268
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,160
remediation here might look like

269
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,839
hiring more people to spread the work

270
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,959
around

271
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,120
forcing people to take vacations so that

272
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
they can recover

273
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,440
addressing the mood of the company and

274
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,000
your team in particular rewarding teens

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,480
who put in a lot of extra time and work

276
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
providing their favorite lunch or dinner

277
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,560
or something else and reminding them

278
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,639
that we have mental health professionals

279
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,360
to address feelings of anxiety

280
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,000
guilt and burnout which every security

281
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,120
person experiences during this time

282
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,600
and also some remediation is that

283
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,920
leaders should resolve to find ways to

284
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,680
fight that

285
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,719
but more on that later

286
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,480
so you know what

287
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,199
no matter how bad any security incident

288
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,920
is how terrible it is how much sleep

289
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,360
you've lost

290
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,680
it always comes to an end

291
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,519
and you will start having little bits of

292
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,680
time to start thinking clearly once

293
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,839
again

294
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,920
i think this can be a helpful exercise

295
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,000
for those of you who weathered a large

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,920
security incident and for those of you

297
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,360
who haven't yet

298
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,959
fair warning

299
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,519
i don't think i can 100

300
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,279
put you back to normal and into a

301
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,360
functional state after this but i will

302
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,240
try

303
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,800
so let's dive in

304
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,440
do you feel haunted by the specter of

305
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,279
future security incidents because the

306
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,440
previous ones that you've had

307
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
or because you're very aware of where

308
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,360
all the unaddressed vulnerabilities in

309
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,759
your company are and you're just waiting

310
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,880
for these ticking time bombs to go off

311
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,320
well in your mind

312
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,639
bring up that big public security

313
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,639
incident

314
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,160
and if you can

315
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,560
note down your feelings when you imagine

316
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,360
that incident happening to you right now

317
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,560
at the company where you work

318
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,000
are you starting to shut down

319
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,360
are you starting to sort of mentally

320
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,800
move away from it because it's really

321
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,199
uncomfortable and you can't sit with it

322
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,440
well would your co-workers shut down

323
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,120
during this exercise people who you need

324
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,320
these feelings that you're having

325
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
are like what happens to you when you

326
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,160
enter a nightmare

327
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,240
that haunted house

328
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,560
you feel cursed you feel like you can't

329
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,639
escape no matter how much you want to

330
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,759
escape

331
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,839
you start reverting to a more primitive

332
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,440
mode

333
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,519
for us when this happened to us we

334
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,680
absolutely felt like the unluckiest

335
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,759
security people we knew that we'd

336
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,440
entered a haunted house and we couldn't

337
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,640
get out

338
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,839
and

339
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,079
we felt like we were all alone

340
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,079
no one was going to help us and the

341
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,240
situation was going to grow more dire by

342
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
the hour and we just had to get through

343
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,400
it

344
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,119
you can also feel like

345
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,520
you're in this constant state of panic

346
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,160
and you ping pong between mild panic and

347
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,480
severe panic depending on the hour

348
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,160
depending on what's uncovered during the

349
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,320
course of the incident

350
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,160
you might start to feel like you're

351
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,200
losing your grip on reality

352
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,320
for us

353
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,760
due to the height and stress that we

354
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,840
endured for many weeks

355
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,840
none of us were sleeping more than just

356
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,240
a few hours a night

357
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,160
we had trouble concentrating during the

358
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,240
day when we were at work

359
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,360
we doubted ourselves and our judgment

360
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,960
we felt depressed

361
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,720
and we felt like we were very bad at our

362
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,160
jobs

363
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,760
we definitely felt like there would be

364
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,000
no survivors

365
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,600
you may feel like

366
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,440
you're all going to be punished

367
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,360
security scarlet letter

368
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,440
wearing it on your chest

369
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,039
or even worse

370
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,120
you know this feels like it's a stain

371
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,520
that can't be removed from your your

372
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,679
reputation your team's reputation and

373
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,080
your company's reputation your customers

374
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,919
are disappointed in you how could you do

375
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,760
this

376
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,280
well we definitely felt like the other

377
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,200
shoe was going to drop for us and that

378
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,640
something else scary was coming for us

379
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,880
every single person working the incident

380
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,160
somehow felt

381
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,919
inexplicably personally responsible

382
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,679
and we felt like there was no end in

383
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,000
sight with all of the mitigations the

384
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,080
customer and internal comms

385
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
and all the process improvement changes

386
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,830
that we needed to make and make quickly

387
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,880
[Music]

388
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,280
the nightmare security incident itself

389
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,200
isn't even the worst thing about all

390
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,799
this

391
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,799
the worst thing is you remain in its

392
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,679
grip

393
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,160
repeatedly suffering as its victim

394
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,840
and you can't fight back

395
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,400
it just beats you down

396
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,840
so it's important to recognize that

397
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,160
there are near-term emotional and mental

398
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,799
mental dangers from security incidents

399
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,400
you might be

400
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,240
burning out in the security field

401
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,280
overall

402
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,960
and that's terrible because we need each

403
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,559
and every one of you there's a shortage

404
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,640
of security people please don't quit

405
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,559
when this happens

406
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,480
you might be fearing the next incident

407
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,360
so much that the effective steps aren't

408
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,280
taken to deal with the next one you're

409
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,000
essentially hiding from it

410
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,559
and then another danger is not learning

411
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,400
and growing from this experience

412
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,640
as terrible as it is it is a valuable

413
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,960
learning experience for everyone and it

414
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,400
is not the end of the world even though

415
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,240
it feels like it

416
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,760
so what you need to do is you need to

417
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,480
break that fear cycle and eventually

418
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,400
capitalize on all the bad things that

419
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,440
happen

420
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,520
yes i said it you are allowed to

421
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,840
capitalize on all the bad things that

422
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,280
happen

423
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,480
and we did eventually do that

424
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,280
but

425
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,840
if you or your team are really damaged

426
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,000
from the incident experience

427
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,640
can you just easily switch from being

428
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,280
scared and mitigating to the offensive

429
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,480
side

430
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,720
is that even possible

431
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,919
no

432
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,520
you should not immediately jump to the

433
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,480
offense

434
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,120
if your team or you is damaged and

435
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,400
limping away from the security incident

436
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,320
also i i thought i was gonna give us all

437
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,919
a break from the intense and haunted

438
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,320
imagery of the last group of slides

439
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,559
since we are moving into a more

440
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,520
uplifting part

441
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,360
so you thought you could just go on the

442
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,799
offense here

443
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,360
what were you thinking you don't drain

444
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,520
the cooked rice and then rinse the

445
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,720
cooked rice

446
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,559
just like you don't rush into your ass

447
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,880
kicking phase before you repair the

448
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,039
emotional damage that the big security

449
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,600
incident can cause you or your team

450
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,320
how effective can you or your team be if

451
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,919
you're feeling tired

452
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,840
anxious guilty scared or depressed

453
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,600
i don't know but you're better off if

454
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,879
you resolve some of that first

455
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,640
now i know there's this huge stigma

456
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,720
against talking about one's own mental

457
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,120
health in both western and eastern

458
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,240
families

459
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,159
i know because i occupy both

460
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,000
simultaneously

461
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,080
and i'm here to break that by stepping

462
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,240
you through my own process

463
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,400
bolstering myself against security job

464
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,320
pressure and that pressure is the

465
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,200
cumulative effect of incidents and other

466
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,799
things that happen that slight a

467
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,440
security person's spirit

468
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,280
so let's normalize this stuff by talking

469
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,000
about it shall we

470
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,520
oh and yes

471
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,200
there is an app for that

472
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,360
actually there are several if you check

473
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,200
out the google play store or the app

474
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,760
store there are tons of apps that can

475
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,960
help you

476
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,280
you don't have to walk into a 1950s

477
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,080
psychologist office and lay on a couch

478
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,880
and

479
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,320
nowadays it's probably not safe to do

480
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,760
that anyway

481
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,919
my employer happens to provide access to

482
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,240
a mental wellness app called ginger just

483
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,159
happens to be the one that we use but

484
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,240
these types of tools are great for

485
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,320
security people particularly security

486
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,640
people suffering from incident trauma

487
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,360
if your employer doesn't cover this

488
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,880
get a better employer i'm serious

489
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,640
and before you start worrying about my

490
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,400
mental health privacy

491
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,039
you should know that i don't care

492
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,799
there is way too much hand-wringing and

493
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,039
protecting going on that's preventing

494
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,440
society and people who need help from

495
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,600
moving forward like we all be able we

496
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
should be able to do

497
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,400
and outdated prohibitions and ideas

498
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
really just exacerbate the problem they

499
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
keep us in the dark they keep us a

500
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,720
victim

501
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,640
so the following is my own experience

502
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,159
and i'm happy to share the results with

503
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,919
you

504
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,840
so i recently opened the app and did

505
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,320
another mental health checkup and it

506
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,640
really is this easy

507
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,039
for those of you who feel mortified by

508
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,559
the very thought of taking your first

509
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,720
steps toward good mental health

510
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,200
you can close your bedroom door

511
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,039
you can bust out the mobile app and you

512
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,799
can do your check-in in the privacy of

513
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,520
your own bedroom

514
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,799
this one is as easy as answering 16

515
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,480
questions by reading and clicking

516
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,080
through

517
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,880
these questions pertain to

518
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,039
my level of interest doing anything over

519
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,360
the past couple of weeks as well as

520
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,799
remembering how many days i felt down

521
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,559
it's been a challenging month i'm not

522
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,039
gonna lie

523
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,799
and these questions are about my mood

524
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,360
sleep quality and energy levels and

525
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,320
actually

526
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,400
these answers are normal for me they're

527
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,240
not really that much of a departure it's

528
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,640
just who i am

529
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,720
and these questions are about appetite

530
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,960
issues yeah like asking about overeating

531
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,559
or not eating enough

532
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,960
um and also feeling like a failure is

533
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,559
that a feeling that you carry with you

534
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,080
for me unfortunately that's a yes

535
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,159
now these questions are about having

536
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,400
trouble concentrating which i was a bit

537
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,919
and then there are questions about

538
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,480
feeling restless or noticeably slower

539
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,760
than normal

540
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,480
this one wasn't so pronounced

541
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,080
yeah small wins here and there

542
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,799
this question covers self-harm and happy

543
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,080
to report that i'm okay here today

544
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,559
um the other question covers whether i'm

545
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,960
experiencing feelings of anxiety or

546
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,480
edginess

547
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,919
there are definitely a few days that i

548
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,840
can recall experiencing these feelings

549
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,799
both of these questions pertain to

550
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,120
out of control worrying

551
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
and i'd like to remind all of us that

552
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,120
security people are in general just at

553
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,799
higher risk for various mental health

554
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,000
concerns

555
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,440
and that we should pay closer attention

556
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,640
to that i would say that as a class of

557
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,279
of employees we probably fit into this

558
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,000
particular category most of all

559
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,799
sometimes i wonder whether the job makes

560
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,080
us this way

561
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,480
or whether the job attracts those of us

562
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,760
who are already this way and uh before

563
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,440
we joined security we were just worrying

564
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,640
for free

565
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,559
and now we get paid for it

566
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,320
both of these questions have to do with

567
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,720
not being able to relax

568
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,120
and feeling restless

569
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,840
in a post-covered world i'm planning on

570
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,720
taking a very long vacation so that the

571
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,400
answer to this question

572
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,200
on the trouble relaxing thing goes from

573
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,360
nearly every day to

574
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,678
not at all or maybe even never again

575
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,240
this last question i was able to show

576
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,799
asks about feeling easily annoyed or

577
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,159
irritable

578
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,120
now i'm not really sure if that is

579
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,520
specifically a mental health question it

580
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,480
just sounds like who i am as a person um

581
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,320
also sounds like a number of people that

582
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,200
i know

583
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,880
so to me it wasn't that helpful or

584
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,240
insightful

585
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,559
and question 16 where there is a

586
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,240
question mark um

587
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,320
is not accessible to grab the results as

588
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,400
i was going through the app the downside

589
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,640
was since it was the last question

590
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,120
i had to advance it and then go back so

591
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,960
that i could see my tick mark but since

592
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,640
it was the last question i instead saw

593
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,159
this

594
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,520
it took me to my results page

595
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,440
which is almost instant gratification

596
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,960
which is the great thing about mobile

597
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,840
apps

598
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
the results on this check-in

599
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,919
make me think that this

600
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,000
tracks with a lot of security

601
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,679
professionals

602
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,679
the insights provided show that the

603
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,240
anxiety i'm experiencing means it's

604
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,559
nearly impossible for me to relax on a

605
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,120
day-to-day basis

606
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,080
and while not on a day-to-day basis i do

607
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,960
experience feelings of failure

608
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,120
honestly i feel like i let my team down

609
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,640
in important ways from time to time

610
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,960
i wish that i could shield them even

611
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,760
more than i do but sometimes and even

612
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,720
more so this year than other years

613
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,559
there are days where i feel like i am

614
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,799
just hanging on

615
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,960
and outside of work i'm not spending

616
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,880
enough time with the people i love my

617
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,400
friends and family have noted that i'm

618
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,640
spending way too much time at work

619
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,240
and they're just hoping for that break

620
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,600
that never comes

621
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,840
and that makes me feel guilty as well

622
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,039
so what i love about this app is it

623
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,880
doesn't just leave you in a lurch with

624
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,720
something you already suspected about

625
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
yourself anyway sure i know i have

626
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
problems and i could be doing things

627
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,480
better and i feel bad about how things

628
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,279
are

629
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,679
in my case it's prompting me to address

630
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,799
my issues by keeping a positive evidence

631
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,840
diary

632
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,760
it's saying when i'm experiencing these

633
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,000
feelings i have a tendency to over

634
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,039
notice or only notice negative things in

635
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,159
my life

636
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,200
it's like

637
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,399
my negative mood is a magnet to notice

638
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,799
only what's going wrong with everything

639
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,000
and everyone

640
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,120
unchecked

641
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,399
this is something that could just get

642
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,880
much worse over time for those of you

643
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
who know me personally you know that i

644
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,919
have

645
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,080
a strangely sunny disposition for the

646
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,360
number of years i've been leading

647
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,559
security

648
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,399
but this year is definitely getting to

649
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,799
me it's starting to diminish the sun

650
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,120
just a bit

651
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,960
so to combat that i've been capturing

652
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,000
small medium and large successes every

653
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,240
week

654
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,000
from a notebook that i keep near my work

655
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,559
laptop where i can scribble notes

656
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,039
here is a selection of my favorite

657
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,520
positive evidence diary entries over the

658
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,200
last week

659
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,679
the first two are small wins that i

660
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,279
associate with my work

661
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,200
i feel very guilty when i don't stay on

662
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,679
top of the work tasks because primarily

663
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,279
that's what i get paid for stay on top

664
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,279
of these tasks

665
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,120
the third one is something that i do for

666
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,960
my relationships health it's really

667
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,120
important security people

668
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,279
hold the people who love you very close

669
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,840
treat them well

670
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,760
the fourth and fifth ones are wins that

671
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,840
are associated with physical health and

672
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,679
mental health

673
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,760
and in particular the guided meditation

674
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,520
for sleep has helped a little bit with

675
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,200
some of my sleep issues and i highly

676
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,159
recommend that

677
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,320
and this week i'm added i'm going to add

678
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,159
here that i completed a recent check-in

679
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,600
on the app

680
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,080
small win

681
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,880
now that we're on the road to recovery

682
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,440
from the security incident damage

683
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,320
we could be persuaded to start fighting

684
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,559
back

685
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,799
instead of remaining incident victims

686
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,520
our team really needed to ensure that we

687
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,840
had an effective way to drive meaningful

688
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,960
changes all the time and not just in

689
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,960
starts and fits

690
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,799
existing weaknesses in our security

691
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,279
story that weren't fixed fast enough

692
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,200
you know that's part of it it's always a

693
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
struggle to get everyone in the company

694
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,080
on the same page that security is

695
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,520
but have you considered what your

696
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,159
security asks which are probably

697
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,120
large

698
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,880
what they look like from a product

699
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,279
team's point of view

700
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,840
they care about customer stories

701
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,600
and while engineers you deal with may

702
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,120
understand the need to address a

703
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,840
vulnerability without the context of a

704
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,279
scary story

705
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,200
product managers

706
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,480
not so much

707
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,039
so give them the kind of nightmare story

708
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,039
that keeps you up at night

709
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,120
walk them through your scenarios why

710
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,240
should you

711
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,440
a security person be the only one

712
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,840
worrying about the haunted house

713
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,399
no

714
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,320
in your scary stories be sure to

715
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,039
reference tickets that's a big red

716
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,320
marker there

717
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,240
tickets should all link back to your

718
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,399
stores so the person who's scheduling

719
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,880
the work for the sprint so probably not

720
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,399
the person doing the work not an

721
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,640
engineer

722
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,880
or even the person who is doing the work

723
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,919
these folks understand exactly how that

724
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:58,720
work

725
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,600
fits into eliminating that scary story

726
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
there's nothing like being able to

727
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,960
connect the dots for others so you don't

728
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,200
sound like a raving security person who

729
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,440
wants everything fixed you actually have

730
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,679
a clear and concise story and show how

731
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,519
everything is linked people like that

732
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,039
and keep it going

733
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,039
keep creating stories for everything

734
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,760
that stresses you out the great thing

735
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,080
about these stories is you can create an

736
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,760
entire collection

737
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,679
and you can build

738
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,519
related quarterly goals

739
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,480
and themes off of all of them in making

740
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,519
these stories absolutely make sure the

741
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,360
collection has story material that

742
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,679
reflects your learnings from previous

743
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:40,720
incidents

744
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,240
whether they're your incidents that

745
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,760
you've had to deal with or other

746
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,720
companies incidents in the news think of

747
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,760
it as

748
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,720
journaling your fears and getting paid

749
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,440
for working through your trauma

750
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,279
we do

751
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,519
you can continue using this collection

752
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,919
to help teams drive multi-year road maps

753
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,440
and make significant progress

754
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,760
company-wide

755
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,840
your company might even be proud enough

756
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840
of everyone's progress that they would

757
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,600
ask you to prevent present at their

758
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,440
annual conference

759
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,120
as i mentioned earlier

760
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,159
insure tickets track this work

761
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,399
the tickets represent vulnerabilities

762
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,240
and they are great because you can

763
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,600
report off of them

764
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,200
so how did we do when it came to that

765
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,919
well it's not the fanciest system you

766
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,240
know it's it's just another spreadsheet

767
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,960
favorite tool of everyone but we realize

768
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,039
that creating tickets for our stores

769
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,279
without reporting on their progress

770
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,640
without showing metrics of who's late

771
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,279
and who's not means that all the lights

772
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,799
are still off in the haunted house

773
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,120
stepping back a bit it's not as though

774
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
zero work was done in security before

775
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,960
the incident happened for us we'd

776
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,200
actually done a lot

777
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,600
of work in the relatively small amount

778
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,679
of time that we were at the company

779
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,600
education and security design reviews

780
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
had been in place for a couple of years

781
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,159
the team layered in some help for eng

782
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,080
teams in the form of automation to

783
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,919
locate and help fix the vulnerabilities

784
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,760
at different layers of the stack

785
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,320
there was a big ownership push to figure

786
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,120
out what belonged to whom

787
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,880
you know there were things that made it

788
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,120
easier for eng teams to keep on top of

789
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,120
their vulnerability backlog those things

790
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,480
did happen

791
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,360
but education reviews and tickets aren't

792
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,399
enough

793
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,799
you have to turn on all the lights to

794
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,640
see how the vulnerability backlog is

795
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,000
being addressed department by department

796
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,279
you might be thinking from this

797
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,720
screenshot

798
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,039
that as soon as weekly metrics are put

799
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,120
into a spreadsheet vulnerabilities

800
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,440
magically start to self-heal

801
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,720
but then you would be wrong

802
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,080
because

803
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,559
you know who is just as interested in

804
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,000
you are in the state of your

805
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,760
vulnerability management

806
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,399
your exec team or they better be

807
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,799
oh yes they do have the time to read

808
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,120
your carefully curated email

809
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,799
telling them exactly what they need to

810
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,559
know and what part of the organization

811
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,040
is struggling to meet its commitments

812
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,520
for vulnerability management aka product

813
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,599
quality that's what it is

814
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,440
and this is something that we do

815
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,918
weekly

816
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,839
you know who else should be just as

817
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,000
interested as exec and vulnerabilities

818
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,679
that could cause a public security

819
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,639
incident

820
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,719
you're bored

821
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,399
the security org at your company also

822
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,480
has the job of ensuring the board

823
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
understands the state of your company's

824
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,119
weaknesses in plain language

825
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,520
also the board can help you with

826
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,000
potential conflicts of interest maybe um

827
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,199
there's something going on with

828
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,719
securities reporting line maybe there's

829
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,480
something weirdly political

830
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,639
uh you know who does security report to

831
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,079
is it someone who's just trying to make

832
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,918
themselves look good

833
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,560
is your security messaging your warnings

834
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,800
is all of that being squelched at any

835
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,320
level

836
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,359
the board is obligated to hear you or

837
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,520
your security org's rep

838
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,599
and provide help when management does

839
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,119
not help you

840
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,200
your security org should get an audience

841
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,520
with the board if they don't already

842
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,000
know what's going on

843
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,599
make sure your message doesn't go

844
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,599
through

845
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,920
kind of like this soviet era redaction

846
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,520
techniques either

847
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,440
if you find that this is happening to

848
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,680
you and your security org

849
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,200
since you have the strength now because

850
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,040
you took care of yourself

851
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,960
you need to fight back

852
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,040
or if you think the fight isn't worth it

853
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,200
find a better environment in which you

854
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,960
can practice your security

855
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,480
more about that a little later

856
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,640
going back to that same vulnerability

857
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
management spreadsheet where we show

858
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,680
metrics

859
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,200
you should notice that there are

860
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,680
additional departments listed on here

861
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,720
not just engineering teams so you'll see

862
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,480
hr and finance and facilities

863
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,800
the security org cannot take credit for

864
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,720
that we're pretty good but we're not

865
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,440
that awesome that awesome move

866
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,880
of starting to measure security

867
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,640
vulnerabilities in every department

868
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,440
across the company was the idea of our

869
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,359
ceo peter

870
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,200
he asked for this

871
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,119
he liked the weekly emails the

872
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,000
distillation and visibility so much

873
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,839
that he asked us to start tracking all

874
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,079
vulnerabilities in any department in

875
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,760
exactly the same way

876
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,520
so we started tracking and emailing on

877
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,720
those too

878
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,520
hey

879
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,240
give your exec team some credit

880
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,320
take time to break down the problem and

881
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,000
the impact in a way that's transparent

882
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,599
for them

883
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,079
make it easy for them to ask clarifying

884
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,960
questions and to make decisions remember

885
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,200
they are experienced and successful

886
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,079
decision makers they make big decisions

887
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,480
all the time and you have a great chance

888
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,640
of getting what you need if you explain

889
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,040
security risk to them in real world

890
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,359
terms break it down for them that's your

891
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,839
job

892
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
now we're going to start broadening our

893
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,320
security point of view from just our

894
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,560
teams and ourselves and our feelings

895
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,960
to expand our point of view to people

896
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,800
and situations in other companies just

897
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,119
sort of venturing out a little bit

898
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,280
we aren't alone in security and we

899
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,320
shouldn't act like we are

900
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,960
even though it feels like it incidents

901
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,680
are not your nightmares they are just a

902
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,839
long series of challenging tasks and

903
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,720
sometimes very very unpleasant ones that

904
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,800
we get paid to and we must execute well

905
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,880
always move yourself back to your mental

906
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,800
and emotional center and once you're

907
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,359
there help others get there

908
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,599
people are more effective when they're i

909
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,119
know i'm it's not the right word but

910
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,119
when they're zen people are better at

911
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,960
their job

912
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,960
your security friends at other companies

913
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,119
don't need your twitter trash talk or

914
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,960
frequent work interruptions hey man

915
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,760
what's up i saw i heard some news

916
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,839
for you to spill the tea

917
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,079
during that big incident they need your

918
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,000
empathy instead

919
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,599
they might even reach out to you for

920
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,400
help

921
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,640
asking in a generic kind of way that's

922
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,560
not going to get anyone in trouble

923
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,040
help them and don't push them don't put

924
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,040
them in a situation where they have to

925
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,119
lie to you

926
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,040
you know what was a broad a bright spot

927
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,040
for us it's kind of odd

928
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,960
during our last incident well our

929
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,800
security friends at another small

930
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,640
company in the bay area

931
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,520
um

932
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,520
heard about what was going on

933
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,079
and they sent us a very special

934
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,800
set of incident cupcakes

935
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,960
and this mattered to us because

936
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,440
a they weren't trying to siphon any

937
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,240
juicy details from us and exploit us and

938
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,119
b

939
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,280
they probably knew that we hadn't eaten

940
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,079
or slept in a while and we definitely

941
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,680
hadn't treated ourselves with something

942
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,079
as tasty as cupcakes

943
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,839
this happens you know that these

944
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,440
security folks are friends forever

945
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,599
and security community

946
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,000
how many of us want to talk more openly

947
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,160
about security incidents

948
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,119
how they came into being how we moved

949
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,160
through them

950
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,560
the impact or toll that it took

951
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,400
so we can learn from one another and

952
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,240
improve faster that's our goal we're

953
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,320
trying to get better

954
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,160
the group discussion feels better when

955
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,640
there are chatham house rules governing

956
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,760
it

957
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,440
why would you do this

958
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,680
this is about sharing wisdom and painful

959
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,599
learnings with the goal of all of us

960
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,880
improving

961
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,040
we all work in security at places where

962
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,119
we have someone else's data or critical

963
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,599
services it's our job to protect that

964
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,320
educating one another across companies

965
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
is a way we can spread learnings across

966
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,880
the world and improve security posture

967
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,440
everywhere

968
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,359
so when the security incident isn't

969
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,160
public knowledge the guideline here is

970
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,480
don't attribute details to people

971
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,560
don't attribute details to companies and

972
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,160
don't attribute details to unique

973
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,480
situations we are here to learn and

974
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,839
protect ourselves from the same

975
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,279
situation from happening to us

976
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,599
similar to the legal and regulatory

977
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,359
community which i'm not a part of but

978
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,520
security people are adjacent to

979
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,240
these are the folks who

980
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,800
dictate terms and contracts they

981
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,040
influence laws

982
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,319
you know

983
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,480
our partners sometimes

984
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,960
how many of you can honestly say that

985
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,040
you feel okay with us security

986
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,880
practitioners talking about incidents

987
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,720
and learnings in an open way with one

988
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,240
another

989
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,000
we know you get nervous about a lot of

990
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,560
stuff not being a security practitioner

991
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,720
and you prefer to say no to us you

992
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,640
prefer that we don't go up on stage you

993
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,280
prefer that we don't dive into details

994
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,119
even if the point of it is learning from

995
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,119
incidents and practicing better security

996
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,520
for our collective customers

997
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,440
can you change some things in your daily

998
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,280
practice and in your own community to

999
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,280
make it easier on us to provide great

1000
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,079
security can you

1001
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,560
use less problematic contract wording in

1002
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,800
terms can you standardize reasonable and

1003
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
situationally intelligent contact terms

1004
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,079
across the board

1005
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,880
can you rethink your checkbox behavior

1006
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,880
and overly punitive actions which

1007
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,480
disincentivize the right kind of

1008
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,240
security action

1009
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,000
is it possible for you to think about

1010
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,680
spirit of the law

1011
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,680
and help us move toward a more blameless

1012
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,720
culture overall instead of where we are

1013
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,400
just putting this out there if you

1014
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,319
really cared about your customer

1015
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,520
security

1016
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,000
instead of asserting paper power over

1017
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,119
everyone

1018
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,880
you would work with us to achieve this

1019
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,000
goal of openness safety effectiveness

1020
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,280
and we would evolve faster

1021
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,800
and finally security people

1022
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,960
in case you aren't supported during

1023
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,599
after and way after an incident just at

1024
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,240
any time remember good security people

1025
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,880
have lots of other options and a big

1026
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,720
community to help line up those options

1027
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,839
for us

1028
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,240
every good security person deserves to

1029
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,720
work in a place where they are believed

1030
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,880
their work is respected and security

1031
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,160
overall is empowered to do its job

1032
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,920
if that's not happening

1033
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,000
it's just like you know exactly what i'm

1034
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,400
about to say

1035
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
an option to work at a better company is

1036
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,160
a great option

1037
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,920
if you're ready to jump make sure that

1038
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,319
jump is to a place that has a heavy

1039
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,000
investment in security they have a

1040
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,480
reputation for it people will vouch for

1041
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,520
them

1042
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,200
and that company listens to what

1043
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,599
security people have to say particularly

1044
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,359
when it pertains to preventing or

1045
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,280
limiting the negative effects of large

1046
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,760
incidents

1047
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,400
word gets around about companies who

1048
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,880
treat their security people well

1049
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,240
we have friends and all of these

1050
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,920
companies and our friends are just as

1051
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,440
aware as we are

1052
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,839
that good security people always have

1053
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,319
options

1054
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,680
so we are all where

1055
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,640
we are

1056
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,800
we're here because our companies listen

1057
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,960
to us and invest in our plans to make

1058
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,520
company the company more secure

1059
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,839
bookmark and keep checking your favorite

1060
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,160
company's job pages because new security

1061
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,079
rules open throughout the year you don't

1062
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,880
know maybe there's one listed and in two

1063
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,640
weeks there will be six listed so just

1064
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,359
keep checking back but again narrow your

1065
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,800
job search to the companies that

1066
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,640
actually take this seriously don't waste

1067
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,319
your time with companies that aren't

1068
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,440
going to let you do your job

1069
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,480
well if you're not ready to leave just

1070
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,079
yet

1071
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,920
maybe you're just kind of mad at your

1072
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,440
employer maybe you're just kind of mad

1073
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,200
at some of your employees that's fine

1074
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,040
you can join the infosec community on

1075
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,640
twitter you can check out the different

1076
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,640
lists i belong to a few of them just

1077
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,920
because i've been on twitter for a long

1078
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,800
time

1079
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,040
you will find plenty of security people

1080
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,400
who will give you advice and

1081
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,480
encouragement when you need it we are

1082
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,680
all doing a variation of the same job

1083
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,280
and we may be able to give you better

1084
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,960
and more specific advice than your

1085
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,440
non-security friends as you know we

1086
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,920
appear to be a personality type

1087
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,560
or if social media plus 2020 for you is

1088
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,880
a big cup of no thank you

1089
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,560
there are still online meetups for

1090
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,920
security practitioners where you can

1091
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,680
always connect with like-minded people

1092
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,520
and learn from them

1093
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,839
