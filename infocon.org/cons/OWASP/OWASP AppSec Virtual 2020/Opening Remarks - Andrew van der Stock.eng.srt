[Music]

7
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,960

[Music]

13
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,959
i'm sorry i'm not perfect but i knew

14
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,130
that i wouldn't be

[Music]

16
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,519

27
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,920

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,520
we've ever held so please bear with us

41
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,800
hopefully you've actually had a chance

42
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,479
to look at all of the different sessions

43
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,919
that we've had

44
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,520
and enjoyed some of the training that

45
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,880
we've been putting on as well

46
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
okay my name is andrew vanderstock i'm

47
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,199
the new executive director however i

48
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,360
have been around owasp for a very long

49
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,639
time

50
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,440
i actually joined ios at the end of 2001

51
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,039
i wasn't here at the very beginning but

52
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,120
i knew who was

53
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,280
i was on the global board between 2015

54
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,080
and 2018 and i've become the executive

55
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,919
director as the as of the end of june

56
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,360
this year

57
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,000
i used to lead the os developer guide

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,919
and indeed if you want to help them

59
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,600
they're

60
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,199
they would like some help

61
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,600
i am the current co-lead of the os top

62
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,240
10 along with three other folks and i'm

63
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,479
also the co-lead of the os application

64
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,160
security verification standard which is

65
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,479
the actual standard you should use

66
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,520
um

67
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,680
my favorite pastimes are being with my

68
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,600
family playing elite dangerous and

69
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,400
annoying my cat

70
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
oas has grown even in this difficult

71
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,199
year we now have over 280 chapters we

72
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,280
have over 60 corporate members we have

73
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,479
over 3 200 active members

74
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,120
we have over 65 000 people actually talk

75
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,680
to us on a regular basis um in terms of

76
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,759
people who can come to our meetings

77
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,880
in meetup

78
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,000
and we have over 190 active source open

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,160
source projects on github

80
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,759
it only costs 50 bucks a year to be a

81
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,759
member of owas and i would highly

82
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,360
recommend it i'm actually a lifetime

83
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,120
member and

84
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,400
without a doubt it's one of the best

85
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,440
things i've ever done for my career

86
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,759
so

87
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,440
if you it's not too late you can still

88
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,360
register to view all of the 60 plus

89
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,199
on-demand sessions you can actually

90
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,680
watch them at any point um you don't

91
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,199
actually have to wait for

92
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,120
a particular time like we would in a

93
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,840
real physical conference

94
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,680
please do visit the expo hall our

95
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,080
sponsors have swag prizes

96
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,639
um they are looking to have chats with

97
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,000
you if you want

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,800
but fundamentally it's the equivalent of

99
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,520
like the little tables that are in the

100
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,000
expo halls in our normal one we also

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,560
have a career fair this coming friday i

102
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,000
would strongly recommend if you're in

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,400
the market for a new position and do pop

104
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,560
in there's at least eight companies who

105
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,720
are trying to recruit and i'm you know

106
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,400
this is an industry that has almost zero

107
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,240
percent unemployment so i'm sure you'll

108
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,520
find something interesting there

109
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,919
so where are we going so this is the big

110
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,000
thing on everyone's mind how is os going

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
to get going

112
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,759
and get back to normal

113
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,720
obviously 2020 has had a difficult start

114
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
um we're all looking forward to the end

115
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,560
of covid we're all looking forward to

116
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
being able to be in person again

117
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,319
and so for us we need to get back to our

118
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,680
knitting

119
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,000
if we just simply chose to become small

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,319
i was like literally just

121
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,319
don't do a thing for a year or two i

122
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,199
think we would have missed the

123
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,440
opportunity for some key reform

124
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,199
and in fact before i joined there was a

125
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,520
lot of community descent with things

126
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,599
that weren't quite going well

127
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,520
and so what we've done is to try to turn

128
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,639
this around

129
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,400
and because we are trying to do a

130
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,840
survive and then a thrive

131
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,560
and then refocus on mission

132
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,720
what we're trying to do is get to a

133
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,840
place where we can actually say at the

134
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,240
end of covid once we're back on our feet

135
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
we'll be a much stronger more diverse

136
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,240
organization

137
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,559
for a start it's very unlikely that the

138
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,320
us will be the or the place in which

139
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,720
os re-emerges if you like

140
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,320
just simply because of the way that

141
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,640
covert has been handled here in many

142
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,560
cases people won't be able to travel to

143
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,080
the us and many cases the u.s

144
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,760
u.s people will not be able to travel to

145
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,080
other countries for a while so even if

146
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
other countries are reopening we won't

147
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,440
be able to go there so we need to

148
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,880
actually make sure that we're truly a

149
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,959
global organization so we need to really

150
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,040
focus on this mission

151
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,279
our mission is to help developers build

152
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,279
secure applications

153
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,240
this coming january at the actual board

154
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,640
face-to-face which i'm planning

155
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,200
i want them to re-imagine owass as a

156
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,120
devsecops organization so that

157
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,399
everything we do

158
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,160
is available to developers in a

159
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,080
developer-first and developer-centric

160
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,279
way

161
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,360
to do that we can't do this as a

162
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,680
foundation my staff are here to enable

163
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,600
the mission they are not here to

164
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
actually do the mission

165
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,279
and that is a cut that is a fundamental

166
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,720
change to where we are where at the

167
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,800
beginning of this year

168
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,120
so not only do we need to survive

169
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,600
and actually make it through covet we

170
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,839
need to refocus on mission and through

171
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,760
that we can thrive

172
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,439
so how do we do these things

173
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,519
we do it through community reform

174
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,440
the way that i phrase this when we've

175
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
been doing the reform is

176
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,160
by the community for the community we

177
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,920
want to make sure that the community is

178
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,079
the people in charge and running the

179
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,880
actual things that they want to do

180
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
and they do that through understanding

181
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
what our mission is through the board's

182
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,920
strategy and then they have committees

183
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,560
the committees themselves are the way

184
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,680
that we work

185
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,640
but the community is made up of you

186
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,880
you and our members and the developers

187
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,240
and the community

188
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,600
at large um organizations governments

189
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,760
those sorts of folks who need

190
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,480
ows to be a sound and strong

191
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,200
organization

192
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,519
very many organizations rely upon things

193
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,480
like the os top 10 the testing guide the

194
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,839
mobile testing guide osap and many other

195
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,320
types of projects that we put on

196
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,959
without these we don't have the brand

197
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,800
recognition

198
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,560
of a world leader in application

199
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,279
security and we are a world leader in

200
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,880
application security and we do that

201
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,040
through community

202
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,360
the community elects the global board

203
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,200
we're in the middle of an election if

204
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
you haven't yet voted i would strongly

205
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,959
recommend you do so

206
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,920
they are your representatives

207
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
check to make sure that they have the

208
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,000
same vision that you do for os and

209
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,160
please elect the board that you want to

210
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,959
see

211
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,880
there are three positions up this year

212
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,720
and i would strongly recommend you look

213
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
through the bios look through the videos

214
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,800
and the answers that they've given and

215
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
make sure that they reflect your values

216
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,279
and then vote for them

217
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,839
lastly we've got essentially committees

218
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,560
we've been busy setting them up and

219
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,519
those committees are

220
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,959
we're probably going to have a members

221
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,640
committee it might be the chapters and

222
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,920
members committee

223
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,200
but the chapters committee has been

224
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,920
reformed in terms of

225
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,600
um helping

226
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,480
re-establish chapters regional chapters

227
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
student chapters and actually doing

228
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,000
things such as making sure that the

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,240
chapter policy is sound making sure the

230
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
chapter handbook is updated

231
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,040
we also got some massive finance reform

232
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
which we'll talk about soon that will

233
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,560
fundamentally change the way that

234
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,880
chapters work globally at the moment

235
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,519
only around 50 50 odd chapters can spend

236
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,399
money

237
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,079
our goal of the finance reform is to

238
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,079
allow all chapters regardless of what

239
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,760
they believe they have to be able to

240
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,360
spend

241
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,320
we have

242
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,000
we formed a project

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,120
committee this committee is designed to

244
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,800
promote the

245
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,240
building creation and good life cycle of

246
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,279
projects ows is famous for its projects

247
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,839
if you actually type in oh what and

248
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,360
whatever it might be

249
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,760
in all likelihood you'll see the os top

250
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,120
10 and the oauth cheat sheet series

251
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,959
those two projects in themselves

252
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,440
dominate the first two or three pages of

253
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,600
results for hours and this shows you

254
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,839
that we are used extremely heavily in

255
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,480
the community

256
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,839
outreach we want to reach developers we

257
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,639
cannot do this by staying in our own

258
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,800
little bubble we all agree with each

259
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,160
other that application security is

260
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,920
incredibly important but we need to

261
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,480
reach new people new students new people

262
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,120
who are coding but don't yet know about

263
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,600
application security or privacy

264
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,440
we need to catch these folks and we do

265
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,600
that through the outreach committee

266
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,120
recently we had the wiia committee

267
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,200
rename itself to the weir diversity and

268
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,560
inclusion committee

269
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,480
they will be helping us with everyone

270
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,360
from early stage careers

271
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
those who are actually

272
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,440
obviously women in application security

273
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
and also making sure that underserved

274
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,639
communities such as those in african

275
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,240
india

276
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,079
you know latin america and other places

277
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,480
that are completely underserved

278
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,240
an example of this is that many years

279
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,880
ago i did some work for a vietnamese

280
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,120
company and they didn't have any

281
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,839
resources at all in their local language

282
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,360
to understand how the application

283
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,440
security worked this is the function of

284
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,079
the we diversity inclusion helping

285
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,720
people who currently are locked out of

286
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,519
our industry to become included we will

287
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,160
be much stronger for it and

288
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,320
well realistically without the next

289
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,959
generation of folks coming aboard

290
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,959
we we're not going to have a long-term

291
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,079
profession

292
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,320
we need diversity more than almost every

293
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,480
other one of these things it's central

294
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,360
to our mission

295
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,920
we are reforming events events used to

296
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,480
be tied to chapters soon events will be

297
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,800
their own thing events are literally

298
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,120
going to become

299
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,760
any one of any of these types of things

300
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,240
like members projects chapters outreach

301
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,760
diversity

302
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,399
education they can all then run events

303
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,320
this means that there's only one type of

304
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,199
event

305
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,720
and that is going to be called apsec

306
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,639
days this will make it a lot simpler for

307
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,279
people to run appsec days local events

308
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,440
and obviously our global

309
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,600
events the strategy for this is to make

310
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
it so simple to run an event that

311
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
everyone should be able to do so so

312
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,839
instead of having 20 to 30 regional

313
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,519
events a year we could easily have

314
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,279
hundreds and that's where we need to

315
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,320
scale to

316
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,000
and that's why we're establishing an

317
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
events committee and to help you run

318
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
your own local events

319
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,079
the education committee was formed

320
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,600
recently and they are working on a

321
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,480
tertiary and an industry syllabus the

322
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
tertiary syllabus will be available as

323
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,440
more or less a curriculum which is more

324
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
or less like an academic framework for

325
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
what should be taught

326
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
the industry curriculum will be more

327
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,120
along the lines of the sorts of things

328
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,720
that you might see

329
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,560
out there being advertised as being

330
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,800
secure coding or similar types of

331
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,120
training we want to make sure that when

332
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,320
people teach os materials that they have

333
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,160
the right information and that's why we

334
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,560
have the education committee helping us

335
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,079
i also want to charge them with helping

336
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,759
high school students get into our

337
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,079
industry and get prepared to do software

338
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,800
engineering courses with a security bend

339
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,519
without that pipeline we're not going to

340
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,959
have the next generation in our

341
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,560
profession and we need to make sure that

342
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,519
pipeline is fully primed

343
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,519
lastly we are in the process of

344
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,199
establishing a corporate advisory

345
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,279
committee this committee will

346
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,079
help

347
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,040
uh our corporate members and sponsors

348
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,079
advise the board on the best way to

349
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,360
work with industry for both sponsorship

350
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,160
fundraising but also what policies or

351
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,600
by-laws or what um types of sponsorship

352
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,839
they would like to see at the moment

353
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,480
we'd ask them through town halls

354
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,959
and through direct you know interactions

355
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,800
what they would like but i think we're

356
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,480
missing an opportunity here to learn

357
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,240
more about how we can better integrate

358
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,720
with the uh the corporate industry

359
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,279
to do this we need to have some

360
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,399
anti-competitive um protections

361
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,720
we will get that done soon

362
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,360
it is coming

363
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,040
so

364
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,720
the other parts of the reforms are

365
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,800
fundraising donations awards

366
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,279
scholarships expenses grants events and

367
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,839
travel as you can see this is the

368
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,000
biggest reform in ios history and if we

369
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,520
get it all done by the end of next year

370
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,919
i'll be extraordinarily happy

371
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,199
we're going to talk about some of these

372
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,720
in more detail in the next couple of

373
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,720
slides

374
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,480
so finance reform when we first got

375
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,760
going owasp was run on a oily rank

376
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,919
literally no money whatsoever for the

377
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,079
first three or four years until the

378
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,960
foundation was established in 2004

379
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,480
whatever funds were coming in were

380
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
basically being funded by the leaders

381
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,440
themselves and that was it but when we

382
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,280
started to run events such as appsec

383
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,520
eu's and whatnot we needed to have a

384
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
foundation and so that was set up by

385
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
jeff williams and dave wickers back in

386
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,840
2004

387
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,080
back then we had a very simple finance

388
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,160
mechanism and over time it has grown and

389
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,960
got crusty and unfortunately it's got to

390
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,200
the point now that

391
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,120
certain chapters

392
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,880
have more money than the foundation

393
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,240
actually has

394
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,080
and the reason why this has occurred is

395
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,240
that unfortunately they were able to get

396
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
a large percentage of all of the income

397
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,600
of the foundation

398
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,640
but very little way to actually spend it

399
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,160
and what's happened in the meantime is

400
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,320
that many chapters have found themselves

401
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,640
locked out of any sort of activity

402
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,799
because they don't have access to funds

403
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,160
now of course the board can give anybody

404
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,200
funds

405
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,960
but we want to do this in a much more

406
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,640
sustainable way

407
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,520
if the irs or the eu tax authorities

408
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,960
come to us they have a thing called

409
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,120
compliance and part of that compliance

410
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,640
is to demonstrate that we are spending

411
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,120
money on outcomes we're not just without

412
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,200
spending money we need to demonstrate

413
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,679
that for the 80-something percent that

414
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,080
is spent on program what did we get out

415
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,440
of it

416
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,120
at the moment we don't have a very good

417
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,200
straight um story to tell them

418
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,039
only that we're spending money

419
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,960
and that is not good enough and so what

420
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,200
we're going to be doing is we will be

421
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,679
reforming finances and it'll be the

422
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,000
substantial reform that will last at

423
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,720
least five and preferably the next 20

424
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,520
years

425
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,240
we're going to be coming into a standard

426
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,080
non-profit model each of the areas will

427
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,160
end up with their own

428
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,760
part of the mission

429
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,600
they will be responsible for some of the

430
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,120
funding for that and they'll be

431
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,880
responsible for some of the spending for

432
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,520
them and so what this means is balances

433
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,799
as we know them for chapters and

434
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,559
projects will go away

435
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,080
it means that committees for the first

436
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,679
time will actually have a budget they

437
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,919
can spend but they need to spend it on

438
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,280
mission

439
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,160
now

440
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,960
we can only spend money if we fundraise

441
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,640
and this is another aspect of the owl's

442
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,080
foundation that we haven't done in the

443
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,960
past we've done most of our income

444
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,200
through events and that has worked in

445
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,600
the good times unfortunately as covert

446
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,679
has demonstrated this does not work in

447
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,360
the bad times

448
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
we need to diversify our funds not only

449
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,080
geographically but also across all the

450
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,559
different types of mission that we do

451
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,880
to rely and fund all of the other

452
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,280
activities off the back of two or three

453
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,720
global events

454
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,600
isn't sustainable for us to grow and

455
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,679
when was once coveted is over and

456
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,520
everyone's back to normal we need to be

457
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,200
in a much stronger position to earn

458
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,600
funds in many different ways and in the

459
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
meantime those many different ways will

460
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,919
help owels survive we're not looking for

461
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,760
a windfall here we're looking for a way

462
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,240
forward that diversifies our income from

463
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,679
over 85 from income sources to where

464
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,400
events are probably no more than 30 to

465
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
35 percent of our income

466
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,159
and the only way for us to do that is

467
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,480
massive reform of finance

468
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,400
so the way that this will work

469
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,640
is we are going to end balances i have

470
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
been discussing this with the large

471
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,080
regional events and we've got general

472
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,559
agreement i now need to have town halls

473
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,080
with the chapters because they are the

474
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,679
most affected because they have the most

475
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,640
funds

476
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,880
however this does not mean that chapters

477
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,039
will lose access to funding

478
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,280
actually to the contrary it'll be a lot

479
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,520
simpler the expenses policy going

480
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,320
forward will be if two leaders approve

481
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,799
an expense and you have a receipt

482
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,240
it's approved

483
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,200
there's no

484
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,640
there's not going to be any discussion

485
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,960
about what is and is not a reasonable

486
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,640
expense because i'm expecting you to be

487
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,919
responsible

488
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,320
if the irs comes calling and says what

489
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
was this expense i'm going to redirect

490
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,880
them towards you

491
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,360
we don't necessarily need to complicate

492
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,960
this overly much

493
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,799
i want to make it easier for every

494
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,360
chapter all over the world to hold

495
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,080
events local events regional events and

496
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,679
the only way for that to happen is for

497
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,880
chapters to become chapters not chapters

498
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,799
with events

499
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,720
because what was happening was we were

500
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,600
putting

501
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,840
you know restrictions on projects that

502
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,600
weren't there for chapters and we were

503
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,520
putting restrictions on chapters that

504
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,760
were restricting activities

505
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,039
for example

506
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,440
a um a san diego chapter leader wanted

507
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,559
to do a podcast using av level broadcast

508
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,520
equipment

509
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,559
and that is fantastic i love the idea of

510
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,640
podcasting i love the idea of getting

511
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,320
together like with the joe rogan type

512
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,400
show that is exactly the sort of thing

513
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,240
that os should be spending its money on

514
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,120
but it's not a chapter expense and so

515
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,520
we basically could not approve it under

516
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,919
the current funding mechanism yet we

517
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,840
want to do that we should be telling

518
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,679
ourselves what we should be able to do

519
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,159
not what we can't do and so the finance

520
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,880
reform will turn this around

521
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,960
so how will it work

522
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,520
the board will allocate to each of the

523
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,600
committees a certain amount of money to

524
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,280
spend throughout the year

525
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,760
they will use that funding through

526
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,760
budget requests they will submit budgets

527
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,440
before the end of the year

528
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,280
and they will then spend that throughout

529
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,520
the year on the things they want to do

530
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,360
additionally individual projects and

531
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,039
individual chapters

532
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,360
will be able to do whatever they

533
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,919
want within the expenses policy the

534
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,440
expenses policy during covert is

535
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,280
extraordinarily simple if it's less than

536
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,679
250 dollars and two of you agree and you

537
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,960
have a receipt it's good to go however i

538
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,640
want you to do it on the things that

539
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,799
you're actually doing you cannot spend

540
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,320
chapter funds on non-chapter expenses

541
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,000
you can't spend project funds on

542
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
non-project things because we have a

543
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,600
different way of doing it now

544
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,159
soon there will be a thing called grants

545
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,000
we will have a bunch of new things

546
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,679
we're going to go through and create

547
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,720
grants awards scholarships travel and a

548
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,320
whole bunch of other things to make

549
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,280
things

550
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,039
possible

551
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,360
this will actually allow everyone from

552
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,240
chapters to fund activities for events

553
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
which will be their own profit and loss

554
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,880
mechanisms they can spend their profits

555
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
on funding the mission

556
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,159
for example

557
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,360
a um an event such as absent cali may

558
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,279
wish to fund

559
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,200
activities within its local chapter

560
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,360
sphere of influence just as they do

561
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,320
today

562
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
that's not going to be stopped what will

563
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,080
be done is instead is that they will

564
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,400
have to put up grants and ask for things

565
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,960
so for example that camera the av thing

566
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,039
abset kelly could absolutely

567
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,039
fund that particular request

568
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,919
if they chose to do so

569
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,679
so could the outreach committee and

570
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,279
that's what i'm trying to get at we need

571
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,200
to be able to say to various people

572
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,880
within our organization yes you can not

573
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,159
no

574
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,840
so we're going to be doing a lot of

575
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,440
different things over the next couple of

576
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,120
months and

577
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,919
you

578
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,760
are very welcome to provide your

579
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,960
feedback

580
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,240
on slack through email through the

581
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,960
leaders list and through the town halls

582
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,679
please do participate because without

583
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:40,559
people

584
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,400
ascending to these changes it won't work

585
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,720
what cannot stay is the current

586
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,279
situation where balances are holding

587
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,279
back the vast majority of our mission

588
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,799
and particularly during covet we are

589
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,279
spending so little money because so few

590
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,679
people are allowed to spend money and

591
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,640
that's not okay we need to fix this yes

592
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,159
next year we won't have a large

593
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,279
allocation of funds but the reality is

594
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,039
once we get back to the good years we'll

595
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,559
be able to fund a lot more than we do

596
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,039
today because we have the ability to

597
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,000
have money moving

598
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,760
we will be asking for people to do

599
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,400
fundraising and donations we will be

600
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,760
asking for

601
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,159
uh for os to be remembered in your wills

602
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,919
if you wish to do so

603
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,640
um we will be funding sponsorships

604
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,760
scholarships awards and things like that

605
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,200
so if you want to actually set up a

606
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,279
piece of work as a project leader say

607
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,240
for example the zap project which is to

608
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,520
um

609
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,760
get every single asvs

610
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,520
test at level one to be a github action

611
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,799
and that would cost say 150 000

612
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,360
we can set up a grant to let that happen

613
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,279
and then we can go out and fundraise and

614
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,720
get that happening and then we can get

615
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,240
people who are actually building their

616
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,640
zap project to build that functionality

617
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,159
and that's what we're trying to get is

618
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,600
actually more mission activity not less

619
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,840
we're also going to go towards monthly

620
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,240
memberships at the moment it is actually

621
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,919
very difficult for some people to

622
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,640
justify a fifty dollar expense in the

623
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,120
time of covet whereas a six dollar a

624
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,919
month expense is definitely doable so

625
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:16,960
what we're going to be doing is we're

626
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,840
going to be setting up monthly

627
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,559
memberships and including four regional

628
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,400
memberships so

629
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,320
for the first time we'll have regional

630
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,600
membership pricing for not only students

631
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
but for individual members but also

632
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,240
lifetime members

633
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,080
recently the board approved

634
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,320
complementary leadership and so what

635
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,600
this will mean is if you're an active

636
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,039
leader you will get complementary

637
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,799
membership for a year

638
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,480
you don't have to take that up but it's

639
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,159
actually coming so there's a lot of

640
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,320
reforms coming that'll actually make os

641
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,000
a lot better from the community's point

642
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
of view

643
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,240
the only downside for some is that there

644
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
will be accountability and there will be

645
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,720
transparency we must be able to

646
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,480
demonstrate to the tax authorities that

647
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,080
we are spending on mission and we are

648
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,559
doing it so in such a way that is

649
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,919
responsible

650
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,200
and has deliberate outcomes if we fund

651
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,120
something for fifty thousand dollars or

652
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,200
ten thousand dollars or two hundred and

653
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,960
fifty dollars there is an outcome

654
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,240
attached to it we're not just giving

655
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,600
money away

656
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,880
and that transparency is a core value of

657
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,000
owers we've always had this transparency

658
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,159
and sometimes it causes us difficulties

659
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,919
but the reality is we're not going to go

660
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,760
away from being transparent

661
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,399
if you have an expense expect it to be

662
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,640
visible to the community if they choose

663
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,840
to go look this is why i think the new

664
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,080
expense policy will work not because

665
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,080
people might abuse it but because people

666
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,240
know that they could be reviewed by

667
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,440
their peers

668
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
and people can ask questions was that

669
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,880
really a good idea and spending that

670
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,480
money

671
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,880
but it will also allow our donors to

672
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,799
actually view the sorts of things that

673
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,480
we're spending our money on

674
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,799
and so if someone a charity navigator

675
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,880
comes to us and says well show us your

676
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,640
program spending i can actually then

677
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,399
open the books and deliberately show

678
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,399
them and we don't need to do that in the

679
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,159
form of restricted donations we can do

680
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,080
that deliberately in unrestricted

681
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,159
donations which gets more money for the

682
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,200
mission if we do restricted donations

683
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
there's a lot of overhead for that and

684
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,279
in fact if you give us a restricted

685
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,120
donation for a thousand dollars the

686
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,600
project or chapter or grant or whatever

687
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,200
will only get eight hundred dollars of

688
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,000
that

689
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,360
and that's simply because of the

690
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,760
overheads and we as a foundation

691
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,360
wouldn't even make money on that we

692
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,679
would actually lose some of that money

693
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,320
restricted donations are incredibly

694
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,520
awful

695
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,600
and we have to spend them within the

696
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,760
year that we receive them and so there's

697
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,840
a multi-year effort for example writing

698
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,760
the next version of the developer guide

699
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,520
and someone gives us a restricted

700
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,720
donation the reality is it goes away at

701
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,559
the end of the year and then all of a

702
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,640
sudden the project has no more money

703
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,880
that isn't what we want we want to have

704
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,960
a situation where unrestricted gifts

705
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,840
helps everybody and not just one project

706
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,840
but we have transparency for our donors

707
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,159
so event reform is going to be

708
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,399
absolutely critical we have so many

709
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,840
different types of events at the moment

710
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,240
we have over seven different types we're

711
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,159
going to collapse that to local events

712
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,000
which are essentially always going to be

713
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,039
free

714
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,559
as a chapter as a project as a committee

715
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,919
you are welcome to run a local event and

716
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,559
as long as the event is free you will

717
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,440
have access to the expenses policy and

718
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,080
you can access our virtual

719
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
activities such as

720
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,760
having access to zoom

721
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,320
we have a 1 000 seat zoom room with

722
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,720
webinar facilities so you can host even

723
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,080
the largest of events through our stuff

724
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,480
for free

725
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,960
we're going to have a rebranding

726
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,760
campaign for all other regional events

727
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,440
because we have so many different forms

728
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,720
of them at the moment what we're going

729
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,480
to be doing is calling mapsec days no

730
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,600
matter if they're a single day or

731
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,000
multiple days and what this will mean is

732
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,159
there will be one event type and anybody

733
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,679
projects chapters events

734
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,799
committees

735
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,760
anyone can run a regional event

736
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,440
and what this will mean is that the same

737
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,600
set of rules will apply to all

738
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,679
and it will be a lot simpler there will

739
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,919
be a budget for the virtual a budget for

740
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,760
small to medium events and budget for

741
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,960
large events and if you're not a

742
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,520
large event your budget time the time to

743
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,120
actually turn up a um and create a

744
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,360
budget that works that is profitable

745
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,159
which is a key element for us

746
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,399
will take you probably 10 to 15 minutes

747
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,840
whereas at the moment it can take a long

748
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,480
time it can take a long time to plan an

749
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
event and we don't want to be in having

750
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,679
such an amazing amount of overhead

751
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,200
we're also going to be reforming the way

752
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,720
that the foundation works here there

753
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,720
used to be splits of

754
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,799
90 9010 what will happen is that these

755
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,880
events will get 100 of the proceeds but

756
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,399
the actual things the foundation

757
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,399
provides for you will be provided to you

758
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,519
for a fee

759
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,600
for example you will need insurance to

760
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,159
run a in-person event particularly if

761
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,120
you're serving alcohol we have to do

762
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
this for whatever reason but we can do

763
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,720
it very cheaply in fact we generally

764
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,320
don't get charged additional funds for

765
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,640
that but there will be a rate card

766
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,960
available for the event for the services

767
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
that we provide regional events you

768
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,279
don't have to use us for most of them

769
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,399
but if you do want things like

770
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,480
merchandise or swag or you want to have

771
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,360
for us to do promotions for you

772
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,279
or get your sponsors they will be

773
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,679
available for a reasonable fee and that

774
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,279
way that the actual events will be their

775
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,360
own profit and loss the only restriction

776
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,960
we'll have is that you need to make a

777
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,600
small profit it can be one dollar but as

778
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,240
long as it's one dollar we're okay

779
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,919
events that lose money will not get

780
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,840
approved so we just need to make sure

781
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,320
that people are aware of this

782
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,000
generally events make money hand over

783
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,919
fist and we expect folks to actually set

784
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,840
these things up for the benefit of the

785
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,000
foundation to do more mission that

786
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,120
doesn't mean

787
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,039
for the foundation to get 30 or 40

788
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,039
employees far from it what we're really

789
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,480
looking forward

790
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,640
is for more mission activities instead

791
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,880
of 20 or 30 regional events a year i

792
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,679
want a hundred i want 200 i'd love to be

793
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,200
in a position where we can actually hire

794
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,760
more people to help with regional events

795
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,080
but we can't do that without reforming

796
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,159
events

797
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,840
we do want to have more abstract days

798
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,519
globally and that means in different

799
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,679
regions and we are trying to get one up

800
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,480
in

801
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,320
the asia pacific region

802
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
we are looking very seriously at running

803
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,799
a global event in australia next year we

804
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,799
are looking very seriously at running a

805
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,600
big event in india next year as well

806
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,200
but in likelihood we are going to be

807
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,120
running virtual events and during this

808
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,000
time

809
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,240
regional events can be virtual and you

810
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,679
just simply need to talk to us about

811
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,840
getting access to zoom and we can get

812
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,159
you going in a no time flat so please if

813
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,679
you do have an idea for a great

814
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,279
event

815
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,279
start putting it together ask us for a

816
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,120
budget and we'll get those to you once

817
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,000
we've done the reform

818
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,440
fundraising donations and sponsorships

819
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,000
are like lifeblood of every non-profit

820
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,840
the fact that owas hasn't done it to

821
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,799
this point is i think a little bit

822
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,679
um we've missed an opportunity

823
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,360
we need to do these things and if you've

824
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,600
got any um

825
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,000
passion for os and you want to help with

826
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,559
fundraising or donations or you can be

827
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,919
in a position to become a corporate

828
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,760
sponsor or an event sponsor please do so

829
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,159
we need to diversify our funding we need

830
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,080
to go out and get grants from

831
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
governments and from organizations to

832
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,600
fund our mission

833
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,200
to do this we're actually going to be

834
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,840
doing a sponsorship deck and we'll be

835
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,679
basically making sure that people who

836
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,360
are traditionally good at giving

837
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,440
restricted grants would be satisfied

838
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,360
with an unrestricted grant

839
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,440
we will still have restricted grants

840
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,360
available for those who must have them

841
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,279
but we will only

842
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,440
be having 25 of them

843
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,200
and generally they will be for a

844
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,120
substantial sum of money because of the

845
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,880
overhead we will not be doing

846
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,640
restrictive donations for small sums of

847
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,200
money because generally the entire

848
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,640
restricted donation under a thousand

849
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,239
dollars will just simply be eaten up in

850
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,960
fees and these are not ios fees these

851
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,679
are

852
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,480
admin tax overhead fees we just can't do

853
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,040
them um so for the mission to be funded

854
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,560
we need for as many of them to be

855
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,800
unrestricted as possible

856
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,280
so do look for fundraising drives

857
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,239
membership drives and all forms of

858
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,320
donorship um like for example with the

859
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,480
wikipedia with them things saying um

860
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,159
please give us money or the npr

861
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,199
you know

862
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,199
donation-a-thon type of deal

863
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,079
we are going to do that in 2021 and

864
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,000
please do

865
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,800
re-share and retweet this information if

866
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,839
you are in a position to become a

867
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,359
corporate sponsor please do so we need

868
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,599
everybody to come and help us over this

869
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,480
next couple of years

870
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,839
as

871
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,640
we move away from

872
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,079
a very simplistic but very difficult

873
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,400
expenses policy where people have to

874
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,680
have money

875
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,079
to do things we are going to be

876
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,880
formalizing how awards are given and how

877
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,720
scholarships are granted

878
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,800
and what this means is if say for

879
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,880
example we want to reinstate the waspy

880
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,960
awards which we do want to do

881
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,000
we will be

882
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,839
under this same policy and what this

883
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,320
will do is it allows anyone a committee

884
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,760
a project an event to award a prize or

885
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,640
some sort of reward under

886
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,960
known circumstances

887
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,359
to a set of people

888
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,200
and what this will mean is that we will

889
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,960
have transparency in awards for the

890
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,079
first time

891
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,320
what are the selection criteria how was

892
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
it decided what sort of funding was

893
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,000
required

894
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,240
same with scholarships we will be moving

895
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,000
away from a complimentary leadership

896
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,040
model

897
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,000
where

898
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,480
leaders were automatically eligible for

899
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,359
a large number of free things but our

900
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,440
lifetime members were not what we're

901
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,119
going to be doing is actually using the

902
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,839
scholarships model to provide places for

903
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,079
those who need to have access to these

904
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,400
things who wouldn't have necessarily had

905
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,079
access before

906
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,000
but under a fair and reasonable

907
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,960
mechanism if say for example we have 100

908
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,200
spots available for leaders they will be

909
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,040
available to all leaders regardless of

910
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,640
where they are in the world and you just

911
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,240
have to be one of the first

912
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,560
whereas for example we might have

913
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,040
a scholarship for

914
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,520
someone from say for example an

915
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,599
underdeveloped country to come to a

916
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,680
global app sec and there will be some

917
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,280
travel and obviously some hotel

918
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,880
accommodation and other expenses

919
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,200
attached how do they apply well that'll

920
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,760
be open and it will be well advertised

921
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,280
this is part of that transparency we're

922
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
looking for so that we can actually go

923
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,960
and get it funded there are going to be

924
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,640
plenty of folks out there who would

925
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,240
actually be interested in funding some

926
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,640
of these scholarships

927
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
and lastly grants

928
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,839
this is going to be the fundamental

929
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,359
mechanism for getting our mission done

930
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,960
from here on in

931
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,000
generally

932
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,320
people will come up with packages to be

933
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,599
developed into a deliverable um and we

934
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,920
will be looking for who's going to do it

935
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,320
by when and how much will it cost and

936
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,839
what sort of opportunities could be

937
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,160
there for sponsorship or some sort of

938
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,000
grant mechanism so that we can get

939
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,520
funding for it

940
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,000
for example a chapter may want to

941
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,760
sponsor a grant to give someone in their

942
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,440
chapter

943
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,320
a training spot at the

944
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,839
a global app sec

945
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,040
that's what this is for okay so

946
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,800
the grants will go through the audit

947
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,119
committee to get approved but

948
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,800
fundamentally the community will be

949
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,440
running the grants process this is going

950
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,280
to be really important for us because at

951
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,280
the moment it's very opaque as to how

952
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,599
people get money and although it was

953
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,400
somewhat known that the board would give

954
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,800
grants to people if they had a specific

955
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
thing they wanted to do the reality is

956
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,119
it was so rarely used it wasn't funny we

957
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,119
need to move away from the idea of

958
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,760
expenses funding absolutely everything

959
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,240
to expenses being more like petty cash

960
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,880
and grants as actual outcomes

961
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,960
so do think about ways that you might

962
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,040
want to repackage your work as a series

963
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,320
of grants that we could go and get

964
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,400
funded for you so you can get some work

965
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,599
done

966
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,839
we are finally saying the end of this is

967
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,480
what you're not allowed to do

968
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,599
that vocabulary at ios is dead we are

969
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,520
saying what you can do

970
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,680
in a nice transparent and equitable way

971
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,560
so the call to action become a member

972
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,240
it's fifty dollars a year in many

973
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,400
countries it's twenty dollars a year in

974
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,720
most other countries that aren't fifty

975
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,640
um we will be having monthly membership

976
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,960
soon which will just be a subscription

977
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,400
um we will be providing

978
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,320
subscription-based lifetime memberships

979
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,720
so that after a period of time maybe one

980
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,320
to two years we're not terribly sure yet

981
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,920
we'll work on that and announce it when

982
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,680
it's the appropriate time that you can

983
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,160
become a lifetime member

984
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,040
he's become a sponsor we have so many

985
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,079
benefits we have a community of over 60

986
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,160
000 people who are the direct consumers

987
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,960
of the things that are in our industry

988
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,440
for example static code analysis tools

989
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,640
very few other people have that reach

990
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,880
please do think about becoming a sponsor

991
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,680
we have an amazing community and i

992
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,599
really want

993
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,240
for that community to have benefits so

994
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,359
if you can provide and become a sponsor

995
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,200
we are looking at becoming a creating a

996
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
corporate advisory board but we're also

997
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,280
looking for discounts for our members

998
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,680
for your products so think about ways

999
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,119
that sponsors can work in both

1000
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,119
directions there's a lot of different

1001
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,480
benefits and if you are interested

1002
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,079
please reach out to me or kelly

1003
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,760
centalucha

1004
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,160
you can create or join a project and i

1005
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,599
would strongly recommend this this is

1006
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,000
how i got into obos all those years ago

1007
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,760
by helping out the os developer guide

1008
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
and it's done an amazing thing for my

1009
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,640
career please do join projects if you've

1010
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,320
got an idea for a project have a look

1011
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,599
and make sure there's no other projects

1012
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,040
like yours because maybe you could help

1013
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,680
them but if you haven't found it create

1014
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,880
one

1015
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,960
you can create or join a local chapter

1016
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
at this moment we are only hosting

1017
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,040
virtual events and so if you're a

1018
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,119
chapter leader please hold virtual

1019
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,280
events if there's no local chapter near

1020
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,000
you please create one then within 80

1021
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,839
kilometers of your local

1022
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,960
area about 50 miles on legacy units

1023
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,359
we won't generally create local chapters

1024
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,359
but in the virtual time it doesn't

1025
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,720
really matter where you are and you can

1026
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,880
hold a local chapter and we are looking

1027
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,880
at doing things like theming chapters

1028
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,200
and having regional chapters again

1029
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,119
regional chapters have been abandoned

1030
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,720
for a long time because they're almost

1031
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,920
um

1032
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,000
they don't really work we're working on

1033
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,560
trying to fix that so do hold virtual

1034
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,240
events if you want to hold a virtual

1035
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,720
chapter

1036
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,680
around a theme such as leadership or

1037
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,240
um for example devops or whatever the

1038
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,920
case may be you can become the

1039
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,359
specialist chapter for that and get a

1040
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,880
lot more people coming than just your

1041
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,640
local area do think out of the box for

1042
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,400
those things while we're in this virtual

1043
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,839
world

1044
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,480
do organize appsec days in your area

1045
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,880
again we have virtual options available

1046
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,359
to you we can have up to 12 simultaneous

1047
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,160
streams we have access to

1048
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,000
a lot of different activities and we're

1049
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,240
obviously able to run a large event like

1050
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,640
this with no issues whatsoever do talk

1051
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,079
to us about how you might be able to run

1052
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,960
a local event in your area

1053
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,640
