1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,040
hi everyone thanks for joining uh

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,720
you know thank you very much to uh the

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,040
osp foundation and apsec usa for for

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,280
having me along uh pleasure to be

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,519
speaking to you all today and uh looking

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,759
forward to a quick and exciting session

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,079
um my name is casey ellis the talk today

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,920
is on time for a change why it's more

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,840
important than ever to revisit the cfaa

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,359
before we get into that just a little

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,400
bit of housekeeping i am not a lawyer

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,000
the lawyers that have given input to the

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
projects that i'll discuss here are not

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,238
your lawyers this is not legal advice

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,320
and no lawyers were harmed during the

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,559
creation of this presentation so you

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,920
know what we're going to be talking

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,120
about is a fair bit of

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,640
kind of content material around the

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,879
legal frameworks that exist around good

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,719
faith security research

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,920
you know what we've tried to do is

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,160
create tools to make uh you know

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,840
improvement in that area as easy as

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,520
possible for everyone but you should

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,600
always seek your own legal advice so

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,280
getting that part out of the way all

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,199
right who is this guy my name's casey

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,280
ellis i'm the founder chairman and cto

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,520
of buck crowd i've been in information

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,760
security for about 20 years i've been

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,280
you know monkeying around with computers

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,520
and hacking things my entire life but uh

34
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,360
started the the career in infosec

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,200
straight out of high school my career

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,840
arc is kind of um interesting in the it

37
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,040
started off

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,960
you know just intrigued and messing

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,880
about with stuff i turned that into a

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,280
career in pen testing uh and then moved

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
across into the dark side getting into

42
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,439
solutions architecture and sales

43
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,280
at some point that kind of back of house

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,560
experience and the front of house

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,640
experience got together and conspired i

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,079
got it in my head that i wanted to be an

47
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,960
entrepreneur um and you know did that

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,320
basically um

49
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,560
you know went off and did the did the

50
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,159
startup thing so

51
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
you know as a result of that um you know

52
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,680
very very proud to have pioneered the

53
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,000
crowdsource security as a service model

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,439
uh starting bug crowd out um in 2012. uh

55
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,520
we're an american company i'm actually

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,040
usually based in san francisco i'm

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,200
actually in sydney australia as we

58
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,600
record this hiding out from from covert

59
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,000
uh but normally based in san francisco

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,880
um but started the company from here uh

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,439
moved across to sf in 2012 launched our

62
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,598
first programs in 2012 so you know

63
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,680
having broken ground in the space you

64
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
know at that time it was an incredibly

65
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
novel concept but you know today eight

66
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,360
years later as we talk about it it's

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,560
something that's far more broadly

68
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,720
accepted um you know i'm an aussie i'm a

69
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,160
husband and father too and as i

70
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
mentioned i'm based in san francisco

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,080
normally when it's not unprecedented at

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,920
times as it were

73
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,720
um so just quickly what is bug crowd um

74
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,120
really you know the the the genesis of

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
the idea was out of running a pen

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,959
testing company a combination of running

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,640
a pen testing company and

78
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,959
and seeing the need for human creativity

79
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,959
to be applied to cyber security problems

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,720
like when you think about what

81
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,360
we're trying to do it's it's a creative

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,720
problem set you know software

83
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,319
development software creation the

84
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,400
deployment of systems that all involves

85
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
human creativity um it's not a

86
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,720
technology problem at its root uh the

87
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
technology just makes it go faster and

88
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,040
makes it more impactful um

89
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,959
when you think about the the adversary

90
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,200
you know they're creative as well so

91
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,720
really the idea behind bug crowd was

92
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,840
this idea of

93
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,080
so the concept behind bug crowd was

94
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,680
really how do we take the latent

95
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,159
creativity and the latent potential that

96
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,920
exists in the white hat hacker community

97
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,599
from all around the world

98
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,200
and actually plug it into where the

99
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
problems exist and where questions need

100
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,959
to be answered in in the cyber security

101
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,200
market right across the board

102
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,560
you know the whole idea that kind of got

103
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,400
it going was was seeing

104
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,480
you know bug bounty programs the likes

105
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,879
of uh you know netscape and google and

106
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,400
facebook you know kind of making that

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,040
concept popular at the time or at least

108
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,000
making it kind of a thought about idea

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
and something that people starting to

110
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,319
consider um really what we've

111
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,480
worked on ever since is this idea of not

112
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,000
just facilitating vulnerability

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,239
disclosure and bug benny programs but

114
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,720
really like plugging every available

115
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,360
person who wants to do this type of work

116
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,879
into the problems that are available for

117
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,640
them to actually connect to you know

118
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,959
solve and and then obviously earn money

119
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,040
and earn a living from so that's what we

120
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,959
do as an organization uh bug bounty

121
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,080
programs

122
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
as you would know them um in terms of

123
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,319
public programs

124
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,160
you know crowdsource penetration testing

125
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,759
attack surface management and

126
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,440
vulnerability disclosure programs and

127
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,120
that fourth piece is a lot of what we're

128
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
going to talk about today so let's get

129
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,960
into that

130
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,520
now that my spiel is done

131
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,080
so agenda past how do we get here when

132
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479
we're talking about um the legalities

133
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,360
and

134
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,160
and really the legal kind of backdrop to

135
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,560
good faith security research and and

136
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,040
making the internet a safer place like

137
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,800
what's the back story uh the president

138
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
where are we up to i'll talk about some

139
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,400
data that we've gathered out of the

140
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,080
disclosure project and a few other

141
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
things and just talk about kind of the

142
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,960
current state of conversation around

143
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,880
legal frameworks and so on

144
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,960
and in the future how do we improve um

145
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,639
you know what i'm what i'm going to do

146
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,160
at that section of the talk is actually

147
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,320
talk you all through the disclosure

148
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,560
project itself um which is you know

149
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,160
something that i'll i will not preempt

150
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
right now but that's basically something

151
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,000
that you know i know owasp has an

152
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
incredible and a rich history

153
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,120
of

154
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,199
you know basically turning security into

155
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,039
a team sport disclosure is an open

156
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,919
source project uh and and hopefully this

157
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,320
will encourage a bunch of you to either

158
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,160
adopt what's going on there or actually

159
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,479
contribute and help out so let's do that

160
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,960
all right how did we get here what is

161
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,039
the cfa um

162
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,800
yeah it's it's an interesting one i've

163
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
got the uh i had the hackers backdrop

164
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,440
before i changed it to usual suspects

165
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,639
because it didn't quite fit into the

166
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,759
frame but

167
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,600
as we're recording this it's the 25th

168
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,520
anniversary of the hackers movie

169
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,840
this is another you know hacker classic

170
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
war games

171
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,440
the interesting thing about this movie

172
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,759
is that ronald reagan actually saw it at

173
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,360
camp david basically kind of freaked out

174
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,720
and and went back and spoke to the doj

175
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,880
and a whole bunch of anti-hacking law

176
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,600
was the product of that so so the cfa

177
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,240
that we deal with today was really the

178
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,759
product of hollywood thanks guys um and

179
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,680
honestly at the time it was actually i

180
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
think a fairly appropriate

181
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,280
measure because the internet back then

182
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
doesn't look anything like what it looks

183
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,240
today um so really that's that's kind of

184
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,360
you know

185
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,199
the back story of how that law came to

186
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,360
pass and you know the challenge with it

187
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,240
is that there's been some evolution of

188
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,440
of the law itself over the past

189
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,280
were where are we up to now 35 years um

190
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
but not a whole lot and and what we've

191
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,319
seen

192
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,680
you know alongside that is this

193
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
incredible acceleration of of the

194
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,120
engagement of good faith security

195
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,800
research as a part of the internet's

196
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
immune system and the way that it keeps

197
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
itself safe and understands where its

198
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,400
issues are so so they can be fixed all

199
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,840
of that good stuff

200
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
the law is basically trailing behind

201
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,759
that so what do we do about that which

202
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,720
is kind of what we're going to go

203
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,400
through today

204
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,199
so in terms of backstory

205
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,720
i'm just having some trouble advancing

206
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,520
the slides here

207
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,039
so in terms of backstory around you know

208
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,240
bug bounties and vulnerability

209
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,440
disclosure in 1995 netscape launched the

210
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,919
bugs bounty program uh they dropped the

211
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,560
s later because it's cleaner and yes

212
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,720
that was a social network joke for those

213
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,880
who missed it um

214
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,680
yeah

215
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,199
there's been

216
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,360
like the idea of basically putting

217
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,160
rewards out for people to to you know

218
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,639
test security systems it's been around

219
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,520
for centuries uh people used to do locks

220
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,440
prior to the internet and the technology

221
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,960
industry showing up but you know

222
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,440
netscape's broadly accepted as the the

223
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,120
first technology bug bounty as we know

224
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,720
them today right

225
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
uh in 2008 google and facebook started

226
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,199
off their programs and really that was

227
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,240
when

228
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,919
there started to be a bunch of noise

229
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,599
generated around this idea that kind of

230
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,120
broke out of the

231
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,599
you know almost the echo chamber of you

232
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,160
know vulnerability research uh prior to

233
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
that point in time at that point the

234
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,840
rest of the security industry started to

235
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
sit up and take notice and some people

236
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,440
in technology outside of security

237
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,800
started to understand what was going on

238
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,639
as well

239
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,560
really you know that's where

240
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
kind of i got involved in this stuff

241
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
from a a commercial and a career

242
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,400
standpoint you know having been involved

243
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
with the hacker community for a long

244
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,879
time prior to that seeing

245
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,919
the intrigue frankly that organizations

246
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,759
were kind of showing

247
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,719
around this idea of just being able to

248
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,159
access the talent

249
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
you know the entire talent the internet

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,320
has available to be able to help make

251
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,479
them more secure and this idea of like

252
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,080
if we're trying to outsmart an army of

253
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,680
adversaries then having access to an

254
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,920
army of allies makes sense so bada bing

255
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
bada boom you've got you've got bug

256
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,160
crowd um and about a year into that we

257
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,600
we noticed a couple of things that were

258
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,920
pretty interesting um you know is where

259
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,720
as we're basically trying to make

260
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty

261
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,200
programs easy and and you know connects

262
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,560
these two very different groups of

263
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,120
people to have a productive conversation

264
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,279
there's a centerpiece of that that whole

265
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,560
kind of

266
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,959
interaction um that is the program brief

267
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,480
and the legal language that exists

268
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,320
within the program brief and we noticed

269
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,160
a couple of things it was you know the

270
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
first i think was the fact that like the

271
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,800
legal teams that the companies that we

272
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,720
worked with at that point in time this

273
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,399
is still true today

274
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,240
aren't used to the idea of inviting

275
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,399
hackers to come in and poke around their

276
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,160
stuff like we've got

277
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,000
you know 30 years of technology law

278
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,680
that's basically focused around the idea

279
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,000
of saying no go away and now we're

280
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
trying to find ways to say hey if you're

281
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,959
helpful um yeah that's okay like how do

282
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,200
we do that so the the legal teams in

283
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,360
general just weren't quite sure how to

284
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240
approach

285
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,519
um this whole thing uh and lawyers

286
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,279
have a tendency when they're uncertain

287
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,000
to basically trend towards verbosity

288
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,920
they'll write war and peace and that's

289
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,120
their job they're actually doing the

290
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
right thing from from a legal standpoint

291
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
but the problem that that creates is

292
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,399
that the hackers

293
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
on the other side that are trying to

294
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
read and interpret these briefs you know

295
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,839
half of them are english as a second

296
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,760
language not very many of them have a

297
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,399
legal background there's basically

298
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,920
almost like the euler problem that you

299
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,480
have with you know itunes or installing

300
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
an application on your computer like you

301
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,399
you should read it ideally you know

302
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,320
everyone would read every euler before

303
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,480
they accept it but the reality is that

304
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,320
people tend not to they'll either gloss

305
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,480
over it or completely ignore it right

306
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,079
and we saw a similar thing happening

307
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,000
with what we were doing

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,760
this is a problem because

309
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,600
um you know the whole idea around the

310
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,240
cfaa is that if you're

311
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,680
you know we'll get into this in a second

312
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
if you're touching a computer or if

313
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,880
you're interacting with a computer in a

314
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,399
way that you haven't been authorized

315
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,279
to

316
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,560
to do

317
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
it's potentially a felony crime in the

318
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,640
united states and the thing about that

319
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,480
this is not just about the cfa it's

320
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,240
actually about equivalent any hacking

321
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,720
laws that exist all around the world

322
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,480
so okay that's not great

323
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
um what is the cfa it basically

324
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,440
prohibits behaviors that exceed

325
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,120
authorized access to a protected

326
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,600
computer or the accessing of a protected

327
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,680
computer without authorized access so

328
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,120
you're either exceeding or you're

329
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,720
touching something that you just haven't

330
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,240
been told you can touch in the first

331
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,279
place

332
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,360
the challenge with the way that this law

333
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,560
has been written

334
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,320
and and the way that it's phrased is

335
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
that protected computer

336
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,399
is incredibly broad it was actually

337
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,399
intended at the time to

338
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,480
cover government systems

339
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,760
but the way it was written it was

340
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920
anything that's communicating across

341
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,160
state lines or internationally which is

342
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,600
pretty much every computer that's on the

343
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,040
internet right now so it brings

344
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
everything into scope that someone

345
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,440
else's computer or that you know has the

346
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,920
ability to to connect to the internet

347
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,839
and why i call that as it is different

348
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,800
from

349
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,079
from

350
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,600
you know laws like the digital

351
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,279
millennium copyright act where it's more

352
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,480
about software that you can actually

353
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,079
hold in your hands that's more relevant

354
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,959
to things like iot and and so on so okay

355
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,800
there's that and then this whole idea of

356
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
authorized access well if i'm doing

357
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,639
security testing

358
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,800
exceeding authorized access is probably

359
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,440
one of my goals so

360
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,480
how do you

361
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,839
how do you make that safer for the

362
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,279
people that are actually trying to

363
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,560
trying to do that in good faith and

364
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,000
actually try to help make things more

365
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,440
secure not to act as a adversary in in

366
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
in doing all of that

367
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,600
and i think the challenge with the cfa

368
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,639
you know since it was instantiated

369
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,880
is that it really is being used um you

370
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
know what what we've seen and and what

371
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,720
we've heard from

372
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,880
you know people like the eff and and the

373
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,279
department of justice and so on is that

374
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,839
when it comes to actual prosecutions

375
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,000
that make it in front of a a judge and

376
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
jury

377
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,680
the cfaa tends to be used correctly

378
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,399
there are examples even recently of of

379
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,639
1030s that have been prosecuted

380
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,720
they do tend to be folks that you know

381
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,079
in context of the conversation we're

382
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,760
having right now it's not a security

383
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,120
researcher that's

384
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,880
you know kind of stumbled into something

385
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,800
that they've then been pursued for it's

386
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,480
usually actual

387
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,639
you know criminal behavior or things

388
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,800
that you know are alleged to be criminal

389
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,440
behavior um the challenge is that it it

390
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,839
really does create this chilling effect

391
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,440
around security research i'll give some

392
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,839
examples of how that how that plays out

393
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,959
shortly

394
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,200
it's less about whether you actually get

395
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,519
you know vanned and and the books thrown

396
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,040
at you from a legal standpoint it's more

397
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,360
around the fact that that's possible um

398
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,519
that's the thing that is

399
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,360
chilling and has been chilling to

400
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,959
security researchers for a very long

401
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,720
time and there has been plenty of

402
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,560
examples where the cfa has been used

403
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,079
i'll give a few of those

404
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,839
in a moment so

405
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,120
yeah we're thinking about all of this

406
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,720
stuff as bug crowd trying to you know

407
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,399
trying to grow as an organization trying

408
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,000
to basically change the perception of

409
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,360
hackers from

410
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,480
just being you know burglars to also you

411
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,079
know potentially being locksmiths in the

412
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,880
eyes of of the industry and that part i

413
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,560
think has actually been quite successful

414
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
um at this point in time

415
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,480
you know hackers there's still

416
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,360
a stigma and and you know work to be

417
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
done there but we've gone from being the

418
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
default bad guy to being potentially

419
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,600
helpful which i think is actually pretty

420
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,519
pretty cool um

421
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,720
but really we were looking at all of

422
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,399
that and we started asking ourselves how

423
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,399
do we make it easy to do this well like

424
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,399
if we're trying to create briefs that

425
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,480
are legally complete that you know

426
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,399
address both sides that are easy to

427
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,160
understand how can we make this easy to

428
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,199
do well

429
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,920
um so in 2014 we released the open

430
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
source vulnerability disclosure

431
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
framework uh in collaboration with

432
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,320
cipher law out of dc um

433
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,839
you know at the same time the iso

434
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,360
standards were being released so there

435
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,120
was a few a few people kind of

436
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,560
triangulating all on the same problem

437
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,120
which was awesome uh between 2014 and

438
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,240
2017 what we saw was the osvdf being

439
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,480
basically copy pasted and translated

440
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,320
into different languages and that

441
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,399
original language is kind of everywhere

442
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,720
now at this point which is really how

443
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
this works you know what we observed was

444
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,360
the idea of like prior art and copy

445
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,440
pasta you know legal templating and

446
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,839
boiler plating was was fairly common it

447
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,600
was something that legal teams and

448
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,120
people trying to stand up these programs

449
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,959
were actually doing to to make those

450
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,040
things work so that was an interesting

451
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,680
data point uh in 2018 mean elders there

452
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,359
are el eller excuse me

453
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,800
in 2018 emit el azari started hitting

454
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
the the talk circuit talking about safe

455
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,160
harbor

456
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,399
a drop box launched there safe harbor

457
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,560
clauses in their program and then really

458
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,320
what we started to do

459
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,399
in context of bug crowd and the osvdf

460
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,079
was collaborate with all those folk and

461
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,920
try to figure out how we can like how do

462
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,680
we blow this up how do we make it easy

463
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,120
to do this well how do we do that

464
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
together right

465
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,519
in 2018 we decided yep okay it's time

466
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,360
that we actually spun this out into its

467
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,000
own its own project its own brand its

468
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
own you know potential organization

469
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,320
we're actually pursuing 501c3 for

470
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,959
disclosure right now um

471
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,639
and we basically

472
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,440
you know took our project legal bug

473
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
bounty and a few other things and

474
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,800
brought them all together into the

475
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,199
into the disclosure project itself

476
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,600
uh and in 2019 bug crowd started adding

477
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
this language to programs by default

478
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,959
we've seen it adopted elsewhere as well

479
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,040
so you know going back to this chilling

480
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,720
effect like 60

481
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,800
of good faith hackers don't submit

482
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,480
vulnerabilities for fear of legal

483
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,079
retribution so these are people that

484
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,079
haven't necessarily

485
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,440
been prosecuted or even necessarily

486
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
arrested they've just had

487
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,759
um you know negative interactions with

488
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,320
organizations uh or you know they've

489
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,240
they've heard of others that have that

490
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,560
have had those sorts of interactions and

491
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,079
they're not submitting vulnerabilities

492
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,920
they're not actually participating in

493
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
their capacity to make the internet a

494
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,480
safer place because this law

495
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,279
is so ambiguous if you're a good person

496
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,120
doing things to just kind of wander a

497
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,720
little bit off into territory that could

498
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,199
be considered a bad thing and you end up

499
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,639
working with a company that's having a

500
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,759
bad day

501
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,920
that's not a good thing so this is a

502
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,160
this is a problem that we need to solve

503
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,759
an example of where this actually

504
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,680
happens practically

505
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,400
kevin feinstein's phenomenal guy

506
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,640
knows all sorts of incredible things

507
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,599
about

508
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,240
the security of drones and he did a fair

509
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,119
bit of work on the dji bug bounty

510
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,039
program

511
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,720
and when i say a fair bit of work some

512
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,240
of the vulnerabilities that kevin

513
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,799
started to identify and pass across to

514
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,559
dji started to make them a little bit

515
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,439
concerned so they they were

516
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,320
unhappy and and basically trying to

517
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,640
chill and control the security research

518
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,160
that kevin was doing

519
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,720
um i'll you know make these slides

520
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,400
available so you can actually read this

521
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,559
letter it's it's quite a read it's it's

522
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,960
actually very threatening it's you know

523
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,559
talking about all sorts of legal action

524
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,760
coming from all sorts of different

525
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,440
places including

526
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,679
you know the use of the cfa in a federal

527
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,679
context you know basically accusing

528
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,039
kevin of a felony crime um

529
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,400
none of that stuff should have happened

530
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,080
in the first place like the the fact

531
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,919
that that they'd gone out and actually

532
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,160
put together a bounty brief and got it

533
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,120
out there and invited this input

534
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,960
would have suggested that this is

535
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,080
probably not something that's going to

536
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,320
happen it happened anyway so again the

537
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
question becomes how do we make it easy

538
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
to do this well and avoid situations

539
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,480
like this avoid chilling the input of

540
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,919
people like kevin into making the

541
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,039
internet a safer place

542
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,240
so that's backstory um the present you

543
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
know in terms of where we're up to i

544
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,799
think the thing that that really drives

545
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,720
a lot of

546
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,799
you know acceptance and acceptance in a

547
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,799
way that rolls up into the reformation

548
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,480
of of laws

549
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,840
um

550
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,080
it goes to adoption it's like how you

551
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,240
know i mentioned just before how you

552
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
know hackers have gone from being the

553
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,559
kind of the boogeyman to to being you

554
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,320
know potentially helpful to being even

555
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,200
invited and celebrated by by you know

556
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,559
all sorts of different parts of the

557
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,320
internet which is which is a fantastic

558
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,480
thing we've seen a bunch of other stuff

559
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,880
in terms of the adoption of

560
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,799
you know this whole kind of core concept

561
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,320
of vulnerability disclosure and actually

562
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,400
inviting input from the outside world

563
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
which is what i'm going to go into in

564
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,880
this section

565
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,000
um as a part of disclose io we have a a

566
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,200
tool set uh called the uh

567
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,360
we call it dios we haven't figured out

568
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
if we should acronym it or just use it

569
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,679
as a word but dials we'll we'll do for

570
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,840
now what that's doing is actually going

571
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,480
out you you basically feed it it's a go

572
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,760
script

573
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,799
um that you feed input and it goes out

574
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,080
and checks for the presence of a

575
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,919
security.text file

576
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,240
uh passes that file you know dumps out

577
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,840
the format into json that's compatible

578
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,760
with some other components of disclosure

579
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,919
that i'll get to shortly and it's pretty

580
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,080
interesting what we've seen it spitting

581
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,360
out like within the top 100 000 websites

582
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,320
on uh according to alexa

583
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,640
there's 933 of them

584
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,320
in total so that's like less than one

585
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,679
percent that have a security text uh

586
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,080
file in place in the first place

587
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,320
and of those uh 933 programs only about

588
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,520
50 of them have a policy um that's

589
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,679
important because without a policy all

590
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,120
you're really doing is establishing a

591
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
communication channel like from from bug

592
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,039
crowd's perspective and i think this is

593
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,600
a broadly accepted um

594
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
you know kind of definition of a

595
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,360
vulnerability disclosure program at this

596
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,520
point you can have an intake channel but

597
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,200
without a policy no one knows what's

598
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,039
okay and what's not okay so you have to

599
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,799
have those two things together and you

600
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,080
can kind of see

601
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,120
you know

602
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,440
one percent in in the top

603
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,240
100 000 is actually indicative i think

604
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,320
at the fact that you know

605
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,679
companies that are popular on the

606
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,440
internet tend to be more progressive and

607
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,720
more understanding of these types of

608
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,360
things and that's frankly you know our

609
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,280
theory for why that's

610
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,120
higher than it is for the 1 million

611
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,039
which is where it's less than the tenth

612
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,240
of a percent

613
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,880
um and in the 10 million it's it's half

614
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,960
half tenth of a percent so

615
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
you know it's it's one of these areas

616
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,600
where we're seeing

617
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,919
you know people use these tools and and

618
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,159
and get these things out there uh in a

619
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,840
way that makes you know vulnerability

620
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,400
disclosure programs and the ability to

621
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,039
actually you know submit issues to them

622
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,760
identifiable to uh to the internet and

623
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,360
not just the security community but the

624
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,440
internet at large

625
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,960
but there's still a pretty long way to

626
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
go

627
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,799
yeah another data point that we've got

628
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,960
is is through uh

629
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,600
the disclose io list this is actually a

630
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,200
tweet that goes out fairly regularly

631
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
from the disclosure twitter uh and what

632
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,440
we're doing there is essentially

633
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,320
enumerating the safe harbor status which

634
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,280
i'll get to shortly uh on on all the

635
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,480
different programs that we've actually

636
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
got logged within our database at this

637
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,480
point in time so you know 973 programs

638
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,360
141 of them 14.5 with what we consider

639
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,080
to be full authorization um you know

640
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,360
21.5 percent with partial and and so on

641
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,320
so

642
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,840
you know again there's progress what

643
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,000
we've seen with this number is it's gone

644
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,080
up you know fairly steadily over time um

645
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,400
yeah and it continues to do that you

646
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,919
know really what we'd like to see is for

647
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,960
it to do that faster

648
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,600
with respect to the cfa itself um

649
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,039
there's some pretty interesting stuff

650
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,320
going on

651
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,720
the the van buren case which is which is

652
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,320
actually currently up in front of the

653
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,080
supreme court

654
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,960
is

655
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,520
an interesting read uh you know there's

656
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,880
there's some

657
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,039
some stuff that happened that you know

658
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,039
essentially i won't go into that side of

659
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,039
it but really what it's done is actually

660
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,559
brought the cfa into question in terms

661
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,200
of how it's interpreted um

662
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
and that has the ability or the the

663
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,360
potential to set precedent for how it's

664
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,520
used in the future so that got a lot of

665
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,960
attention from

666
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,799
from us from from you know the

667
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,520
electronic frontiers foundation from the

668
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
center for democracy and technology and

669
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,360
and so on we put together what's called

670
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,840
an amicus uh brief um which is

671
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
essentially a friends of the court brief

672
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,320
um where we go in and say okay

673
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,280
you know here's what you're trying to

674
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,039
figure out with with how you're

675
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,440
interpreting the cfaa like this is a

676
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,919
component of that decision that you

677
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,799
probably should consider uh and and that

678
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,039
particular brief really does go through

679
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,159
you know the role of security

680
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,320
researchers on the internet um you know

681
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,760
the fact that cfaa has been chilling to

682
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,919
to a lot of good work uh and that it

683
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,000
continues to be so and the fact that it

684
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,799
should be narrowed in its definition to

685
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,799
you know make it more focused on actual

686
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,440
bad faith actors and and not catch good

687
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,679
faith actors in

688
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,440
in its kind of definition and covering

689
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,400
so

690
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,159
that was a that was a pretty exciting

691
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,360
thing um

692
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,159
unfortunately we had a

693
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,240
uh a vendor

694
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,960
by the name of votes who who uh are

695
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,039
trying to put elections on the

696
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,640
blockchain um

697
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,440
basically write a brief saying no

698
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,200
you can't

699
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,640
tell the difference between someone

700
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,880
who's who's conducting security research

701
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,559
in good faith versus someone who's doing

702
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,400
that in bad faith

703
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,080
you know the cfa

704
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,159
should be broadened

705
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,960
to basically have it hinge on

706
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,799
authorization so only people that have

707
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,720
been authorized to do security testing

708
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,559
in any circumstance should be allowed to

709
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,360
do that otherwise it's illegal

710
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,559
which clearly um i don't agree with nor

711
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,679
did

712
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,400
uh about 70 other security researchers

713
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,039
organizations some congress people and

714
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,520
and others that responded on this

715
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,279
on this letter here so

716
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,440
yeah i think just as a as a practical

717
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,039
piece like this is the kind of thing

718
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,640
that's ongoing right now like as this

719
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,159
goes to air

720
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,080
this conversation around van buren is

721
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,279
actually going to be

722
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,400
progressed

723
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,279
um

724
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,679
so you know reading up on understanding

725
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,240
you know what your um

726
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,919
own viewpoint is like forming that

727
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,840
viewpoint and understanding what that is

728
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,279
uh but then you're doing whatever you

729
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,039
need to with it it's an election year

730
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,440
there's also different ways that i i

731
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,039
think the input of experts that

732
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,039
understand this type of thing can can be

733
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,120
brought to bear in order to get a good

734
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,440
outcome for you know security research

735
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,799
and for the safety of the internet

736
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,520
itself um as well as that we had you

737
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,400
know signatories um

738
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,559
again by the time this goes to air we're

739
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,400
going to have the ability for

740
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,039
others to actually sign on and uh and

741
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,760
and basically agree with the letter um

742
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,440
you know from a petitioning standpoint

743
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,799
so that's that's another thing that you

744
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,960
can do as a call to action

745
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,080
all right so

746
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,200
cool

747
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,760
this is sort of where it's up to um

748
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,360
you know going back to uh the the the

749
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,760
back story piece of the presentation

750
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,000
really where we got to thinking as we

751
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,640
started disclosio and as that that's

752
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,000
progressed is you know how do we make

753
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,760
the adoption of vulnerability disclosure

754
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,240
with best practice so not just have

755
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,679
organizations

756
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,679
accept the input of security research

757
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,320
and actually invite that

758
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,480
but to have them do that well like have

759
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,640
them extend things like you know

760
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,960
authorization against cfaa and so on how

761
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,279
do we make that go viral

762
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,919
and that brings me to the next section

763
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,760
of this talk i'm keeping an eye on time

764
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,919
here so how do we improve

765
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,360
and this is where i'm going to introduce

766
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,320
disguise io itself as a as a project

767
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,480
so really the vision of disclose io is

768
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,880
is a healthy and a ubiquitous internet

769
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,559
immune system um you know our our view

770
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,360
and i think the view of of most folk

771
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,520
that that work in

772
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,360
this kind of aspect of vulnerability

773
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,960
management that involves the security

774
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,200
research community is that security

775
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,480
researchers are kind of like the

776
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,039
internet's immune system like we we run

777
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,360
around we find things that need to be

778
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,600
fixed or need to be addressed uh we work

779
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,279
on those things and

780
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,559
kind of the problem that the internet

781
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,039
has right now is is almost equivalent to

782
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,600
an autoimmune deficiency or disease like

783
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,000
there's a rejection of that help that

784
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,080
consistently goes on

785
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,600
and ultimately that means that

786
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,919
everything is less resilient less safe

787
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,080
less healthy and we want to solve that

788
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,240
um credit to

789
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,200
uh karen elizari for for the internet

790
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,600
immune system um analogy she did a

791
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,400
fantastic ted talk probably about six or

792
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,480
seven years ago now um that actually

793
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,159
established that that analogy and i

794
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,240
think it it's perfect

795
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,279
um so really the way or the the mission

796
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,520
of disclose io is to drive vulnerability

797
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,360
disclosure adoption through safety

798
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,440
simplicity and standardization and i

799
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,440
will say again like this this started

800
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,760
out of bug crowd um at this point in

801
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,039
time there's all sorts of different

802
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,720
folks that are contributing to it it's

803
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,159
an open source project that we've

804
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,279
actually worked pretty hard to make

805
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,440
agnostic to to bug out as an

806
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,880
organization like

807
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,520
bug crowd benefits from this type of

808
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,760
thing because if you know the the

809
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,840
internet's more accepting of of security

810
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,000
research everything we do becomes that

811
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,320
little bit easier but really the design

812
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,360
goal of disclosure is for it to

813
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,440
actually function independent and and

814
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,679
you know above uh what we're doing as an

815
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,760
organization of bug crab so just to call

816
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,360
that out

817
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,279
all right so what are the what are the

818
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,679
components of of disclosure there's the

819
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,840
terms that we've put together

820
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,039
um

821
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,720
and really what they are they're boiler

822
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,240
plates it's it's really this idea of you

823
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,320
know being able to going back to the

824
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,840
explanation i gave at the start around

825
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,799
the us vdf you know how can we

826
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,840
have like good copy pasta on on you know

827
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,320
bug bounty boilerplate briefs

828
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
um that are actually going to be useful

829
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
so it's it's not something that is like

830
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,240
a check box and you're done it's it's

831
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,880
it's useful from a legal standpoint it's

832
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,520
useful from a readability standpoint um

833
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,279
and it's easy to access for all sorts of

834
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,039
different organizations we've seen

835
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,960
people just copy paste it we've seen

836
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,399
people use it as a foundation for their

837
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,240
own framework we've seen people use it

838
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,520
as a starting point for their own

839
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,279
versions um all of which is uh is stuff

840
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,200
that we want to you know see continue

841
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,120
that was like literally the the stated

842
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,640
goal um

843
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,360
and

844
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
you know on the on the right here um

845
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,200
just to be clear to call out these

846
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,640
aren't

847
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,159
endorsements of the project from the

848
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,799
organizations themselves uh the reason

849
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,320
that these logos are up here it's the

850
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,919
kind of organizations that people that

851
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,840
are contributing this to this project

852
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,679
are coming from so it's not just you

853
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,760
know casey the bush lawyer and

854
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,600
and and a bunch of other folk from the

855
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,039
hacker community doing this we're

856
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,039
actually bringing in and actually you

857
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,279
know frankly fielding interest

858
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,679
from from the kinds of people that can

859
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,080
really do this well um from all sorts of

860
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,080
different parts of of of the internet

861
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,520
all sorts of different organizations

862
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,360
government and so on so

863
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,679
that part's pretty exciting um

864
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,320
when we're putting together the terms uh

865
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
you know i touched on this before it's

866
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
it's kind of hard um

867
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,919
to be honest because you know what we

868
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,480
have to do is balance this idea of legal

869
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,120
completeness uh against some of these

870
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,200
kind of overarching laws that are very

871
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
vague and require a fair bit of

872
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,520
clarification you know how do you make

873
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,320
that clarity as complete as possible

874
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,440
whilst keeping it readable and brief

875
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,080
and also whilst you know maintaining the

876
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,760
safety of

877
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,320
the organization as well as the hacker

878
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,640
so as a company that's trying to launch

879
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,440
a vdp and and that wants to do that well

880
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,279
what you don't want to do is put legal

881
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,880
terminology out there that says hey

882
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,320
everyone can come and do whatever they

883
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,200
want

884
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
and i forfeit my right to any recourse

885
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,960
for an actual bad faith actor like that

886
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,279
would be a bad outcome so how can you

887
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,960
you know balance that out to make sure

888
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,640
that you're protecting people that are

889
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,320
operating in good faith

890
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,399
while still maintaining your recourse

891
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,000
towards those that might be attacking

892
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,159
you for real um

893
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,480
it's pretty interesting like we've we've

894
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,240
you know put a lot of work into this the

895
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,440
the the

896
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,840
biggest challenge and i think a a call

897
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,120
for

898
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,960
you know participation and and help from

899
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,640
the os community from an open source

900
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,480
standpoint is actually around

901
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,039
translation and and making sure that

902
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,799
you know the legal terms communicate

903
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,279
across language barriers um you know

904
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,000
half of like more than half i would say

905
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,720
of of the hackers that participate in in

906
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,399
in these types of things that would

907
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,760
actually need to read and understand

908
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,200
this type of thing they're not

909
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,679
necessarily thinking or speaking in

910
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,840
english as their first language so

911
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,360
there's an element of translation that's

912
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,360
already in play and we've tried to be

913
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,880
mindful of things like that and how we

914
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,679
put this uh these these terms together

915
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,760
um yeah so

916
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,039
it's a good thing

917
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,039
uh and really what we're doing is we're

918
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,039
extending it out into uh you know

919
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,799
different

920
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,480
regions different geographies we

921
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,120
actually wrote a a version that's been

922
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,320
adopted

923
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,600
um or used as a as a foundation

924
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,760
foundational template by the state of

925
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,799
ohio

926
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,279
and uh esns and some of the other voting

927
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,200
machine manufacturers as well around

928
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,279
election security i can tell you that

929
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,640
writing a

930
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,880
vulnerability disclosure program brief

931
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,679
for

932
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,559
uh an election system

933
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,600
set

934
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,799
within a state that's that's a pretty

935
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,080
interesting thing to do because it's

936
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,159
quite a diverse attack surface and

937
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,159
there's a lot of players involved so

938
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,760
yeah it's it's those sorts of problems

939
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,039
that we're trying to solve with with

940
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,320
these boilerplates that we're putting

941
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,480
together and again from an open source

942
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,559
contribution standpoint you know

943
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,640
submitting prs if there's

944
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,399
local language translation that you feel

945
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,320
you can do if there's local

946
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,880
knowledge of laws you know outside of

947
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,880
the u.s outside of

948
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
at the moment there's

949
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,519
canada the us and the netherlands

950
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,600
covered um and we'd love to see more

951
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,360
countries in there so if you've got you

952
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,760
know local legal or local language

953
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,399
knowledge of of a jurisdiction and would

954
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,320
like to actually translate the terms

955
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,159
please submit a pr or get in touch that

956
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,399
would be fantastic

957
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,640
yeah

958
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,399
all right next up in terms of what we're

959
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,880
doing uh there's the list so the list is

960
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,360
really it's it's a community powered

961
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,519
vendor agnostic directory of all known

962
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,840
vdps and bugbendy programs

963
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,600
it's essentially a big json blob that

964
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,640
sits on sits on github

965
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,559
and really the idea of it is for it to

966
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,559
be as as you know broadly contributed to

967
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,279
and broadly consumable as possible we

968
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,760
don't want to make it proprietary uh or

969
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,399
you know kind of focused or tilted it in

970
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,840
any particular direction we just want

971
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,480
this active you know kind of true

972
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,919
directory of

973
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,279
you know all of the different places

974
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,360
that you could potentially go off and do

975
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,039
proactive security research if that's

976
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,480
what you're looking for or if you're

977
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,080
looking for someone to actually you know

978
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
submit an issue once you've found one

979
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,720
this can serve that purpose as well

980
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,399
uh it's up there in json csv uh you know

981
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,559
the probably the big call out with with

982
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,480
the terms and with the list is that

983
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,000
they're both licensed under cca 4.0 so

984
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,720
it's

985
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,200
it's open source it's you know free for

986
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,600
reuse for repurposing with attribution

987
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,399
so

988
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,080
that's that's kind of the spirit of how

989
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,480
we put all of that together

990
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,919
i think the piece that i get excited

991
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,399
about is is is this one um

992
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,399
this is the seal

993
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,279
and and really where we'd love to you

994
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,399
know the people that are working on this

995
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,760
project and myself would love to see

996
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,440
this get to was the idea of the seal

997
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,760
almost becoming like the green padlock

998
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,839
uh of of you know vulnerability

999
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,359
disclosure and

1000
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,280
you know the the right kind of like

1001
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
legalities and channels and frameworks

1002
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,719
being put in place

1003
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,879
behind that and and i use the green

1004
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,719
padlock deliberately knowing full world

1005
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,079
that that's in the process of being

1006
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,159
phased out like i would love to see that

1007
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,280
happen

1008
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,440
for this to be a thing where you know

1009
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,280
vulnerability disclosure programs and

1010
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,359
the acceptance and understanding of good

1011
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,440
faith security research is so ubiquitous

1012
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,119
across the internet you just don't even

1013
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,879
need to say it anymore like that would

1014
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,599
be

1015
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,399
a fantastic goal i think a fantastic win

1016
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,639
for everyone we're not there yet so this

1017
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,119
is this is what we're doing next um so

1018
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,879
how we've broken out

1019
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,040
the seal at this point in time is is

1020
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,239
basically

1021
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,440
uh a good faith statement which is uh

1022
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,040
sometimes referred to as partial safe

1023
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,480
harbor and then a explicit authorization

1024
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,640
which is sometimes referred to as full

1025
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,320
safe harbor

1026
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,240
those two things are really important in

1027
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,640
terms of the difference you know partial

1028
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,560
safe harbor or a good faith statement is

1029
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
essentially when you read a

1030
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,400
vulnerability disclosure policy and it

1031
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,960
says words to the effect of if you're

1032
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,800
not a jerk we won't layer up um

1033
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,720
it's better than nothing and you know if

1034
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,560
you go back to the tweet that i posted

1035
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,960
just before um

1036
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,200
not you know the it's actually in the

1037
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,520
minority the the the number of

1038
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,960
vulnerability disclosure program

1039
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,800
policies that have even

1040
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,720
you know a basic good faith statement is

1041
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,960
actually not the majority of the ones

1042
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,560
that are out there so

1043
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,480
you're doing better than

1044
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,839
a program that doesn't have one if

1045
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,440
you've got something like this

1046
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,119
the challenge

1047
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,079
to it is that it it isn't providing

1048
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,839
authorization like

1049
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:54,880
the

1050
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,480
um

1051
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,000
you know under

1052
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,119
the the con

1053
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,760
the problem with this is that it's not

1054
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,359
actually providing explicit

1055
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,960
authorization which is kind of the

1056
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,400
linchpin term

1057
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,640
of cfaa so

1058
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,560
theoretically uh and if you go back to

1059
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,440
the dji case with with kevin this is

1060
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,280
pretty much what happened there

1061
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,480
um

1062
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,720
you know if there's

1063
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,160
vulnerability submitted or if there's

1064
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,400
security research that's that's done

1065
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,680
that

1066
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,400
you know as a organization you don't

1067
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,000
necessarily like

1068
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,440
you can turn back around and say hey

1069
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,200
that was unauthorized and all of a

1070
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,040
sudden you're kind of back to square one

1071
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
so you know i think the risk of that

1072
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,880
happening uh with a good faith statement

1073
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,280
is lower than you know if one doesn't

1074
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
exist at all but it's still incomplete

1075
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,839
so that's where full uh safe harbor or

1076
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,320
explicit authorization kicks in

1077
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,920
and really what that what the deal is

1078
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,040
there is that

1079
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,320
you know you've got legal language which

1080
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,640
obviously is in the templates uh that i

1081
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,320
just mentioned um

1082
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,920
you know you've got legal language that

1083
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,240
that explicitly authorizes good faith

1084
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,640
security research in context of any

1085
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,280
hacking laws like the cfaa

1086
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,920
but it also provides exemption for any

1087
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,920
circumvention laws

1088
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,800
which

1089
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,040
uh you know things like the dmca for

1090
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,760
example um you know making sure that if

1091
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,440
you're doing security research and and

1092
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,760
bypassing circumvention controls in a

1093
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,040
way that could trigger something like

1094
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,680
dmca there's an exemption from that

1095
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,079
there's also an exemption under

1096
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,320
the acceptable use policy or terms of

1097
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,839
service

1098
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,280
which is kind of in the spirit of what

1099
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,280
aaron's law was trying to to basically

1100
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
achieve you know the whole idea there is

1101
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,560
that if you

1102
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,040
if you violate the terms of service uh

1103
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,040
in in the way that you're interacting

1104
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,200
with the computer system or a service

1105
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,040
does that then constitute or

1106
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,119
unauthorized access that that kind of

1107
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,359
brings you into scope for prosecution

1108
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,520
under cfaa um so there's an exemption

1109
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,280
for that and then just a general

1110
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,040
acknowledgement of good faith it's it's

1111
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,800
you know really kind of almost this idea

1112
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,560
of hey like we believe that you're

1113
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,960
trying to do a good thing so let's make

1114
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,520
sure that that's stated and clear

1115
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,359
if you've got those things then

1116
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,240
yep that's full safe harbour um

1117
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,079
well that's that's you know explicit

1118
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,400
authorization in terms of the disclosure

1119
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,599
seal

1120
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,680
and at that point organizations that

1121
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,280
have have met

1122
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,440
kind of the burden of

1123
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,839
of of proof or the burden of you know

1124
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,880
compliance to either of these two things

1125
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,280
they can then display that seal which is

1126
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,280
when it starts to get interesting which

1127
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,119
is what i'm going to get to in the next

1128
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,000
slide

1129
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,960
so

1130
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,119
this is where it starts to go viral

1131
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,520
and this harks back to the whole the the

1132
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,440
picky and the brain slide

1133
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,720
earlier on

1134
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,960
how do we get it to the point where

1135
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,240
it's not

1136
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,320
conversations like this one where people

1137
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,560
like myself and others in the space are

1138
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,280
trying to convince uh program owners

1139
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,720
that doing this well is a good thing

1140
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,640
like how do we just make that

1141
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,960
you know something that that is a is a

1142
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,920
draw it's a pull rather than a push

1143
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,480
and and really this is this is how we're

1144
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,680
looking at it and this is how we're

1145
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,800
actually trying to get this done with

1146
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,040
disclosure you know an organization

1147
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,640
launches a vulnerability disclosure

1148
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,800
program they're added to the list either

1149
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,560
because they do it themselves or because

1150
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,160
you know a hacker or a security

1151
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,400
researcher or you know someone who works

1152
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,359
on disclosio adds them to that list

1153
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,040
if they don't have

1154
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,640
a good faith statement or explicit

1155
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,560
authorization at that point

1156
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,000
they'll notice that

1157
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,680
because they'll come up with a yep no

1158
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,000
you don't have that um

1159
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,280
at which point you know the

1160
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,760
organization's going to go back to the

1161
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,400
repo and see this opportunity for them

1162
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,160
to add terms that are going to make

1163
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,240
their vulnerability disclosure briefs

1164
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,359
safer

1165
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,960
at that point

1166
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,000
safe harbor is is granted or the seal

1167
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,240
rather is actually granted to them

1168
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
they display it and a couple of

1169
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,680
interesting things happened at that

1170
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,440
point their customers see it uh you know

1171
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
the beauty of vulnerability disclosure

1172
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,520
programs i think compared with a lot of

1173
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,440
other security controls that we have is

1174
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,160
that your you know your grandma or your

1175
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,240
grandpa can understand it it's something

1176
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,119
that's accessible as an idea to a

1177
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,680
non-technical uh person because it's

1178
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,119
basically neighborhood watch for the

1179
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,440
internet so as an organization if you've

1180
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,079
got the neighborhood watch sign

1181
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,760
on the front of your website all of a

1182
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,599
sudden your customers are feeling more

1183
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,440
confident and comfortable in your

1184
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,960
product as they're rocking up and making

1185
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,560
a decision whether to buy or not so

1186
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,440
business improves that's good right

1187
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,599
then hackers see it and realize that

1188
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,040
this is an organization that's been

1189
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,359
proactive about making me feel welcome

1190
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,280
as i'm trying to help them out

1191
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,720
so security improves which is good um

1192
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,560
the part that i get really excited about

1193
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,960
and we've seen this in in all sorts of

1194
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,480
different industries through throughout

1195
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,960
the life of bug crowd is that peer

1196
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,599
pressure starts to kick in so the idea

1197
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,640
of you know there being like three banks

1198
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,520
um

1199
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,200
two of them are running bond disclosure

1200
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,440
programs with safe harbor the third one

1201
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,920
isn't all of a sudden that third one is

1202
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,760
starting to look a little behind the

1203
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,160
times and they'll correct and actually

1204
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,200
work to catch up to to be in parity from

1205
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,560
a best practice standpoint with their

1206
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,319
peers and honestly i think that's the

1207
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,319
thing that we need to trigger um

1208
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,480
getting it to the point where

1209
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,720
you know it like vault disclosure and

1210
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,480
interaction with security researchers

1211
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,720
isn't the thing that uh

1212
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,680
the crazy crazy bay area companies do uh

1213
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,160
anymore or people that are you know

1214
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,240
technically aggressive and progressive

1215
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,000
and how they're approaching security

1216
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,160
it's just something that is a normal

1217
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,520
part of being on the internet and

1218
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,800
frankly you're kind of weird if you

1219
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,359
don't do um that's you know what we can

1220
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,160
kind of trigger with this network effect

1221
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,240
and you know given again the uh the

1222
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,880
unprecedented times it it feels

1223
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,480
a little too soon to be talking about in

1224
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,160
terms of you know viral marketing and

1225
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,480
network effect but really that's kind of

1226
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,480
what this is about how do we

1227
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,200
increase the the r naught of of doing it

1228
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,560
right so that's the goal of this project

1229
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,760
um

1230
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,680
you know in terms of how the folks that

1231
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,800
are

1232
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,480
that are watching this and and

1233
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,880
participating uh can

1234
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,640
you be a part of it you know start a

1235
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,560
vulnerability disclosure program if

1236
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,079
you're in a position to do that within

1237
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,160
your organization don't go off half

1238
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,520
cocked and just do it it's something

1239
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,720
that you need to actually think about

1240
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,960
and plan out but like get on that get on

1241
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,680
that train um i think you know

1242
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,400
interaction with security researchers is

1243
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,240
something that everyone who is in the

1244
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,440
security industry is going to need to

1245
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,880
figure out how to do at some point in

1246
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,000
their career

1247
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,839
so the choice right now is to be

1248
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,000
proactive about that or to wait until

1249
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,400
you need to be reactive with that and i

1250
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,240
think proactive is you know probably a

1251
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
better choice um

1252
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,839
if you'll if you're already running a

1253
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,359
volume disclosure program or if you're

1254
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,640
launching one

1255
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,880
you know add those causes like make sure

1256
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,040
that there is either good faith or

1257
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,760
ideally explicit authorization causes in

1258
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,680
your brief enjoy and disclose io like

1259
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,480
display the seal proudly um

1260
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,960
you know get to the point where you're

1261
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,440
not only making hackers feel comfortable

1262
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,119
but you're driving best practice in your

1263
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,359
industry and you're actually signaling

1264
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,119
back up to legislators and people that

1265
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,800
are you know considering whether or not

1266
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,920
it's time to reform the cfa

1267
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,359
you're giving them something to look at

1268
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,040
in terms of you know the groundswell

1269
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,440
support for that idea uh that's

1270
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,960
something that we can all be a part of

1271
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,760
as a team sport um contributing to the

1272
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,319
project uh you know we're at github.com

1273
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,319
disclose um

1274
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,359
you know hello at disclosure uh

1275
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,040
all of those contributions you know

1276
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,640
there's there's a bunch of stuff that

1277
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,839
we've got

1278
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,520
already kind of

1279
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,640
working that really relies on constant

1280
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,720
community input and contribution so so

1281
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,160
being a part of that would be much

1282
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,520
appreciated there's a bunch of tooling

1283
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,359
that we're wanting to work on as well

1284
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,280
you know you saw the security.tech

1285
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,599
scanner there's other variations of that

1286
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,599
that we're working on putting together

1287
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,200
to actually map out the internet so

1288
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,880
folks that you know particularly can

1289
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,359
program in golang and and

1290
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,880
you know can

1291
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,400
work with

1292
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,079
others in an open source tooling

1293
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,240
capacity we'd we'd love to hear from you

1294
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,520
and to be able to work together on that

1295
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,760
as well and then spread the word i you

1296
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,359
know i think again

1297
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,680
the idea of this movement is to

1298
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,319
basically make vol disclosure normal i

1299
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,720
think of the you know i mentioned

1300
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,720
earlier on that bug crowd was the first

1301
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,560
platform to market there's

1302
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,000
at last count 40 or 42

1303
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,839
i believe um

1304
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,920
you know similar to bug crowd platforms

1305
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,359
that exist all around the world at this

1306
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,920
point that's fantastic like honestly

1307
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,440
this is bigger than that i think it's

1308
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,200
it's actually making sure that the

1309
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,640
immune system that the internet can

1310
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,640
function properly um

1311
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,079
and you know i think that's something

1312
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,400
that we can all get behind

1313
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,000
so to sum up

1314
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,359
the cfa and other anti-hacking laws

1315
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,440
do continue to chill good faith security

1316
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,119
research we're seeing

1317
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,640
evidence of that we're seeing things

1318
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,800
that go wrong even as recently as this

1319
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,240
week

1320
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,680
as as we record this talk

1321
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,599
but you know there's been enormous

1322
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,280
progress over the over the last eight

1323
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,720
years

1324
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,079
in spite of that there's still a long

1325
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,640
way to go

1326
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,000
but things are trending in the right

1327
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,760
