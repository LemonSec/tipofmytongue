00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,759
join us at our booth in the virtual expo

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,080
hall to learn how our app protection

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,080
white box cryptography and threat

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,080
analytics solutions can help you stay

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,320
ahead of the evolving threat landscape

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,680
welcome to

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,720
the global wasp apsec san francisco 2020

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,279
my name is amul sarvarde and i'm head of

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,159
security research at cloud passage

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,160
the title of today's session is

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,800
real-time vulnerability alerting by

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,680
using principles from the u.s tsunami

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,640
warning center but before we dive in let

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,719
me give you a brief background

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,440
so at cloud passage in security research

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,719
in addition to the usual product-based

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,000
uh cloud container and server based

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,039
research what we were also looking at is

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,480
we were

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,079
wanting to have a automated and

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,959
real-time vulnerability alerting system

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,360
that could alert us on the most

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,840
prevalent on the most high priority

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,439
vulnerabilities

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,640
so we

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,520
decided to build this system ourselves

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
initially this was meant for internal

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,799
use and now we are trying to expose this

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,960
system to the rest of the world to the

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,799
greater community

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,040
so this presentation is

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,799
a direct

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,840
is in

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,119
is a direct offspring of uh that project

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,320
so let's take a look at the brief agenda

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,479
or the outline for the next few

38
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,600
minutes

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,240
uh we'll introduce the and

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,600
introdu we'll start with some

41
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
introductions and problem definition we

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,320
will go over our approach

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,119
we'll also touch on how we design the

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,520
system what are some of the tools we

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,479
used

46
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,360
what are some of the platforms languages

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,719
and tricks that we

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,840
incorporated in making this system

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
in addition to that we'll go over a host

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,720
of example vulnerabilities that were

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,560
selected by this automated system

52
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,879
and we'll end it with

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,040
some future work and some of the

54
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,879
enhancements and some of the new

55
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,560
features

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,720
that can that need to be added and that

57
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,440
we are in the process of adding to make

58
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,520
uh life better

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,959
so with that brief of outline let's get

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,720
started

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,120
so this uh this is a view of

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
of a tsunami

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,000
but most of our id professionals

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,280
see this

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,599
view every day and instead of tsunami

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,640
what they see is a large

67
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,959
group or a large amount of

68
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,560
vulnerabilities

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,360
coming towards them every day

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,000
it it was the same problem for it

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
professional as well as our own internal

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,920
researchers

73
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
and therefore we developed this system

74
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,480
so that it could give our own internal

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,959
researchers also uh

76
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,599
some guidance on what vulnerabilities to

77
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,800
focus on and what and how to prioritize

78
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,400
them

79
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,840
so this chart that i have on the screen

80
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,680
right now is the number of unique

81
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,959
vulnerabilities out there

82
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,799
and this goes out

83
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,680
from

84
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,360
two decades from when nvidia started

85
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,080
documenting vulnerabilities to

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,840
last year

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,319
if you see in the last three years

88
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,280
on an average there have been about 15

89
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,799
000 unique vulnerabilities

90
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,480
that were listed

91
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,599
now these are unique vulnerabilities you

92
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,480
multiply them by the number of

93
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
viruses worms

94
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
scripts

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,599
exploit packs

96
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,360
and you get a large amount of attacks

97
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,000
based on the unique vulnerabilities as

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,680
you all know like a single unique

99
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,120
vulnerability is used by many types and

100
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,920
many variants of viruses worms threat

101
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,280
actors so on and so forth and multiply

102
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,839
that by the amount of

103
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,320
heterogeneous machines that you may have

104
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,240
in your organization

105
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,840
all in all

106
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,800
you have on an average

107
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,759
as the start shows 15 000 which is a

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,759
very large number of unique

109
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,680
vulnerabilities

110
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,040
so how is an it professional or a team

111
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,720
of security uh i.t professionals

112
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,800
able to triage these vulnerabilities

113
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,759
when you have maybe 40 to 50 new

114
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,639
vulnerabilities coming every day and

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,240
multiply that as i mentioned by the

116
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
number of viruses number of worms and

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,320
number of devices in your organization

118
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,000
so this chart and as i mentioned this uh

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,720
project was inspired by

120
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,560
our tsunami tracking center which is uh

121
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,120
noaa national weather service u.s

122
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
tsunami warning center

123
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,919
and this

124
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,280
slide that you see is that of it's it's

125
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,960
a real-time

126
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,440
it's a real-time

127
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,479
chart

128
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,360
of

129
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,160
how many tsunamis are currently being

130
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,039
tracked by our tsunami tracking system

131
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,360
on the left hand side is the map and on

132
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,600
the right hand side are even

133
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,639
small

134
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,240
tsunamis

135
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,360
or

136
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,320
that that are currently being tracked

137
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,440
and we wanted something similar

138
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,240
so let's uh before going to

139
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,479
vulnerabilities let's quickly take a

140
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,520
look at some of the tsunami facts

141
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,960
how they occur and how our tsunami

142
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,560
tracking system the u.s tsunamis

143
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,880
tracking system is able to give us

144
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
so much accurate information on them

145
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
so essentially tsunamis are caused by

146
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,880
earthquakes earthquakes landslides

147
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,360
volcanic eruptions and things like that

148
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,080
but the main thing to note is that

149
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,440
these events cannot be predicted

150
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,639
but we still have a

151
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,680
fully operational tsunami warning center

152
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
so this can be compared with

153
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,880
vulnerabilities attacks and threats

154
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,560
today as i speak right now i

155
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,680
generally don't have much

156
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,240
much idea on what vulnerabilities will

157
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,720
come out tomorrow what patches will come

158
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,319
out tomorrow what attacks will come out

159
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,280
tomorrow then how can i predict

160
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
what would be the most high profile

161
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,319
vulnerabilities that are coming towards

162
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,039
me

163
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,800
well let's find out

164
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,160
so this is a typical dart system which

165
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,960
is a deep ocean assessment and reporting

166
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,919
system uh used by the tsunami tracking

167
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,800
center

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,599
it's made of three main components there

169
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,080
are these sensors that are glued or

170
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,800
sort of attached to the ocean floor they

171
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,319
are held down by

172
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,319
a bunch of anchors

173
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,120
what these sensors do is they

174
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,639
record even minor tremors earthquakes

175
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,479
volcanic eruptions things like that

176
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,919
things that

177
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,680
have the potential to cause a tsunami

178
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,759
these uh and there are

179
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,479
many such sensors

180
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,400
at the ocean floor

181
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,800
these sensors talk to the surface buoys

182
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,039
through various communication uh

183
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,520
mechanisms there is uh acoustic

184
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,560
telemetry that's that's the most common

185
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,120
but they talk with these surface buoys

186
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,800
and constantly give out data on what

187
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,919
earthquakes small or large and

188
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,840
such activities are happening at the

189
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,680
ocean floor

190
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,960
the surface buoys what they do is they

191
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,759
collect data from these

192
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,759
small sensors which are distributed

193
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,160
across the ocean floor and the surface

194
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,360
buoys have the necessary power to

195
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,599
communicate with the satellite the

196
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,759
sensors obviously they are not that high

197
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,680
powered they cannot directly connect to

198
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,080
the satellite so the surface buoys take

199
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,400
sensor data sensory data from the ocean

200
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,160
floor from many of these sensors

201
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,479
communicate that with the satellite

202
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,800
which has a bi-directional communication

203
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,320
link to the

204
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,839
command and controls and

205
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,320
surface buoys also gather information on

206
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,719
various other things like

207
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,399
how fast the wind is blowing on the

208
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,040
surface and how how big the surface and

209
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,080
whatnot

210
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,959
at the

211
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,440
and so this is an example of one of the

212
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,880
dart surface buoys

213
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,959
add the

214
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,000
command and control there the data is

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,959
compiled and a lot of algorithms applied

216
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,080
to this data based on various well now

217
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,640
we call it ml and ai but

218
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,560
various algorithms

219
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,440
and that helps the

220
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,680
our tsunami tracking center

221
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,519
to communicate

222
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,080
only the high priority

223
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,920
tsunamis and sort of weed out all the

224
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,800
low

225
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,839
noise or the data that does not need to

226
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,200
be processed

227
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,600
so essentially this is similar to the

228
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,920
problem that uh we have in the

229
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,839
vulnerability land there are

230
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,880
like

231
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,200
15 000 vulnerabilities unique

232
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,920
vulnerabilities coming out

233
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,399
we need to we need an automated system

234
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,279
that can weed out all the noise give us

235
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,240
real-time alerts only on the most

236
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,080
prevalent the most seismic

237
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
vulnerabilities

238
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,880
so can principles from tsunami warning

239
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,920
system be applied for cyber attacks

240
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,720
well let's find out the root cause for

241
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,200
tsunamis are earthquakes which cannot be

242
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,000
predicted the root cause for

243
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,320
cyber attacks or wellness is our

244
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,079
vulnerabilities those cannot be

245
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,000
predicted either

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,640
but still real-time alerting is possible

247
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,760
for tsunamis based on the three

248
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
different uh

249
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,640
parts of the system that we saw the data

250
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,399
collection buoys the data point

251
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,959
collection buoys communication and

252
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,399
analytics

253
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,200
so

254
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,120
let's find out if these three principles

255
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,760
can be applied to vulnerabilities to get

256
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,279
a tsunami-like vulnerability alerting

257
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,760
and prioritization system that can do

258
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,079
this automatically and in real time

259
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,040
so

260
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,120
what do we need for this real-time

261
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,360
alerting and prioritization

262
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,079
we need data collection

263
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,200
if you

264
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,440
we just talked about a lot of sensors

265
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,399
that are

266
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,920
at the bottom of the ocean floor

267
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,640
similarly we need a lot of sensors to

268
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,200
collect data on vulnerabilities

269
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,720
we need communication to get the data in

270
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,519
and then a lot of analytics

271
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,720
to

272
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,480
read out all the noise and only

273
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,160
give away high profile vulnerabilities

274
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,440
so we took

275
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
various different approaches

276
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
we were initially thinking about honey

277
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,480
pots

278
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,320
now most of you know what a honey pot is

279
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,959
a honey pot is a device which is

280
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,079
intentionally vulnerable so that you

281
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,720
have these devices exposed on the

282
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,040
internet at various locations you have a

283
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
couple of devices in the u.s couple of

284
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,800
devices in the uk

285
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,360
eu asia so on and so forth and then

286
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
since you have these vulnerable devices

287
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,560
you wait and you see who attacks you

288
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,600
and what a honeypot has is it has

289
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,360
mechanism to

290
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,680
record all these attacks

291
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,560
and let you know in

292
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,480
not real really real time but sort of

293
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,720
almost real time

294
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,800
on what attacks are happening which can

295
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,519
give you information on what's happening

296
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,360
all over the world

297
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,600
we did not take this approach

298
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,279
one because

299
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,680
and nothing against honey pots here but

300
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,680
this gives you a post exploitation view

301
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,480
so for a honeypot to work correctly by

302
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,120
definition the vulnerability has to be

303
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,240
out the

304
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,320
information on how to exploit that

305
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,399
vulnerability has to be out

306
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,360
there has to be malicious actors ex

307
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,680
actively exploiting that vulnerability

308
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,920
and there have to be automated

309
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,000
malicious scanners that have already

310
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,560
been written that would compromise you

311
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,760
so honeypots are great they have great

312
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,480
utility and we use them for other

313
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,680
purposes

314
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,240
but for this purpose we decided not to

315
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,120
go with honey pots mostly because

316
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,399
that

317
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,200
what you get it's post exploitation by

318
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,279
the time you get the data

319
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,519
everyone knows that this is a big deal

320
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,680
and you you may have been already

321
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,519
compromised

322
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,360
the second way which is

323
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,519
other extreme of honeybots is manual

324
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,720
tracking analysis reverse engineering

325
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,639
now this technique is also good and we

326
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,560
do it

327
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,399
at different places on different

328
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,560
occasions but again what we wanted was

329
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,880
more of an automated system

330
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,519
this technique consists of getting

331
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,800
malware samples samples uh and and then

332
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
essentially reversing those samples

333
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,839
opening up those malware samples in

334
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,079
reverse engineering tools and then

335
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,320
studying what the malware is trying to

336
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,199
do

337
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,600
and getting more information about that

338
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,399
particular virus or worm or malware or

339
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,680
things like that

340
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,399
again this is a great technique but we

341
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,920
thought it's it it's not very applicable

342
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,959
to what we were trying to do

343
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,959
so finally what we decided was we

344
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,079
decided to go to the open source open

345
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,279
source route

346
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,040
we decided to

347
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,320
use public data

348
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,519
to collect information so our sensors

349
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,800
were essentially public data on attacks

350
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,680
on exploits on data leaks on

351
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,000
vulnerabilities

352
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,760
we also

353
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,880
made use of various vulnerability feeds

354
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,720
like your nvd

355
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,240
various exploit feeds which tell you

356
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,519
what

357
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,600
the relationship between a cv and

358
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,959
exploit

359
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,480
we also automatically

360
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,720
wrote sensors to collect data from

361
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,880
various blogs and posts and even

362
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,360
linkedin and twitter and things like

363
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,399
that

364
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,600
so for the sake of this project for

365
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,560
real-time vulnerability analysis

366
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,000
and prioritization we made use of all

367
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,639
these public data sources

368
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,199
so the technology that we used was

369
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,040
pretty simple i mean this is just

370
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,360
something that we used and

371
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,639
i think

372
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,920
one can use any similar technology

373
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,320
and it doesn't necessarily have to be

374
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,519
this for our purposes we used amazon aws

375
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,040
we had

376
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,839
lambda functions for our sensors for

377
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,639
data collection so we had one lambda

378
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,800
function to collect for example data

379
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,480
from

380
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,040
nvd we had another lambda function to

381
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,839
for example to collect data from blogs

382
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,839
we had another lambda function to

383
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,240
collect data from twitter

384
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,839
so we had

385
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,480
various different serverless lambda

386
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,399
functions that acted as our

387
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,639
data collection data points data

388
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,800
collection points

389
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,480
we used

390
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,040
we were thinking about nosql database

391
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,839
but at that time

392
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,519
we're most familiar with a certain

393
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,320
variety of database we used that

394
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,279
also

395
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,320
the data that we were

396
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,639
looking at was

397
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,160
not typically the ml and ai type of data

398
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,440
that

399
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,800
most people are

400
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,720
used to these days and i'll talk about

401
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,399
that later

402
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,959
and again for a data analysis we used

403
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,720
various lambda functions that got

404
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,000
triggered on data on completion of data

405
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,519
collection

406
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,279
so the

407
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,399
so the

408
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,880
design looked something like this on

409
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,040
your left hand side there are these

410
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,079
various data collection lambdas each

411
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,079
lambda function in aws collected data on

412
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,360
as i mentioned exploits blogs feeds

413
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,560
twitter

414
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,920
whatnot

415
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,959
we got all that data into a database

416
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,240
and then once this data was completed we

417
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,359
had an our analytic analytics running to

418
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,000
give us real-time prioritization and

419
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,679
alerts

420
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,559
now

421
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,039
this analytics engine was

422
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,039
i think the heart of

423
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,480
this project

424
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,119
the way it worked was we had weights

425
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,079
assigned to a lot of

426
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,839
lambda functions and the data coming

427
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,840
through these lambda functions

428
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,360
so essentially

429
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,400
uh for something for for a data source

430
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,360
like nvd or miter

431
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,559
the weight assigned was very less or

432
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,520
almost zero and that's because you are

433
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,559
expecting to find all vulnerabilities on

434
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,160
nvd or mitre and

435
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,520
similar vulnerability tracking sites

436
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,559
so the weight for that was very less

437
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,000
the weight for

438
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,320
data collected from things like uh

439
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,840
exploits where

440
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,240
you get information on exploits uh and

441
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,200
various exploit feed the weightage was a

442
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,480
little higher

443
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,520
the weightage given and and similarly we

444
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,160
essentially fine-tuned the weight that

445
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,840
was given to

446
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,400
blogs bulletin boards

447
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,240
twitter feeds and

448
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,240
a lot of these data collection lambdas

449
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,880
the analytics function was a pretty

450
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,240
simple uh analytics uh function uh and a

451
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,559
mathematical formula to calculate

452
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,600
weights

453
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,520
and then come up

454
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,200
with a score for each vulnerability or

455
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,720
each cve

456
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,960
so on the left what you have is you have

457
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,120
your data collection lambda functions

458
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,600
going into the analytics engine and a

459
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,320
simple weight based mechanism to

460
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,480
calculate the

461
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,640
to calculate the weight of every

462
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,760
vulnerability or every cve that we get

463
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,480
and that created our real-time

464
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,280
alerts and private

465
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,960
so let's take a look on how it works

466
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,360
so this is a chart

467
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,559
for

468
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,280
the first month of data that we

469
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,160
collected we started this about two

470
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,320
years ago i remember it was around

471
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
christmas of 2017.

472
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,280
we had our project almost done

473
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,000
we we let it run for about a month

474
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,360
which was in december of 2017

475
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,480
um

476
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,640
we went for holidays and when we came

477
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,280
back in january and started analyzing

478
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,039
the data this is what we got

479
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,400
on the x-axis you have the vulnerability

480
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,880
intelligence quotient so these are

481
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,480
these are essentially the this is

482
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
essentially the weight that is

483
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,960
calculated by the analytics engine for

484
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,720
each vulnerability

485
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,679
and on the y-axis what you have is a

486
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,880
timeline

487
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,520
and as you can see here the timeline is

488
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,720
just for one month this was just like

489
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,360
almost like a test that we did

490
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,559
and see

491
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,520
what happens with one month of data

492
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,000
so we got a lot of data

493
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,559
but we saw some outliers

494
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,720
so the one on the top

495
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,000
at the very top is was for a cve in the

496
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,640
microsoft malware production engine

497
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,480
and it was a remote code execution

498
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,360
vulnerability which actually

499
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,240
attackers can use to

500
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,320
take control of your machine

501
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,159
with the help of the malware production

502
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,240
engine which is uh essentially supposed

503
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,640
to protect you so we said okay that's

504
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,039
good that seems like a high

505
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,440
profile vulnerability and our

506
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,400
system

507
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,320
based on the output of our system it

508
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,960
does it is on on the top

509
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,600
the second vulnerability here in our

510
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,039
example was a palo alto network's panos

511
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,919
remote code execution vulnerability

512
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,960
again same thing uh attacker could use

513
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,480
the

514
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,799
remote code the remote management

515
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,600
interface for to

516
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,919
to perform remote code execution

517
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,760
again we thought that yeah it is a

518
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,919
pretty high profile vulnerability

519
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,440
we went through a lot of other

520
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,240
vulnerabilities in there manually to

521
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,039
make sure that what our the results from

522
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,600
our system are good that it

523
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,159
that generally syste this is the

524
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,799
vulnerabilities that our researchers

525
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,760
thought

526
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,000
were high profile are being ranked

527
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
correctly as high profile by this

528
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,840
automated system

529
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,360
so we said okay that's a great start

530
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,080
and decided to

531
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,280
just keep the system running so this is

532
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,039
essentially the

533
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,280
these are the various characteristics of

534
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,720
the apollo alto vulnerability or cve

535
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,120
what you have here is uh this is a

536
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,919
screenshot from nvd and what you have

537
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,000
here is the cvs

538
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,080
score for that vulnerability the cbs

539
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,760
score was 9.8

540
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,679
and as you can see the

541
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,400
attack vector was network which is bad

542
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,799
complex attack complexity was low which

543
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,200
is also bad privilege required was none

544
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,520
user interaction none

545
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,320
so on and so forth and we all again our

546
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,159
researchers went through this manually

547
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,600
to make sure that

548
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,799
uh

549
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,840
there is no there is

550
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,559
no bug in this

551
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,400
but what we saw about five days later

552
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,200
which is just in the second month of the

553
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,200
system being online is a massive massive

554
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,760
jump in the vulnerability intelligence

555
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,799
quotient for about two vulnerabilities

556
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,360
so as i mentioned on the

557
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,880
y-axis you have days so this chart is

558
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,520
plotted per day

559
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,840
and on the x-axis is the vulnerability

560
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840
intelligence quotient initially we

561
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,520
thought that something went wrong in the

562
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,840
system because for the last month and

563
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,240
month and a half we had vulnerabilities

564
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,840
with their intelligence quotient with

565
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
500 600

566
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,760
800 something like that

567
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,280
and on

568
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,159
around uh if i'm if i remember correctly

569
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,840
5th of january in 2018 we had

570
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,799
a few vulnerabilities with their weight

571
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,159
or intelligent

572
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,039
quotient more than 2 500 almost

573
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,720
approaching 3 000.

574
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,520
can you guess what vulnerabilities these

575
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,280
were

576
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,039
well if you if you guessed uh meltdown

577
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,000
and spectre then you are right because

578
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,720
these were if you remember the high

579
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,000
profile

580
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,080
meltdown and spectral vulnerabilities

581
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,159
that affected

582
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,760
a lot of um

583
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,360
microprocessors

584
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,320
and

585
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,159
there were a lot of side channel based

586
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,799
attack vulnerabilities where essentially

587
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,200
a process can

588
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,960
look or can

589
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,679
view data into another process and also

590
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,080
cause remote execution

591
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,240
so these vulnerabilities i think most of

592
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,320
us here have been around for like a few

593
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
years and can still remember

594
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,880
the the huge huge impact that these

595
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,120
vulnerabilities had on

596
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,240
on almost in the entire ecosystem on

597
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,080
almost all of us

598
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,159
desktop systems were affected servers

599
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,400
were affected

600
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,039
laptops were affected these two meltdown

601
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,520
and spectral vulnerabilities affected

602
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,400
all

603
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,159
almost all home

604
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,559
almost all hardware

605
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,520
so

606
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,840
uh we were really again happy to see

607
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,640
that uh our vulnerability alerting

608
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,720
system really gave

609
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,679
melt melt down and specter a

610
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,640
intelligence quotient of more than 2

611
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,960
500 and that was as you can see from the

612
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,240
graph a very high number as compared to

613
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,559
what it had given before

614
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,360
now you can you see two arrows pointing

615
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,760
to two dots there that's because

616
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,799
uh these vulnerabilities were ranked uh

617
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,440
higher for multiple days and the chart

618
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,559
is drawn

619
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,240
every day

620
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,720
so um

621
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
a little bit information on meltdown

622
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,960
inspector

623
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,760
but soon we realized that the system

624
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,400
seems to be working but we cannot

625
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,480
communicate the weight or the

626
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,039
vulnerability intelligence quotient in

627
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,279
numbers like the quotient for meltdown

628
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,880
is two thousand seven hundred two

629
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,559
thousand seven hundred watt

630
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,559
that's obviously it was not

631
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,720
uh self-explanatory

632
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,960
so we decided to have a system that

633
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,880
would divide these numbers or these

634
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,120
intelligence quotients into

635
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,919
various different threat levels which

636
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,279
a normal

637
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,679
practitioner can understand easily and

638
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,279
quickly low elevated high critical

639
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,480
we went with

640
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,000
these four

641
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,400
the way these were calculated was and

642
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,600
again uh we were calculating in a

643
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,760
particular way before now we are doing

644
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,840
it differently and i'll talk about that

645
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,919
as well

646
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,559
but initially it was a simple

647
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,240
ratio and once you

648
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,559
put your vulnerability intelligence

649
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,440
quotient in it this is what the

650
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,919
what it came out with

651
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,600
so so far we we had only two

652
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,720
vulnerabilities with critical uh raiding

653
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,600
and like a few with medium and then low

654
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,440
and so on and so forth

655
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,039
this was something that we knew from the

656
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,600
get go we may need to

657
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
change the formula to

658
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,159
essentially divide these intelligence

659
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,480
quotients into high medium low and

660
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,960
critical

661
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,960
but still for the first month when we

662
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,400
did some analysis

663
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,799
of the data like essentially compared

664
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,240
our alerts with cvss we found this

665
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,720
now again cvss as you know is the common

666
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,880
vulnerability scoring system

667
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,679
and it is amazing it has helped the

668
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,559
it has helped organizations for the last

669
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,799
20 years enormously

670
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,760
and we internally also use cbs's for

671
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,559
various things but one of the things

672
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,080
that

673
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,799
at least for this purpose cbss is not

674
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,360
useful about is that a lot of

675
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,799
vulnerabilities get too high operating

676
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,399
and that's because

677
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,960
it only considers the fundamental

678
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
characteristics of the vulnerabilities

679
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,880
the cbs's base score

680
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,279
and does not consider characteristics

681
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,279
like if it has been exploited in the

682
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,080
wild or how many instances are there in

683
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,720
the while and so on and so forth

684
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,960
and that makes it really difficult to

685
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,000
use cvss as a prioritization mechanism

686
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,760
if if you can see in the first month of

687
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,240
data on the left hand side we have cvss

688
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,799
and there we had 96 vulnerabilities

689
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,440
which were the highest which are the

690
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,399
highest criticality between nine and ten

691
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,360
while our system here on the right had

692
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,520
only four alerts which were for two

693
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,080
vulnerabilities meltdown inspector only

694
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,520
six alerts for

695
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,399
high vulnerabilities and only 20 alerts

696
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,960
for elevated vulnerabilities

697
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,600
most of the time we

698
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,799
low is

699
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,000
vulnerabilities that have really low

700
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,559
severity and most of the time it's even

701
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,360
i mean you could for all

702
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,840
practical purposes

703
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,559
purpose of prioritization to find out

704
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,720
what's the most critical vulnerability

705
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,399
ignore this

706
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,799
so going on this was our one-year data

707
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,799
again same thing

708
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,600
y-axis has time x-axis has intelligence

709
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,080
quotient this is internal data

710
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,200
and

711
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,880
on on on the left side in december in

712
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,279
january of 2018

713
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,480
december of 2017 you can see this 2500

714
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,120
to 3 000 these were the two spectra and

715
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,919
the meltdown vulnerabilities that we saw

716
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,080
throughout the year there were a few

717
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,960
vulnerabilities but none of them touched

718
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,760
the vulnerability intelligence quotient

719
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,440
that was generated by

720
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,360
spectre and meltdown

721
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,200
so we almost thought that this was like

722
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,440
only a one-time thing where

723
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,760
vulnerability like spectre or meltdown

724
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,039
comes out

725
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,760
and do we really need to adjust our

726
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,960
formula for rating these vulnerabilities

727
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,320
into these red

728
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,879
orange yellow and green zones

729
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,520
but what happened almost uh

730
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,080
at the end of 2018 was we did get two

731
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,919
really high profile vulnerabilities two

732
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,200
or actually four high-profile

733
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,960
vulnerabilities that almost did go to

734
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,919
the level of severity of a meltdown

735
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,200
inspector

736
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,440
one of his was the lib ssh

737
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,360
authentication bypass

738
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,880
and many of you may remember this is

739
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,679
uh um this was the ssh vulnerability

740
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,480
where you attackers could connect to ssh

741
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,440
server without providing any credentials

742
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,760
so for any linux users this was almost

743
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,799
like a very devastating vulnerability

744
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,480
if your server is configured in a

745
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,559
certain configuration and so on and so

746
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,799
forth so there are certain nuances and

747
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,159
details that you have to look at it

748
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,039
and the second vulnerability that again

749
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,200
got a higher intelligence quotient which

750
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,840
was able to crack and go into that

751
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,880
critical vulnerability bucket was the

752
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,159
apple mac os

753
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,480
kernel crash vulnerability which was

754
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,320
icmp packet handling vulnerability

755
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,559
icmp as you know

756
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,360
is a protocol where you can

757
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,360
we don't you don't need to authenticate

758
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,519
it's not tcp based

759
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,279
either you can just send icmp packets to

760
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,480
the mac os or ios kernel to essentially

761
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
crash the device

762
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,519
so

763
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,559
there were vulnerabilities uh that that

764
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,519
cracked the critical

765
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,399
criteria and we were pretty excited to

766
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,399
see that our our formula to

767
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,799
to distribute this vulnerability

768
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,799
intelligence quotient into high medium

769
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,679
low

770
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,360
and critical that what that was still

771
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,279
holding true

772
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,399
so after one year what we saw was

773
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,360
i mean what we had set out was to get

774
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,279
real-time vulnerability alerts and as

775
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,360
you can see we get

776
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,279
vulnerability alerts daily that is

777
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,559
because our sensors collected data daily

778
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,760
gave it to the analytics engine and

779
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,399
reports were generated daily

780
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,120
but also what you can see is that

781
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,240
during the same time period there were

782
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,360
about

783
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,640
500 vulnerabilities that cvs has ranked

784
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,720
as uh

785
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,120
with the highest criticality cbs's

786
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,000
criticalities go from 0 to 10 and there

787
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,720
were 1 500 unique vulnerabilities that

788
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,840
were ranked nine to ten

789
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
as you know uh

790
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,720
triaging these uh

791
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,880
thousand five hundred vulnerabilities

792
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,320
times uh the number of malware that is

793
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,039
uses them to exploit times the number of

794
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,519
machines that you have gets the numbers

795
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,080
become quick very fast

796
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
while in our system what we had for the

797
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,480
same time period was only nine

798
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,840
vulnerabilities were marked as critical

799
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,000
35 were marked as high and 184 were

800
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,760
marked as elevated

801
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,840
so as far as prioritization

802
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,559
is concerned i think uh

803
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,760
i mean we were pretty happy with the

804
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,000
results that we got

805
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,919
moving along

806
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,360
um

807
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,080
i i talked about um

808
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,640
basically to fine-tuning the algorithm

809
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,760
for

810
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,640
uh

811
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,799
for dividing these vulnerabilities into

812
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,039
low high medium and critical

813
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,720
again in this chart if you observe

814
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,559
closely on the left hand side you would

815
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,159
still see these straight dots which

816
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,159
correspond to

817
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,279
spectre and meltdown then almost in the

818
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,799
center of the chart you see some

819
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,720
vulnerabilities that we just saw the

820
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,080
apple ios and the ssh vulnerability

821
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,519
and

822
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,720
in mid 2019 we again got a pretty big

823
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,519
spike of vulnerabilities that we're able

824
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,159
to crack into the critical

825
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,960
section these were the microsoft blue

826
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
keep rdp remote code execution

827
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,919
vulnerability and the whatsapp

828
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,799
remote code execution issue

829
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,880
as you may remember for blue keep

830
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,159
microsoft mentioned that their telemetry

831
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,080
showed that there were about

832
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,559
400 000 endpoints on the internet that

833
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,120
their telemetry found where

834
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,120
were open or very susceptible to these

835
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,520
vulnerabilities so it had a potential to

836
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,359
be the next

837
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,239
wannacry or such vulnerabilities which

838
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,119
had

839
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,520
millions of dollars

840
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,839
attached to it because of exploitation

841
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,000
so

842
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,599
what we thought was instead of having

843
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,440
what we thought was making this

844
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,719
alerting mechanism or this

845
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,560
classification mechanism a little bit

846
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,320
more dynamic

847
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,040
and the way it behaves now is that it

848
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,639
takes uh it it stamps the

849
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,320
vulnerabilities with high low medium

850
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,440
critical

851
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,960
but the

852
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,199
the numbers change so as you can see

853
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,399
here

854
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,320
the microsoft blue key

855
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
remote code execution vulnerability has

856
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,079
the internal threat intelligence

857
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,640
quotient of

858
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,720
about

859
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,440
3700 which was a lot more than the

860
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,160
spectre or meltdown

861
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,160
but also

862
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,359
spectre and meltdown affected everyone

863
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,680
different operating systems

864
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,280
windows linux

865
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,599
various different devices

866
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,280
whereas the blue keep although it

867
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,000
affected 400 000 devices on the internet

868
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,280
it was a microsoft rdp remote code

869
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,880
execution vulnerability not a

870
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,800
hardware-based vulnerability

871
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,920
so what we concluded was that now not

872
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,760
that already blue keep was any more

873
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,920
critical than spectre or

874
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,839
spectre was any less critical than blue

875
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,920
keep but this was attributed just that

876
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,640
there is a lot more data being collected

877
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,440
by our sensors now and that is a direct

878
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,000
result of a lot of

879
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,160
a lot more data being generated for

880
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,000
these vulnerabilities

881
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,920
so we realized that we need sort of

882
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,040
a sliding scale and algorithm that would

883
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,000
slowly change slowly change

884
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,960
as we collect more and more data i'm

885
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,280
sure one year from now as we are

886
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,960
collecting more and more data and more

887
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,839
and more open source data is available

888
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,440
uh there would be a lot more

889
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,119
vulnerabilities that would fall into the

890
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,280
origin or critical section

891
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,920
so now we have changed

892
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,800
change the algorithm to

893
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,320
compensate that

894
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,720
again a very familiar chart comparison

895
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,960
between cvss and

896
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,240
our data

897
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,599
if

898
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,119
if you look at cbss there where

899
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,119
again thousands of alerts uh while

900
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,960
as compared to the system that we build

901
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,200
there were only 15 alerts it is a lot

902
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,880
more easier to

903
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,720
respond to 15 or 54 high prof uh profile

904
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,000
alerts as compared to responding to

905
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,160
thousands and thousands of alerts

906
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,280
so this is the last chart about data

907
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,839
this is all the data that we have from

908
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:10,800
about

909
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,720
two and a half years

910
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,400
as you can see again on the left hand

911
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,560
side you still see spectra and meltdown

912
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,040
but they are now they look a little bit

913
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,960
short or tiny

914
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,400
as compared

915
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,440
to the data that we are collecting now

916
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,440
this is what happens when uh we

917
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,359
sort of

918
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,960
distribute the data between higher

919
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,880
medium low and critical

920
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,359
the highest that we have so far is the

921
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,880
nsa

922
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,240
curveball vulnerability and

923
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,880
i i'm sure most of you still

924
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,960
have uh

925
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,760
have injuries from that well

926
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,760
that curveball

927
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,079
as you know this vulnerability was a

928
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,280
curveball because it was a vulnerability

929
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,760
in the pki infrastructure in the

930
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,160
elliptical curve and that's why the name

931
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,800
curveball in the elliptical core of

932
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,440
algorithm that is used to sign

933
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,119
certificates essentially what

934
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,359
what happened was that and what could

935
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,440
have happened or what the vulnerability

936
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,640
was that an attacker could design

937
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,680
files

938
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,119
sign website certificates so that any

939
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,240
malicious website could also be reported

940
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,800
to the browser or to you as a trusted

941
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,560
website

942
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,799
and

943
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,240
this vulnerable

944
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,680
in in the words of neil who is

945
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,720
who is technical director of nacs nsc

946
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
cyber security this kind of

947
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,040
vulnerability may shake our belief in

948
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,520
the strength of cryptography

949
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,680
cryptographic authentication mechanisms

950
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,320
and make us question if we really can

951
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,280
rely on them fortunately we can so he

952
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,560
had to come out and sort of uh give a

953
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,280
word of confidence that there is no

954
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,240
uh

955
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,240
no deficiency in the cryptographic

956
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,560
algorithms it's essentially a weakness

957
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,119
in the implementation and then blah blah

958
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,599
blah there were um there was a lot of

959
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,359
explanation about this vulnerability

960
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,240
where

961
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,320
uh if it

962
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,400
if a certain type of elliptical curve is

963
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,079
used in generation of the certificates

964
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,560
then one can create a spoof certificate

965
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,320
which

966
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,119
when validated can can essentially pass

967
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,800
validation

968
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,680
so

969
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,280
overall

970
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,800
as you can see now

971
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,480
the

972
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,079
nsa

973
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,079
curveball vulnerability falls into

974
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,400
critical it has a lot higher

975
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,320
vulnerability intelligence quotient as

976
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,280
compared to melt down inspector

977
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,760
but we have not changed the

978
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,079
criticality on meltdown inspector even

979
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,720
though by today's standard

980
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,280
by today's standard meltdown inspector

981
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,240
would be

982
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,119
not critical in our algorithm they are

983
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,280
as you can see they are falling into the

984
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,240
orange or the second

985
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,119
second high category

986
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,920
but what we decided was once we stamp a

987
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,240
vulnerability we as high critical medium

988
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,720
low these vulnerabilities are stamped at

989
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,760
such based on the standard on which they

990
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,800
were

991
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,280
reported by the alerting system

992
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,599
so we will still keep meltdown inspector

993
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,240
as critical but going forward as this

994
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,960
algorithm changes

995
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,040
as more and more to compensate

996
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,880
because we have more and more data being

997
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,680
collected constantly

998
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,380
so overall takeaways if you

999
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,760
[Music]

1000
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
if you need like only one slide to take

1001
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,359
home from this session that would be

1002
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,240
this

1003
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,640
which is the list of top 10

1004
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,119
vulnerabilities in the last two two and

1005
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,400
a half years

1006
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,760
that our real-time vulnerability system

1007
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,599
was able to identify prioritize and

1008
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,720
generate

1009
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,440
alerts on

1010
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,520
there are various vulnerabilities here

1011
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,839
i'm not going to go over each of them

1012
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,319
and some of them we already talked about

1013
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,240
in

1014
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,560
during this session

1015
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,440
so

1016
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,599
so where are we and where are we

1017
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,720
going what

1018
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,560
where are we going to take this project

1019
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,839
how can you get your hands on this data

1020
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,680
and on these alerts and on um

1021
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,079
on on on this vulnerability

1022
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,920
prioritization scheme

1023
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,680
so one of the first thing that we are

1024
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,319
doing right now is uh

1025
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,119
is implementing a system which would

1026
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,400
allow you to have a free access

1027
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,800
community to the entire community to

1028
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,839
have free access to data as well as to

1029
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,640
the alerts that it generates so that's

1030
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,359
the first priority of the current work

1031
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,800
that is happening

1032
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,960
in the future we also plan to do

1033
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,520
different type of trendings as in

1034
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,319
we

1035
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,880
are thinking about classification

1036
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,400
different types of classification so

1037
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,040
that you could set filters that i only

1038
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,160
want to be

1039
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,760
alerted on web application

1040
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,319
vulnerabilities or cloud vulnerability

1041
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,319
server vulnerabilities or appliance

1042
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,319
vulnerabilities so on and so forth so

1043
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,200
these this classification would allow

1044
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,280
users to get one of the top

1045
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,119
vulnerabilities only from their domain

1046
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,440
uh the second thing that we are looking

1047
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,319
at is uh having

1048
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,119
attack and exploit classification so

1049
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,599
adding more information to see how we

1050
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,480
can attach ransomware data targeted

1051
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,560
attacks data malware data to these

1052
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,200
vulnerabilities to again

1053
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,560
future expose and enrich the experience

1054
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,079
that

1055
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,079
that one would have

1056
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,960
as well as last but not least is the

1057
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,480
root cause classification to classify

1058
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,720
what was what is the root cause for all

1059
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,800
these vulnerabilities

1060
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,640
lastly we are also

1061
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,800
trying to apply various

1062
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,200
ml and ai type of

1063
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,359
algorithms and different type of data

1064
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,520
collection

1065
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,560
which is more suited for machine

1066
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,480
learning

1067
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
it could be that

1068
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,280
nowadays you have algorithms that can

1069
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,480
read blogs give blogs give you

1070
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,960
information on what the blog is about

1071
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,319
and if it is

1072
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,520
in

1073
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,440
it is a positive blog or it's a negative

1074
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,480
blog

1075
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,960
so more sort of automation

1076
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,400
of public data

1077
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,760
all right so

1078
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,200
all in all that's uh the real time

1079
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
vulnerability tracking and

1080
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,720
prioritization

1081
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,960
system that we developed if you have any

1082
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,400
questions please feel free to reach out

1083
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,359
to me

1084
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,480
my twitter handle is here

1085
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,839
on the screen

1086
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,480
and i hope you enjoyed the session thank

1087
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,040
you
