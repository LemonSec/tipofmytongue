17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,920
manage them and how covet 19 has

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
accelerated the conversation about

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,920
web-based voting

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,079

also joining us is mr matt masterson who

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,199
is a senior cyber security advisor at

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,920
the department of homeland security

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,960
also joining us is mr bryson board who

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,280

security company scythe

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,960
welcome to our distinguished panel

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,720
so let's get started

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,040
the united states 2020 presidential

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
election will occur soon and over 100

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
million americans will vote using a

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,560
variety of methods with or without an

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
auditable trail

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,560
the pandemic is causing part of that

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,720
electorate to cast boats using different

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,240
forms that they may not have

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,040
traditionally used and americans have

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,840
questions about the security of that

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,520
process so today's panel of election

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,079
security experts will answer several of

43
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,680
those questions

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,920
for example we're going to talk about

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
how did bad actors try to affect the

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,200
2016 election and what lessons have we

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,799
learned from that that we're applying in

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,399
2020

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,799
we'll also discuss what are the security

50
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,200
issues that exist in traditional voting

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,799
systems that will be used in 2020

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,240
we'll also discuss the key

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,080
responsibilities of the federal and

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,120
state governments in election security

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,720
we'll discuss some of the security

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,360
issues that exist with the new mobile

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
voting platforms and how they can be

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,560
addressed

59
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,800
and finally we'll discuss what can be

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
done to instill confidence in the

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,200
election process in 2020 i'd like to

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
start with a question about what we've

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,599
learned from past experiences

64
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,200
i'd like to address this to matt

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,360
masterson can you recap some of the

66
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,599
various ways that bad actors have

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,319
interfered with prior elections

68
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,239
yeah i appreciate the question thank you

69
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,640
so what we know from 2016 is

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,519
uh that in this case the russian uh

71
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,440
government targeted really three buckets

72
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
uh that we think about the first is

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,720
infrastructure targeting we know that

74
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,440
they targeted in a small number of cases

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,400
gained access to uh voter data uh you

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
know for instance uh the illinois state

77
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,840
board of elections voter registration

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,400
data was accessed and taken no evidence

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,319
uh of changing of any records but we

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,599
know that was a point of interest for

81
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,760
them the second uh was targeting of

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,640
campaigns uh and campaign infrastructure

83
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,720
emails and otherwise the famous example

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,200
being uh john podesta's email uh to

85
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,959
either get communication or critical

86
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,640
information from the campaigns and then

87
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,480
there's the disinformation in and around

88
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
both the election process uh and the

89
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,640
campaign and candidates so those are the

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,440
three buckets we know from 2016 but we

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,159
also know uh is one uh that the same

92
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,000
playbook is not likely to be used again

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,760
in 2016 that we're in a different

94
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,159
environment two as evidence from the

95
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,440
recent statement from the director of

96
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,239
national intelligence last week uh there

97
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,120
are more actors that are taking notice

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,000
uh in what happened in 2016 and trying

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,440
to uh engage uh with our elections uh

100
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,080
and at least uh spread disinformation or

101
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,159
doubt about the process and then three

102
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,760
uh we continue to see just through our

103
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
visibility into election networks uh

104
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,080
cyber criminals uh targeting election

105
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,760
infrastructure or at least county and

106
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,439
state government and having an impact on

107
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,280
election infrastructure and so as we

108
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,080
look back at sort of uh 2016 and what's

109
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,560
happened since uh what we've learned uh

110
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,400
is that we can't assume uh the same

111
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,879
playbook uh and that uh we really need

112
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,199
to focus on that result those resilience

113
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,040
measures which enable election officials

114
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,798
not just to protect those systems but

115
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,240
maintain the integrity of the process

116
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,919
and keep it running uh throughout

117
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,840
thank you very much bryson is there

118
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,320
anything you'd like to add to that

119
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,560
yeah so i represent the offensive

120
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,199
security research side aka the hacker

121
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
and the first thing i would i really

122
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,040
like to highlight here is you don't have

123
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,919
to technically compromise a system or a

124
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,400
device to compromise it

125
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,280
particularly when we're looking at

126
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,759
election security it's a question around

127
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,960
public trust and transparency and that

128
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,880
responsibility of showing that trust

129
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,639
that transparency goes all the way from

130
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,560
the different levels of government the

131
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,400
manufacturers

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,840
and everything that's operating the

133
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,479
whole piece of it and so if we look at

134
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,120
elements of what we saw in 2016 the

135
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,800
russians compromised our trust in in

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,360
those elements and the governments all

137
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,880
throughout in the last four years have

138
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,520
done an outstanding job of really rising

139
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,360
to meet that challenge

140
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,520
um i think it's also worth noting that

141
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,199
if we looked at how the campaign

142
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,000
happened over the summer of 2016 there

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,240
was a moment there where the russians

144
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,919
actually got caught

145
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,520
and there was a strategic pause they

146
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
stopped doing what they were doing

147
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,199
and i think it's worth noting that

148
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,000
because that pause was their fear of

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,840
what would happen with being caught and

150
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,080
when nothing happened they continued to

151
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,280
do it again

152
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
since then of course we have seen a much

153
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,000
more robust response at all levels um in

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
2018 and 2020 which is why i would like

155
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,680
to highlight what matt masterson said

156
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,639
about

157
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,919
that

158
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,360
there is going to be something different

159
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
and i think the two things that we've

160
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,800
seen is we talked about criminal groups

161
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
well that ties to

162
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,440
the increase in ransomware that we see

163
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,240
as well as what we see is the rise of

164
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,000
proxy attack groups which is that

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
countries like iran

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,280
and russia

167
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,720
have hired other countries or other

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,479
groups to

169
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,960
actually do the the offensive operations

170
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,600
on their behalf

171
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,639
it makes it harder to trace back

172
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,800
exactly right

173
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,520
uh secretary padilla uh i know there are

174
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,280
lots of lessons learned from those prior

175
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,479
experiences

176
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,240
uh what's being done

177
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,720
in california that's different since

178
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,440
2016 what lessons have you applied

179
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,199
oh where do we begin i mean i think for

180
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,319
starters it's uh keeping matt masterson

181
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,039
on my speed dial in case we hear

182
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,039
or suspect anything we're looping in our

183
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,400
partners uh in real time so that we have

184
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,000
as complete a picture

185
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,800
of a cyber threat uh as possible and

186
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,599
take any necessary action but know using

187
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,319
the 2016 experience as a guide uh and

188
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,080
frankly a little bit of the mueller

189
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,479
reports and the indictments prior to

190
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,919
that as uh

191
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,440
matt mentioned you can kind of

192
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,759
categorize what was happening in 2016 in

193
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,240
a few buckets uh and i'll kind of use

194
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,160
his

195
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,360
buckets

196
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,280
as examples when it comes to the

197
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,800
political campaigns and other

198
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,160
organizations

199
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,520
that involved

200
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,560
in around an election you know our job

201
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,160
on the government side is simply the

202
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
election administration site you know we

203
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,400
don't provide extra support for

204
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,000
political candidates or political

205
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,319
parties but to the extent that there's

206
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,560
incidents there that erodes the public

207
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,520
trust

208
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,840
uh to bryson's point you know we do have

209
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,240
to be concerned about that so i think in

210
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,319
the good news is there's a lot better

211
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,720
awareness today of the threats and some

212
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,360
of the dynamics than there was in 2016

213
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,759
just more broadly uh in all sectors not

214
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,199
just elections

215
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,280
when it comes to our infrastructure i'd

216
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,520
like to think california is leading the

217
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,240
way you know we have established our own

218
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,400
testing and certification requirements

219
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,199
for voting systems in california that

220
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,240
exceed what's recommended by the eac

221
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,479
that most states follow you know things

222
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,560
like requiring paper ballots of course

223
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,440
and keeping your uh machines offline you

224
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,919
know but uh whether it's uh the code the

225
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,199
but that supports uh systems the the

226
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,080
firewall encryption levels etc etc

227
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,680
i think california's on the forefront

228
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,840
because we have

229
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,640
thanks to the governor and the

230
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,200
legislature invested in upgrading or

231
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,919
replacing the voting systems in all 58

232
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,000
counties to newer more secure systems uh

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,399
but i do think the biggest threat or

234
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,760
concern for me today is the

235
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
misinformation and disinformation that

236
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,080
persists out there not just but

237
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,399
especially on social media

238
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,240
i think my personal opinion am i going

239
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,640
to put this on other panelists but the

240
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,399
the lack of sufficient response i'll be

241
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,320
diplomatic at that uh to choose to 2016

242
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,120
uh has served as an invitation uh not

243
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,560
just for agents of the russian

244
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,720
government to continue uh potentially

245
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,519
others and even domestic actors who

246
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,680
uh either get thrills off of creating

247
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,440
that chaos or something doubt in our

248
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,519
elections so it's up the ante for

249
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,839
elections officials uh to correct the

250
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,440
record when we need to

251
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,519
and inform voters of where they should

252
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,399
go for official reliable trustworthy

253
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,080
information on

254
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,399
voter registration or actually voting

255
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,680
and that's of course your county

256
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,279
elections office and the secretary of

257
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,600
state

258
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,399
well

259
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,760
thank you very much

260
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,240
uh mata sounds like the

261
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,160
states are relying very heavily on the

262
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,480
department of homeland security what's

263
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,080
being done differently at the federal

264
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,959
level now versus 2016

265
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,360
yeah absolutely so much and secretary

266
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,560
padilla uh really touched on it but in

267
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,839
2016-2017 we're in an environment uh

268
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,120
where we didn't have the trust of the

269
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,040
states i mean there was literally states

270
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
accusing uh the department of homeland

271
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,399
security of attempting to hack them

272
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,000
right so that's the trust deficit we

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,079
were at uh and so it was incumbent on us

274
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,160
to build a relationship with them and to

275
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,240
meaningfully provide value it's one

276
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,399
thing to talk and engage with state and

277
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,920
local election officials but they demand

278
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,519
more they demand accountability the

279
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,120
demands support services and so that's

280
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,519
where our focus has been uh secretary

281
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,200
padilla mentioned having me on speed

282
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,360
dial it works both ways i know i can

283
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,440
reach out to him or they his colleagues

284
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,000
can reach out to me across all 50 states

285
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,839
we have relationships with all of them

286
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,040
thousands of local election

287
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,279
jurisdictions providing information

288
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,720
providing support and services

289
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,800
everything from pen testing to cyber

290
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,959
hygiene against the incident response

291
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,880
ensuring that they have the information

292
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,480
they need whether it's general risk

293
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,720
information whether it's trend analysis

294
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,160
on what we're seeing out in the field

295
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,640
where election officials can improve or

296
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
whether it's specific technical threat

297
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,240
indicators that's getting out through

298
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,760
our information sharing an analysis

299
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,360
center to them in

300
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,959
timely fashion so that they can defend

301
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,320
their systems and most importantly take

302
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,399
that next step talk to their voters

303
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,000
about the steps they've taken to protect

304
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,839
the systems about the steps they've

305
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,160
taken to manage the risk and ensure

306
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,560
resilience in the elections process uh

307
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,800
because in the end as bryson so

308
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
correctly pointed out

309
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,399
it doesn't take someone actually

310
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,480
accessing the system to raise doubts to

311
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,399
raise concerns and election officials

312
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,480
are the ones best positioned to talk to

313
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,079
their voters directly about everything

314
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,279
they've done and the good work that's

315
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,200
happened uh over the last three years to

316
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,320
protect systems there's still

317
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,920
improvements to be made there's still a

318
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,000
lot to do uh in the lead-up to this

319
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,839
election uh but there's so much that's

320
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,680
gone on the other area i'll highlight is

321
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,720
the level of collaboration and

322
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,839
coordination across the federal

323
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,519
government uh

324
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,720
for dhs cisa for fbi for dod for the

325
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,240
intelligence community as whole this is

326
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,320
a top priority and what we see

327
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,680
is the amount of collaboration the

328
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,800
amount of information sharing the

329
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,079
willingness of the intelligence

330
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,560
community to downgrade classified

331
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,040
information to get it out to state local

332
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,680
officials is is really uh working in

333
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,600
this space and it's a level that i'm

334
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
told by many uh is unlike what they've

335
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,000
seen in other areas of mission i think

336
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,079
we again we could still improve really

337
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,079
getting stuff unclassified completely

338
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,360
and shared broadly not just with

339
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
election officials but the american

340
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,480
public but there's been a lot of good

341
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,639
work uh done there and that support uh

342
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,160
is directly towards our state and local

343
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,639
partners like secretary padilla

344
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,040
it does build a lot of confidence to

345
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,959
know that the uh

346
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,120
at the federal level that

347
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,959
the organizations are

348
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,040
really collaborating with each other

349
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,959
that's so important and it sounds like

350
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,399
there's some excellent information

351
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,000
sharing going on between the federal and

352
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,560
the state levels uh matt you you talked

353
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,680
about the kind of information sharing do

354
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,240
you find that the states are all

355
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
using that type of information sharing

356
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,480
or some using it more than others

357
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,160
yeah i mean each state's postured

358
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,800
differently uh we have gotten great

359
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,320
feedback on what we're pushing i i think

360
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,079
we continue to look for ways to improve

361
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,920
to make it actionable particularly for

362
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,320
your mid to small county level officials

363
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
the reality is we we have our 50 states

364
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,639
and five territories but we have over 8

365
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,320
800 local jurisdictions that run

366
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,600
elections in this country in a state

367
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,480
like wisconsin you have 1800 localities

368
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
responsible for running elections just

369
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,320
in wisconsin and so how do we make this

370
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,399
information digestible and usable so

371
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,959
they can take it and say okay this is

372
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,040
what it means for my systems this is the

373
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,720
steps i need to take and i will tell you

374
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,959
this is the biggest area of focus for us

375
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,120
right now and i know for state officials

376
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,519
how do we get it support down to the

377
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,600
local level those mid to small counties

378
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,760
the majority of which uh uh run

379
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,200
elections in this country not everyone's

380
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
los angeles county right the largest

381
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,320
jurisdiction in this country how do we

382
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,560
help cheryl and jackson county ohio

383
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,240
understand what's being sent to her how

384
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,839
to patch a system how to segment a

385
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,680
network how to implement multi-factor

386
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,839
authentication uh that's the challenge

387
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,839
in front of us still uh to help provide

388
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,279
that support the states are doing really

389
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,360
tremendous work uh many states have

390
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
implemented cyber navigator programs

391
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,399
where they're sending state i.t

392
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,240
officials out into the counties to help

393
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,839
do this kind of assessment uh but

394
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,600
there's a lot more we could be doing and

395
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,519
this has been a big focus for us at

396
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,120
system we've reached over 5000

397
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,399
jurisdictions

398
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,320
with what we call our last mile effort

399
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,160
to get them that base level information

400
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
of the the steps they can take to really

401
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,480
manage risk and build resilience and if

402
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
i could just uh expand on that a little

403
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,000
bit because you know that's pain to the

404
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,360
picture of what happens at the federal

405
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,399
level and when the feds contact a state

406
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
elections official or maybe even a local

407
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,480
you know i can tell you that similarly

408
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,839
we work with a lot of other state

409
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,320
partners in california it's uh you know

410
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,000
the national guard california highway

411
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,880
patrol our state office homeland

412
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,199
security and other partners you know

413
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,399
similarly sharing information uh and uh

414
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,680
expertise uh and just as the federal

415
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,000
government reaches out to states we i

416
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,160
the secretary of state have a constant

417
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,079
dialogue in partnership with each of the

418
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,360
58 counties in california that are in

419
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,240
turn looping in their

420
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,240
county government counterparts whether

421
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,760
it's on the public safety side on the

422
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,279
i.t side

423
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,440
etc so it's really that collective

424
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,959
coordination communication and

425
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,600
collaboration that it that is key here

426
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,079
uh and in california we even invited the

427
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,480
public uh to be a part of it we launched

428
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,519
a vote shirt initiative in 2018

429
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,000
modeled after what we learned in 2016

430
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,720
you know in addition to responding to uh

431
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,800
erroneous information that we may find

432
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,320
online

433
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,480
and providing official reliable

434
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,800
information proactively we've set up a

435
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,880
portal where voters can email us

436
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,639
directly if they come across either

437
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,800
suspicious or what they know is frankly

438
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,519
just bad information about elections and

439
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,360
on opportunity to vote

440
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,920
we do a quick review we've established

441
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
protocols with you know the facebooks

442
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,399
twitters instagrams of the world uh to

443
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,839
bring uh wrong uh posts and content to

444
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,639
their attention uh and uh you know it's

445
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,639
been such a good partnership about 98 of

446
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,839
what we bring to their attention is

447
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,920
pretty promptly taken down for violating

448
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,320
the standards of that social media

449
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,480
platform so the public has a role to

450
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,800
play as well in terms of being aware you

451
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,480
know if they see something say something

452
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,399
we've heard that before not just at the

453
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,680
airport

454
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,600
and it's worked well in elections and

455
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,199
we're going to have to keep that

456
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,440
awareness level up for the next couple

457
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,120
of months

458
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,800
well thanks very much it's very

459
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
encouraging to know that that type of

460
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
communication is going on

461
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,880
uh i'd like to turn our attention now

462
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,959
towards some of the more traditional

463
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,800
voting processes

464
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,040
there are ways of

465
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,079
interfering with those voting processes

466
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,320
bryson i was wondering if you could

467
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,560
address what are the different ways of

468
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,120
compromising those traditional processes

469
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,199
ranging from voter registration all the

470
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,240
way through counting of the ballots

471
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,560
uh yeah just quickly following what alex

472
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,880
said i want to highlight um the joint

473
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,199
agency panel that matt and i were on at

474
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,959
defcon because one of the big things

475
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,480
that we we highlighted with which he

476
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,160
just said is um each of the agencies um

477
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,639
noted how you could contact them to see

478
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,720
something say something um and then we

479
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
published that after defcon so that was

480
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,759
that was one of the big things that came

481
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,439
out as the question to all of the

482
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,359
hackers at that conference was well how

483
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,319
do i get involved um and i think that

484
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,640
also then ties in with

485
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,119
we're all american citizens and american

486
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,959
citizens are the ones who can volunteer

487
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,799
and be a part of these polling stations

488
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,880
and these things so where i'm trying to

489
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,199
lead that is particularly here at obas

490
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,640
right this is also a technical

491
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,679
conference

492
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,760
and uh even though that it's going to be

493
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,080
in october and we're recording it's a

494
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,840
little bit in advance i think there's

495
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,120
still that same call to action um for

496
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,320
everybody in this conference that has

497
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,240
something very unique to add because

498
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
when i look at the biggest risk area

499
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,360
that i see

500
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,200
it goes to and i'm not picking on cheryl

501
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,080
in ohio that matt called out but it's

502
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,240
that there are all of these staff who

503
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,520
are working with antiquated systems

504
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,919
they don't necessarily know what the

505
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,320
gold standard is for defense and doing

506
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,240
those things let alone the equipment and

507
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,640
the complexity that that follows with it

508
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,600
and that's really a challenge um

509
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,640
because

510
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,720
the number one attack surface if i'm

511
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,160
ever going to go after any target

512
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,360
anywhere for anything ever is fishing

513
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,440
why do i like fishing i like fishing

514
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,240
because one it's a game of statistics so

515
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,600
there are a lot of folks particularly

516
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,480
i'm sure there are a lot of folks in

517
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,520
this audience who are going to be like

518
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,919
well i'm a sophisticated technical user

519
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,160
i would never fall for a fish

520
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,600
right i

521
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,080
that's that's simply not true right i am

522
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,240
uh i i have worked offensive research

523
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,760
for over 20 years i come out of the

524
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,280
military and intelligence world uh where

525
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,360
um i was actually targeted for various

526
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,520
things and i still am not confident with

527
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,320
my elevated knowledge and awareness that

528
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,080
i would not i wouldn't fall for a fish

529
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,840
it can happen to anybody because they're

530
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,640
so

531
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,880
hard to see all of the time they're

532
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,720
meant to look that way but the real

533
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,280
thing is the game of statistics it costs

534
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,200
me just as much to send one fish as it

535
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,520
does to send 10 million fish

536
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,720
so i'm just going to keep playing the

537
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,120
numbers there and then you basically

538
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,799
it's like when you invite the vampire in

539
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,799
the garlic no longer works it's the same

540
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,640
thing with getting hacked once you click

541
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,960
that fish they're in the system

542
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,160
so at this point it's kind of a question

543
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,919
of right this this would be where i

544
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,520
would love to show throw you know kind

545
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,400
of a high level generic diagram of all

546
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,919
the systems in play of an election

547
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,600
system architecture but fundamentally it

548
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,320
starts with voter registration that goes

549
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
into poll books poll books have recently

550
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,000
become not recently but have

551
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,559
increasingly become more electronic

552
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,640
because that's my way to be able to

553
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,039
match voter to registration in real time

554
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,880
and things are always changing right is

555
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,720
that a provisional ballot have you moved

556
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
what can i do to make sure that we can

557
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,320
capture your vote then we have the

558
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,679
actual system itself the voting machine

559
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,840
that's going to be capturing the votes

560
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,679
and then the various levels from local

561
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,480
to

562
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,960
state level management systems i do want

563
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,320
to note that for the audience that

564
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,520
aren't familiar with this you notice i

565
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,280
didn't say anything about federal

566
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,600
um as alex and matt have been talking

567
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,520
about this is all managed at the local

568
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,080
and state level so as wonderful or not

569
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,320
wonderful as you think the feds or dhs

570
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,799
is or isn't this really comes down to

571
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,960
alex and his team down below and all

572
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,640
those volunteers that you can be a part

573
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,039
of to understand and improve those

574
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,080
issues with uh surface area um something

575
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,360
else that alex mentioned is he was

576
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,640
talking about how we'd like to make sure

577
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,120
our systems are offline so people in

578
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,760
critical infrastructure are very

579
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,159
aware of the concept of an air gap an

580
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,280
air gap is where you can't just access

581
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,919
my computer easily whatever that device

582
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,520
is easily from the internet because of

583
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,080
course the internet allows the the

584
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,000
attack space to be anywhere i can be in

585
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,520
any country anywhere and as long as of

586
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,559
ip i can get to it the challenge is that

587
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,760
air gaps are never 100 air gaps at some

588
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,640
point they have to connect to something

589
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,559
because if if something sits over there

590
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,400
in isolation it's hard for me to get to

591
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,799
it so how do i get to it what's the

592
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,080
maintenance around that who are the

593
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,440
people that are all a part of that

594
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,799
that's going to be a part of my

595
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,880
targeting when i look at how do i get to

596
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,400
the stuff that's of interest

597
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,080
keep in mind what we've all been saying

598
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,400
about disinformation and the narrative i

599
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
never actually have to accomplish

600
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,559
anything across that i just have to give

601
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,640
the illusion that you're not 100

602
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,200
confident that i didn't

603
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,600
that's the biggest risk that i see and i

604
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,000
i want to throw another um

605
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,159
compliment to a lot of the work that's

606
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,600
been done between fed and the state

607
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,320
level that a great majority of the

608
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,600
networks that are actually doing these

609
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,880
systems

610
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,120
are monitored now and that's a

611
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,799
relatively new thing and why i think

612
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,039
that's important is going back to that

613
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,760
narrative if something happens we have

614
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,320
the ability to detect it whether that's

615
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
mail-in ballots whether that's voter

616
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,520
fraud whether that's somebody actually

617
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,280
trying to manipulate a system whether

618
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,200
that's somebody trying to manipulate a

619
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,760
system um that just displays the results

620
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,760
and the fundamental you know

621
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,520
real part is still there because if i

622
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,360
can change the what looks like election

623
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,120
results on that night then that's going

624
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,640
to create chaos when the next day you

625
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,840
have to go back and say well actually no

626
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,919
that that wasn't the case

627
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,640
so our ability to detect that is key

628
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,280
um and then that that final piece is um

629
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,679
that's the element where

630
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,039
i know the question wasn't really about

631
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,640
mail and ballots but i think that

632
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,559
considering the increased amount the

633
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,880
risk on that narrative mail-in ballots

634
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,400
inherently take

635
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,240
longer to count

636
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,120
and so

637
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,559
folks who are used to staying up late

638
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,919
into the night and having a winner

639
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,679
declared in whatever election that is

640
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,039
most likely not going to be the case

641
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,559
here and that's something that could

642
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,480
stretch for one to two to three weeks

643
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,000
and that is an opportunity for us to

644
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,520
lose control of that narrative even

645
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,880
though the pro

646
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,480
being exactly what it should be doing

647
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,770
with integrity

648
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,280
[Music]

649
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,919
that's a huge point to price and uh if i

650
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,520
if i can you know california's kind of

651
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,200
developed a reputation

652
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,039
for being notoriously slow to finish

653
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,520
counting ballots uh in prior election

654
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,840
cycles and i think for starters you know

655
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,280
frankly we have a heck of a lot more

656
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,760
voters in california than most other

657
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,600
states so it's you know surely a

658
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,400
function of volume uh but yeah the

659
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,760
process for

660
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,720
uh

661
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,960
verifying signatures and all those sorts

662
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,159
of things that help maintain the

663
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,559
integrity of vote by mail i think will

664
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,360
be exacerbated this uh election because

665
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,600
so many other states are ramping up

666
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,360
and expanding vote by mail maybe for the

667
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,760
first time or more significantly than

668
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,240
they have in a long time

669
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,640
so you know in california every election

670
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,400
night we have a pretty good sense of

671
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,559
where most contests are headed in terms

672
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,880
of results but for closed contests and

673
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,799
for final numbers it is going to take a

674
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,720
couple of weeks and so you know when i

675
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,400
mentioned earlier we got to be vigilant

676
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,320
and aware for the next couple of months

677
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,880
that includes post-election

678
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,799
because if the race is too close to call

679
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,600
in

680
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,840
a handful of states let's say oh for

681
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,080
purposes of example michigan

682
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,480
pennsylvania ohio florida arizona etc uh

683
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,159
then we may not know who the winner is

684
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,720
the day after or the day after that and

685
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
that creates that space for

686
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,480
lies and conspiracy theories and all

687
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,320
those sorts of things so we have a work

688
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,279
cut out for us to set expectations now

689
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,919
with the public and the press of what

690
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,640
election night may be like and may not

691
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,360
be like uh you know one of the tools

692
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,679
speaking of vote by mail that we're

693
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,520
expanding statewide in california a

694
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,720
couple of counties have had it in the

695
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,679
past but statewide we launched a program

696
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,360
called where's my ballot

697
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,960
and any voter can subscribe to receive

698
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,679
text message alerts email alerts or

699
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,080
automated phone alerts on the status of

700
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,679
their ballot as it's working its way

701
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,600
through the postal service both on the

702
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
way to the voter and on the way back to

703
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,279
the county with the final alert being

704
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,919
the confirmation that your ballot was

705
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,840
received and counted

706
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,600
it's great for transparency great for

707
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,520
accountability and great for the peace

708
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,039
of mind that we've been talking about so

709
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,679
much that voters deserve to have uh in

710
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,919
the process and look with the recent

711
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,679
chatter about the postal service and

712
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,919
their resources or rule changing you

713
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,559
know we just created a dashboard for

714
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,640
ourselves to identify you know any

715
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,600
bottlenecks or delays in real time

716
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,200
to be able to take action on them

717
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
working in partnership with postal

718
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,600
service representatives at the regional

719
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,559
and local level

720
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,880
so so much of this sounds like it's

721
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,240
focused on

722
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,320
making sure that the electorate has the

723
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,039
confidence even if everything goes right

724
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,520
if the electorate doesn't feel as though

725
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,200
everything has gone right

726
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,159
uh

727
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,600
and then and then even when things go

728
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,400
wrong

729
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,240
there's uh there's backstops uh to those

730
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
uh whether it's the ability to get a

731
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
replacement ballot if uh you know you

732
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,720
made a mistake on one or or what have

733
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,240
you if you missed a deadline things like

734
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
same-day registration you know people

735
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,480
who need to vote in person for uh

736
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,320
whatever reason it's not a vote by mail

737
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,360
only election and you know if things

738
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,840
really go go uh uh hey why are you

739
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,279
always have a chance to cast a

740
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,279
provisional ballot will take longer to

741
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,840
verify and count but it will be counted

742
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,279
so uh people deserve to to feel good

743
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,760
about participation

744
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,440
so that brings me to the topic of

745
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,279
auditing uh

746
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,880
the election and

747
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,559
uh can you speak uh uh secretary padilla

748
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,400
or or matt can you speak to the

749
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,960
importance of uh the audit trail and

750
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,360
what techniques are used to autobots

751
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
right so i'll lead and then uh invite

752
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,679
matt to chime in with more of a national

753
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,320
picture but you know most states do have

754
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,480
some level of post-election audit

755
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,679
requirement

756
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,080
in california every county is required

757
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,039
to conduct a post-election audit uh

758
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,360
after every election you know so we

759
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,880
spoke earlier about the the testing and

760
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,640
certification requirements for voting

761
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,880
systems keeping them offline as part of

762
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,320
that in california paper ballots paper

763
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,240
ballots and a voter verifiable paper

764
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,320
audit trail not just so that when we

765
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,840
count we're counting paper ballots when

766
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,600
we need to recount we recount paper

767
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,480
ballots and when it comes to auditing

768
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,039
you know we're auditing paper

769
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,400
ballots uh for most recent california

770
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,640
history it's been a matter of taking a

771
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,799
one percent manual tally and making sure

772
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,320
that the hand count matches up with the

773
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,440
machine count to ensure the accuracy of

774
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,240
the results uh were one of the handful

775
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,080
of states moving from that

776
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,799
simple one percent policy to more of a

777
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,840
risk limiting audit model right more

778
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,480
sophisticated methodology that should

779
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,200
result in a higher degree of confidence

780
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,679
in the outcome of the results again both

781
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,559
important for accuracy and integrity uh

782
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,559
of the results

783
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,480
yeah just to build off what secretary

784
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,559
padilla said uh this has been a huge

785
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,720
area of focus for us

786
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,039
at dhs uh we've been talking about it

787
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,279
since 2017 that that resilience that

788
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,960
ability to have an auditable paper

789
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,520
record uh is really really critical for

790
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
exactly the reason secretary video lays

791
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,000
out even if uh nothing's happened to any

792
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,679
of the systems if there's concerns

793
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,559
raised

794
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,880
you have to have that ability to go back

795
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,799
and check and recheck and election

796
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,080
officials have put a lot of time into

797
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,360
this what we've seen since 2016 uh to

798
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,640
2020 as a market increase in the uh use

799
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,159
of systems that provide that audible

800
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,279
paper record we're in the mid 80 percent

801
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,320
uh in 2016 we're going to be up over 92

802
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,120
or so of record uh votes cast uh having

803
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,480
that audible paper record in this

804
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,640
upcoming election and what that means uh

805
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,799
is that the vast vast majority of votes

806
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,159
can in fact be audited after the

807
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,760
election now we have to take that next

808
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,000
step right and secretary pedia hit on it

809
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,760
exactly we have to audit those records

810
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,200
we have to have a process in place the

811
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,039
majority of states do and now it's a

812
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,080
question of how do we improve the

813
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,320
efficiency and effectiveness of that

814
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,640
audits at cisa we put our money where

815
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
our mouth is on this uh we've invested

816
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,000
in the development of an open source

817
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,080
post-election audit tool uh that many

818
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,720
states are using uh either piloting or

819
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,360
using statewide uh in order to help

820
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,200
support those efficient effective audits

821
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,960
those wrist limiting audits uh that

822
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,360
folks are looking to do so uh i really

823
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,559
think there's an area of great

824
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,399
improvement since 2016 but an area

825
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,480
that's going to get much and much better

826
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,799
uh because auditing is now part of what

827
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,240
election officials do and now it's just

828
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,080
a matter of finding out the best ways to

829
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,000
do it to offer the most transparency and

830
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,360
the most confidence that your vote was

831
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,799
counted as cast

832
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,559
i just wanted to check can i jump in

833
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,159
real quick because both of them mention

834
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,600
risk limited auditing but i have a

835
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
feeling our audience one doesn't quite

836
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,039
know what that means and two she's

837
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,440
technically uh savvy enough to to

838
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,880
appreciate it so

839
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,320
where alex was talking about shifting

840
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,799
from a simple one to a risk limited

841
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,840
audit what they do is they take a sample

842
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,960
of the

843
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,880
um results to look to see if there's

844
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,640
anything that is statistically

845
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,320
significant that would

846
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,640
call in the results in the question and

847
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,200
if there is you just you keep increasing

848
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,080
the sample size all the way going to 100

849
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,840
of course is the possibility but the

850
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,000
idea is that we're using mathematics and

851
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,480
statistics to draw a conclusive result

852
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,360
that we can back up based on the overall

853
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,919
population of the ballots

854
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,600
well thanks very much for that that

855
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,480
clarification appreciate that person

856
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,440
um

857
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,399
since we are talking to the owasp

858
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,880
audience and web application security is

859
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,559
very important to them i thought we

860
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,360
should talk a little bit about the votes

861
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,320
mobile

862
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,039
uh voting platform uh

863
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,760
there ricey can you describe that system

864
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,399
in the pros and cons of it

865
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,440
sure so votes spelled with a z

866
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,360
um so votes is a blockchain enabled

867
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,039
mobile app

868
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,159
that has been used in elections in west

869
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,720
virginia oregon

870
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,200
utah and some smaller runoffs and

871
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,799
municipals and colorado

872
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,240
so

873
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,919
first i would like to point out that you

874
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,760
know whether we like it or not the

875
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,840
future is always coming um i don't want

876
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,679
to draw a

877
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,559
the line of all of the potential for

878
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,320
risk and

879
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,120
um

880
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,039
the immaturity i think that's the fair

881
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,320
way to phrase it the immaturity where

882
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,840
the platform is now versus where it

883
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,480
could go um so first let's look at

884
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,120
estonia estonia has established a

885
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,760
tradition of online voting to the point

886
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,720
where

887
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,240
every one of their citizens not that

888
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,440
they're in a lot of them i mean

889
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,720
california is like how many multiples of

890
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,559
estonia

891
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,519
but

892
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,519
they have managed considering who's on

893
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,159
their doorstep and the amount of

894
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,200
friction that they've had in their

895
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,360
process to establish a fairly robust

896
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,919
system where voters can use any computer

897
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,399
on the internet to be able to vote part

898
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,080
of why they're able to do that is they

899
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,640
have a very robust

900
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,279
digital identification

901
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,559
infrastructure

902
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,399
we don't have that so that's that's the

903
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,919
problem and why that's important is

904
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,640
because mobile phones are inherently

905
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,200
insecure no matter how awesome you are

906
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,279
as an application developer your

907
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,960
application still has to run on this

908
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,039
device and you don't know what else has

909
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,279
access on that device to do anything um

910
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,640
this is what i always tell everybody

911
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,840
when people are like well how do you

912
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,960
hack something aren't you worried about

913
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,440
encryption i'm like no i don't i never

914
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,679
attack encryption directly i just wait

915
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,919
for your device to decrypt it and then i

916
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,760
take the information and it's the same

917
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,440
kind of problem that you would have with

918
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,799
like a mobile app um my friends over at

919
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,240
trail of bits

920
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,279
a new york city based

921
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,799
hacking company

922
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,399
they did a

923
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,080
study on the votes platform and they

924
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,000
found numerous issues

925
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,200
with how it was implemented um but like

926
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,600
i said i don't want to cast out on it

927
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
from that result i think that the

928
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,679
platform needs a lot of work but i think

929
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,159
is something that could someday be of

930
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,320
interest tied into things like the bill

931
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,200
that's pending um in congress looking at

932
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,960
how we can establish digital

933
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,360
identification because if we can do that

934
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,360
we now have the ability to confidently

935
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,519
know electronically who somebody is and

936
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,360
then that solves a lot of the problems

937
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,600
where you working in a platform that

938
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,919
might not be secure i could still have

939
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,720
the confidence to know what happened or

940
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,320
who did it

941
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,960
yeah if i could just offer a much more

942
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,640
low-tech

943
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,799
comment on this discussion

944
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,080
because i get it all the time when are

945
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,279
we going to be able to vote online or

946
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,640
when can i cast my vote through the

947
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,240
internet etc

948
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,399
there's a key distinction between the

949
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,000
act of voting

950
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,480
and a ton of the other transactions that

951
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,159
we have quickly gotten used to doing

952
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,399
online whether it's gaming or banking or

953
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,720
paying parking tickets or whatever

954
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,720
the difference being are we have a

955
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,480
secret ballot in america right the

956
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,840
privacy of our votes uh is critical you

957
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,159
know from from day one uh

958
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,640
in our democracy uh to try to guard

959
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,799
against uh bribery and coercion and

960
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,320
those sorts of things so while we can't

961
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,120
tell who votes we can't tell you know

962
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,760
who voted for who on their ballot and uh

963
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,919
obviously the the architecture of the

964
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,559
internet uh has failed to provide

965
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,799
the guarantee of that privacy and

966
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,559
secrecy so until

967
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,559
those measures are in place on a more

968
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,640
broad uh and

969
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,679
proven basis uh elections should be one

970
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,000
of the last things to migrate to uh

971
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,600
being done online

972
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,918
yeah i just if i could sorry i just real

973
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,199
quick jump on that because that actually

974
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,119
ties back to a panel that i had with the

975
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,679
um ceo and founder of votes a few months

976
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,599
ago and he drew the corollary he was

977
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,599
like well you know financial

978
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,280
infrastructure already is using a lot of

979
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
these same processes we're like

980
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,918
yeah but the error rate at that is one

981
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,839
to five percent and that is an

982
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,119
unacceptable error rate when we're

983
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,079
talking about our election

984
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,000
infrastructure right somebody hacked

985
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,760
your credit card you're right you can

986
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
contest that with your bank and resolve

987
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,918
it after the fact not so much when

988
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,359
election results are declared and people

989
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,839
are sworn into office

990
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:42,800
yeah

991
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,239
the other part of this is that election

992
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,960
officials have recognized uh this risk

993
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,119
uh and have found creative ways to cut

994
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,960
down some of the time a lot of times uh

995
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,199
when we talk about uh mobile delivery of

996
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,960
ballots or even email about we're

997
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,079
talking about serving military and

998
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,359
overseas voters because they're real

999
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,440
challenges there uh secretary padilla

1000
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,359
and his staff can certainly uh speak to

1001
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,520
that and so what election officials have

1002
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,000
done is is found and frankly the now

1003
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,720
federal law uh captures you could do uh

1004
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,040
online ballot delivery and still receive

1005
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,280
that physical record back right we know

1006
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,359
uh sisa did a risk assessment around

1007
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,800
online ballot delivery marketing and

1008
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,960
return there are ways to manage the risk

1009
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,200
around online ballot delivery on online

1010
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,760
marketing uh online return right now uh

1011
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,520
from a securities perspective for

1012
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,680
exactly the reasons that bryson and

1013
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,280
secretary padilla laid out just just

1014
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,359
can't be done securely with the level of

1015
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,560
of confidence that we need to run

1016
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,960
elections uh but there are ways to serve

1017
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,040
voters and election officials whether

1018
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,720
it's it's that online ballot delivery in

1019
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,320
return the tracking systems that

1020
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,000
secretary padilla has mentioned just

1021
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,160
offering more time

1022
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,000
for folks to be able to return ballots

1023
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,680
uh there are ways to do this and really

1024
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,200
make sure that folks are empowered

1025
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,040
without taking on that that heightened

1026
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,880
risk uh that that online ballot return

1027
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,560
uh really has and so from from our

1028
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,800
perspective at cisa we know uh there's a

1029
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,320
need to serve these voters it's

1030
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,480
important uh and i think election

1031
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,480
officials have really found uh the sweet

1032
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,480
spot between security and and uh access

1033
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,160
in offering things like online ballot

1034
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,839
delivery and marketing without taking

1035
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,680
needing to take that further step of of

1036
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,599
online return we're just not there yet

1037
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,520
uh but as bryson said technology will

1038
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,040
evolve you know over time

1039
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,440
well i'd like to ask each of you uh so

1040
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,599
let's look forward a bit

1041
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,480
uh by 2024 uh you know can we have uh

1042
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,520
online

1043
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,880
voting based applications for voting uh

1044
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,480
do you think it's possible to have by

1045
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,839
2024 and what would have to be done

1046
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,800
i mean i i i don't see it i think

1047
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,480
there's still too much that needs to be

1048
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,240
done and proven

1049
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,480
uh before we uh

1050
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,720
introduce that into the act of voting

1051
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,480
itself but i want to be precise right if

1052
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,240
you think of our democracy as a

1053
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,240
flowchart i think there's a lot of room

1054
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,640
for technology to improve the voter

1055
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,040
experience from the registration side to

1056
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,440
the education side to you know even

1057
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,520
bifurcating you know the ballot process

1058
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,000
as as matt mentioned it's you know first

1059
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,160
half is delivery from the county to the

1060
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,720
voter the other part is the voters sort

1061
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
of casting their votes and then there's

1062
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,960
of course you know tabulation audits

1063
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,040
reporting results etc so if you look at

1064
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,119
that whole spectrum of activity i think

1065
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,200
there's plenty of room for technology to

1066
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,079
improve on how we're doing things but

1067
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,839
when it comes to the cast the the

1068
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,560
casting of your vote uh

1069
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,960
not not right now not soon

1070
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,119
yeah i'll give a really untechnical

1071
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,640
answer that bryson could fill in the

1072
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,200
technical the reality is uh elections

1073
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,359
are evolutionary not revolutionary in

1074
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,640
many ways fast changes uh are generally

1075
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,800
not recommended uh the change

1076
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,480
technologically that would need to take

1077
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,720
place to do it securely uh we're not

1078
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,800
there i mean there's general consensus

1079
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,640
across the entire security community

1080
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,480
about that that the architecture isn't

1081
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
there uh you know folks like matt blais

1082
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,240
have suggested you you need to

1083
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,079
reconfigure the internet itself in some

1084
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,280
ways to tackle this and so uh 2024 is uh

1085
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,880
for many election officials right around

1086
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
the corner when you think about systems

1087
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,680
and in process and implementation uh we

1088
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,760
may get there uh but i wouldn't make any

1089
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
predictions about the next presidential

1090
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,280
election in that way

1091
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,680
i'll give you an example of another use

1092
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,720
of technology that we've uh deployed to

1093
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,680
again add uh add security and improve

1094
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,839
public confidence a lot of us may be

1095
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,839
familiar if there's suspicious activity

1096
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,599
on your credit card your your bank

1097
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,520
attempts to reach you to verify hey is

1098
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,000
this really you um and and you can

1099
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,359
confirm that whether it's through a

1100
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,960
phone call or

1101
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,280
increasingly you get an email right was

1102
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,760
this really you uh so we built that

1103
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,320
capacity into our voter registration

1104
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,400
systems right voting and its

1105
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,839
infrastructure is one thing our voter

1106
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,560
registration databases is another a lot

1107
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,240
of states allow for online voter

1108
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,920
registration or updating of your voter

1109
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,800
registration record so in california now

1110
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,839
we

1111
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,079
confirm changes to a voter registration

1112
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,920
record to a voter

1113
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,599
at their email address and if they

1114
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,040
change that on file we'll send it to

1115
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,280
both the new and the old so a voter who

1116
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,880
now gets an email saying thank you for

1117
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,720
updating your registration record it's

1118
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,240
either confirmation of something that

1119
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,560
they just did or if it wasn't them they

1120
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,400
know to contact the county immediately

1121
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,720
so we can uh rectify that situation

1122
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,160
bryson you have the opinion about 2024

1123
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,079
all right so i i bet and clean up here

1124
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,320
um

1125
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,240
i don't think we're gonna see any

1126
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,920
significant changes by 2024. um uh

1127
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,599
matt captured that really well there's

1128
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,839
gonna be evolutionary not revolutionary

1129
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,160
um and there are so many missing

1130
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,400
components of confidentiality the

1131
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,200
privacy um the assurance of integrity

1132
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,560
and then we haven't talked about it a

1133
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,240
whole lot but availability of these

1134
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,359
systems um again um the is the second

1135
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,520
easiest attack that i can do short of

1136
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,359
getting you to click on an email is

1137
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,440
sending enough traffic to flood and

1138
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,880
overwhelm your services that something

1139
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,920
goes down

1140
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,280
and those are very hard to come back

1141
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,800
from right the denial of service attack

1142
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,520
i

1143
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,000
think the problem is the same so i was

1144
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,560
uh i did an interview with cnn a year

1145
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,720
and a half ago and they were asking me

1146
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
about deep fakes they're like oh well

1147
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,319
how's the world going to you know solve

1148
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,920
the deep fate problem and i was like i

1149
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
don't think there's anything to solve

1150
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,319
whether a d fake is real or not or what

1151
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,800
however realistic it looks

1152
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,560
you have three kinds of people you have

1153
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,680
people who are going to believe it

1154
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,119
because they want to believe it you have

1155
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,560
people who aren't going to believe it

1156
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,520
because they don't want to believe it

1157
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,319
and then you're going to have that

1158
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,240
middle ground that potentially can be

1159
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,800
swayed by the idea and so i think that

1160
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,720
the biggest thing that has pulled is the

1161
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,720
narrative throughout this panel is again

1162
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,680
it's all around transparency trust and

1163
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,160
communication we need the intelligence

1164
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,839
community to be sharing information and

1165
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,240
declassifying information more readily

1166
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,319
with the public that information needs

1167
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,720
to be shared more freely for operational

1168
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,400
reasons to the state into the local

1169
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,520
level

1170
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,040
from a technology perspective i'm not

1171
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,119
really worried about the technology the

1172
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,960
entire combination of local state and

1173
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,720
federal governments have rallied and

1174
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,800
really brought together a combined and

1175
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
amazing response across this country

1176
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,200
that makes me feel comfortable as a

1177
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,359
citizen participating in it i'm still

1178
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,200
worried about all of my fellow citizens

1179
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,880
and the disinformation that is both

1180
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,599
domestic and foreign that continues to

1181
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,920
erode our belief and trust in our own

1182
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,119
democracy and its process

1183
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,480

1196

1203
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,880
information or report something

1204
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,839

1205
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,440
secretary padilla

1206
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,240
sure

1207
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,880
uh for uh for california residents and

1208
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,599
california voters uh one stop shop at

1209
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,000
vote.ca.gov

1210
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,440
for registration options for verifying

1211
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,520
your registration status for poll broker

1212
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,000
information cyber security information

1213
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,359
uh the whole gamut all in one location

1214
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,640
uh so uh

1215
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,200
i think if uh there's one uh area that

1216
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,440
we haven't touched on uh and it's not uh

1217
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,720
high tech by any means uh it's um you

1218
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,400
know kind of make a plan for voters who

1219
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,480
may be worried about uh whether it's if

1220
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,640
i vote by mail what's the security of it

1221
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,800
or impacts of the postal service or if i

1222
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,960
vote in person what's the security of it

1223
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,200
how do i stay safe during covid all

1224
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,880
those sorts of things you know we're

1225
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,040
working diligently at the state and at

1226
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,800
the local level to provide multiple

1227
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,800
options to vote and vote safely and

1228
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,400
we're going to safeguard

1229
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,359
uh the that ballot and the vote counting

1230
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,640
process

1231
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,520
but it is not as beneficial for public

1232
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,839
confidence if voters aren't aware

1233
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,599
they need to be aware of their options

1234
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,359
and they need to be aware of what to do

1235
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,040
so and as i mentioned earlier in

1236
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,359
california we're sending a mail-in

1237
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,160
ballot to every active registered voter

1238
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,720
in california prior to the election so

1239
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,440
we want to make sure they're

1240
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,040
anticipating that ballot in their

1241
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,880
mailbox their option to track the ballot

1242
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,359
both coming and going the in-person

1243
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,480
options for voters who need it and so

1244
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,599
the more we do to educate voters and

1245
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,440
encourage them to make a plan hopefully

1246
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,640
they'll vote early i don't think there's

1247
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,160
too many people waiting until the day

1248
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,760
before the election to decide how to

1249
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,119
vote on this one

1250
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,240
and i'm not just talking about the top

1251
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,079
of the tig i'm talking up and down the

1252
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,560
ballot so if you vote by mail send that

1253
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,319
ballot in early if you can if you're

1254
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,680
going to vote in person and they offer

1255
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,920
early voting in your jurisdiction vote

00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,319
other citizens the best part about it uh

1310
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,640
particularly for for this community uh

1311

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,440

1314
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,440
