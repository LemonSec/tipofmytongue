ellingsworth and today i'm going to be

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,639
speaking to you about olaf sam 2.0

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,160
a flagship

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,960
project from the owasp organization

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,599
used extensively across the world and

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,880
today i'm going to give you an overview

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,680
of

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,840
what the sam project is all about how

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,920
you can use it in your organization and

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,359
some tools of the trade to help you get

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,000
started quickly

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,320
first for background my name is john

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,080
ellingsworth i live in the united states

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,960
in new england area i attended a couple

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,719
universities one in philadelphia one

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,960
both in philadelphia actually i've been

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,480
involved with cybersecurity and web

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
technology for over 20 years working in

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,200
startups i've worked in higher education

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,520
i now work in the corporate world

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,760
doing software development architecture

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,200
security

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,000
software development management

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,399
and currently i'm a member of owasp i'm

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,079
a main chapter lead

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,480
and i'm also a member of the sam core

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,640
project team i'm also a member of

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,000
infoguard and

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,280
ascp

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,760
where i contributed occasionally to

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,040
talks and

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,000
other presentations

35
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,400
so what is stan sam is a software

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,799
assurance maturity model it's a open

37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,520
framework that allows you to

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,320
effectively measure and manage uh

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,439
software development within your

40
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,720
organization

41
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,360
from a security perspective and to

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,200
continuously improve your security

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,640
posture

44
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,360
specifically it's measurable actionable

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,680
and versatile

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,520
by measurable

47
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,759
it allows you to define specific

48
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,400
maturity levels that you would like to

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
achieve within your organization based

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,439
upon

51
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,280
your business pos your

52
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,799
yep i'm going to start to slide over

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,759
yep

54
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,840
software assurance maturity so

55
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,920
yep what is sam sam is a software

56
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
assurance maturity model an open

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,680
framework from a loss that provides an

58
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
effective and measurable way

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,600
for managing software development within

60
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
your organization

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,520
and improving your security posture

62
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,679
within the software development

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,280
functions

64
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,879
it's intended to be a measurable

65
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,959
actionable and versatile

66
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
framework one that allows you to

67
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,319
define maturity levels across your

68
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,000
business and software development

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,520
business practices

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,560
based upon things like risk risk levels

71
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,239
and

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,879
risk ranking it provides clear pathways

73
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,640
for improving your maturity levels that

74
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,360
are

75
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,680
incrementally achievable over time

76
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,160
and it's versatile it doesn't adhere to

77
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,440
a specific

78
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,080
technology process or

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,680
software development practice such as

80
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,760
waterfall or scrum it tends its goal is

81
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,840
to be agnostic to all those

82
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,720
capabilities

83
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,040
so what what resources does sam provide

84
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,280
it provides a way for evaluating your

85
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,200
organization's existing

86
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,280
software security practices what are you

87
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,159
doing today how well are you doing it

88
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,920
what are the opportunities for improving

89
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,680
it uh for

90
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,959
it allows you to build a balanced

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,879
software security assurance program in

92
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,800
well-defined iterations

93
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,080
that are

94
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,879
applicable to your organization's

95
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,040
speed and

96
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,080
your

97
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,920
development life cycle

98
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,519
it allows you to demonstrate these

99
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,560
concrete

100
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280
improvements over time to your security

101
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,400
insurance program by focusing on

102
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,840
specific measurable objectives and

103
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,599
activities and those activities are

104
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,440
designed to be specific to your

105
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,519
particular organization

106
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,519
there's no need to focus on activities

107
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,440
that bring low value

108
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,200
to the organization but instead allow

109
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,920
you to focus on high value activities

110
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,599
that are

111
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,280
achievable in a short turnaround time

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,799
so

113
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,120
sam it's another model

114
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,040
george ep box says the most that could

115
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,040
be expected from any model is that it

116
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,879
can supply a useful approximation to

117
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,959
reality all models are wrong so models

118
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,640
are useful

119
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,840
sam is not a perfect model but it is a

120
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,159
highly usable and adaptable model so in

121
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,680
your organization

122
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,519
you can

123
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,680
tailor it to your organizational needs

124
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,358
and leverage the components of the model

125
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,959
that are most practical and valuable to

126
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,759
your organization

127
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,199
some of the principles there are four

128
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,520
guiding principles for the software

129
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,280
assurance maturity model an

130
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,960
organization's behavior changes slowly

131
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,560
over time

132
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,680
there's no

133
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,280
no reason to try and

134
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,560
boil the ocean

135
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,479
all at once the changes are intended to

136
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,840
be iterative

137
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,360
working towards a long-term goal of

138
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,040
increasing the maturity of not only of

139
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,280
the organization but of the

140
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,960
individual contributors and the teams

141
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,919
involved with that with those goals

142
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,440
there's no single recipe that works for

143
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,040
all organizations

144
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,120
the solution must be risk-based

145
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,440
to the organization

146
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,199
guidance related to security actors must

147
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,120
be prescriptive

148
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,240
there is uh the solution should really

149
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
provide enough guidance

150
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
for people to understand what needs to

151
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,080
be done from a security perspective

152
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,479
particularly for non-security people so

153
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,120
that there's buy-in and alignment with

154
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,360
the goals that you're trying to achieve

155
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,720
and overall it must be simple

156
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,560
well-defined and measurable

157
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,240
and those are the guiding principles of

158
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,560
owa-san and those are the things that

159
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,840
we'll be talking about today

160
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,320
just a bit of brief background on the

161
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,400
project the project the

162
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,280
oauth sam is actually a reincarnation of

163
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,360
an earlier named open sand the open

164
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,600
software assurance maturity model

165
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,639
started in march 2009

166
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,840
it kind of

167
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,000
was released at that time but a lot of

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,520
development did not take place until

169
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
march 2016

170
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,600
when there was a 1.1 version

171
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,520
released but then a decision was also

172
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,479
made

173
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,320
to migrate and

174
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
donate the project over to olaus the

175
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,800
open web application security project in

176
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,840
march 2016.

177
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,319
in during the period of march 2016 to

178
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,800
february 2017 a lot of work was done

179
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,160
particularly around the olaf sam toolkit

180
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,120
and in february 2017 ola sam 1.5 was

181
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
released

182
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,639
since 2017 a lot of work was then

183
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,120
contributed towards 2.0 and in january

184
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,720
2020 of this year

185
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,280
ola sam 2.0 was released

186
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
there's a lot of active development

187
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,240
going on with the project it's currently

188
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,639
hosted on github where you can find more

189
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,240
information and i'll provide some links

190
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,520
later on for you to find that

191
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,639
so at a high level sam isn't it is

192
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,160
intended to provide an adaptable

193
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,680
approach

194
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,319
the cycle generally follows this pattern

195
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,639
here where we prepare

196
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,960
the organization for rollout of a sand

197
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,840
framework we do the assessments we set

198
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,240
the target of maturity levels that we

199
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,080
would like to achieve within

200
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,360
particular software development

201
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,960
functions and the activities involved

202
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,919
with that we defined a plan for that

203
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,759
over time whether that's

204
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,120
a period of

205
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
one year two years three years four

206
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,919
years a multi-phase approach that gets

207
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,960
defined

208
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,840
and then implemented within the

209
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,800
organization and then subsequently

210
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,560
rolled out

211
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,160
once that rollout is done for a

212
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,960
particular phase it makes sense to at

213
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,120
the end of each phase to assess

214
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,039
and evaluate the progress that has been

215
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,560
made

216
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,120
recognize the achievements of the teams

217
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,440
celebrate the maturity that has been

218
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,919
improved and then go through the process

219
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,919
again of evaluating and setting the

220
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,039
target

221
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,720
updating the plan implementing and

222
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,160
rolling it out

223
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,240
until you achieve the desired majority

224
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,520
level within your organization

225
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,919
so sam versions 1.5 and 2.0 um

226
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,840
some big changes between the two

227
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
primarily in

228
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,800
with regard to the number of software

229
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,400
development function business functions

230
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,039
that exist within the framework in 1.5

231
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,319
there are four

232
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,639
in sam 2.0 there were five some of them

233
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,560
were kind of

234
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,440
reevaluated in terms of their

235
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,639
specific

236
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,080
criteria as well as recognizing that

237
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,879
things like scrum and devops and

238
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,199
psychops have

239
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,840
basically required the evaluation of

240
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,360
maturity to be

241
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,440
redefined so new functions were added as

242
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,639
well

243
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,400
there are still three security practices

244
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
for each business function

245
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,000
those security practices are intended to

246
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,679
cover the areas relevant to software

247
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,839
security assurance and software

248
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,120
development from a security perspective

249
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,880
the activities within those practices

250
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,640
are now presented in a more logical flow

251
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
divided into two streams

252
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,800
uh intended to link the activities

253
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,480
within the practice over the various

254
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
maturity levels and we'll talk about a

255
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,880
little bit in a moment and each stream

256
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
is basically an objective that can be

257
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,160
reached within increasing levels of

258
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
maturity this way there aren't

259
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,920
activities that are kind of orphaned or

260
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,480
done on their own that don't have

261
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
some kind of logical relationship to the

262
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,160
other activities being performed by the

263
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,399
team

264
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,360
and so here at a high level is that 1.5

265
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,120
view we can see

266
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
the bit 4 business functions of 1.5 of

267
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
governance construction verification and

268
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,640
operations

269
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,720
each broken down with three separate

270
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,800
security practices

271
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,560
that

272
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,279
we can see here

273
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,720
2.0 basically changed a few of the names

274
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,760
of those for example

275
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,959
construction is no longer within this uh

276
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,560
framework it's been broken out into

277
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,720
design and implementation

278
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,800
uh giving us the five total we have

279
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,399
governance design

280
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,839
implementation verification and

281
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,839
operations

282
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,720
within uh governance

283
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,800
we have strategy and metrics policy and

284
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,680
compliance and education and guidance

285
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,360
those are the things that leadership is

286
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,959
uh tends to be most interested in so a

287
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,120
strong emphasis on establishing those

288
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,200
early as part of your maturity

289
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,000
uh plan is a is a good

290
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,200
good way to

291
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,880
set the set the framework up in your

292
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,079
organization

293
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,519
design

294
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,959
critical phase

295
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,720
threat assessment security requirements

296
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800
and secure architecture foundational

297
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,480
components to that

298
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,560
implementation consists of secure build

299
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,040
secure deployment and defect management

300
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,880
verification we have architecture

301
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,200
assessment requirements for being tested

302
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,760
driven testing and security testing

303
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,839
this is where your pen testing may take

304
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,680
place you may have

305
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
das or sas tools in place where you

306
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,120
might be using

307
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,920
to validate development practices

308
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,760
and then operations we have incident

309
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
management environment management and

310
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,000
operational management

311
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,279
so let's take a look at these a little

312
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,440
more detail

313
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,760
actually these are the

314
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,399
areas that are new within the 2.0

315
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,000
framework

316
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
so let's take a look at those in more

317
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
detail

318
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,920
so

319
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,240
within the governance

320
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,079
function we have

321
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,000
the streams on the left of create and

322
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,399
promote under strategy metrics

323
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,079
policy and standards under policy

324
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,320
compliance and streaming and training

325
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,240
and awareness and stream a so we can see

326
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,959
that

327
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,399
in an organization there might be a

328
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,200
desire to focus upon

329
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,519
a given stream within any of the

330
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,200
business functions and practices within

331
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
those functions

332
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,959
in design we have

333
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,640
under threat assessment

334
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,120
across profile software requirements

335
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,360
architecture design

336
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,079
a nice consideration for the design and

337
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,800
all these as well is that these

338
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
activities and streams may apply to

339
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
scenarios where

340
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,279
you are doing in-house development or

341
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,600
custom development only and you want to

342
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,839
apply the framework specific to that

343
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,279
type of

344
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,480
software management versus software that

345
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,240
you've acquired through a third-party

346
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,519
vendor you may still decide to

347
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,839
use the sam framework against those

348
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,519
third-party vendors that are providing

349
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,279
software for you and do validation of

350
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,560
their maturity levels and

351
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,920
implementations

352
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,519
and those types of things

353
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,720
for assurance within your organization

354
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,519
so secure build we have build process

355
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,600
secure deployment diploma process and

356
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,480
defect management defect tracking and so

357
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,000
each of these streams

358
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,160
have been added to the 2.0 version which

359
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,839
as i mentioned earlier

360
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,160
allow you to focus

361
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,079
on specific objectives within those

362
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,920
business functions

363
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
and achieve maturity levels specific to

364
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,639
your organization

365
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
all right so

366
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,639
when it comes to maturity levels of

367
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,320
scoring

368
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,279
sam is basically defined

369
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,160
um

370
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,120
just

371
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,560
okay i'm going to start over on that

372
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,680
slide

373
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,519
okay

374
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,920
so maturity levels and scoring and in

375
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,279
sam

376
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,040
the intention of the framework of course

377
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,440
is to determine the maturity level of

378
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,360
the software development practices

379
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,040
within your organization and provide

380
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,480
transparency

381
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,160
over the different levels of maturity

382
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,639
within the organization so that you can

383
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,560
tailor

384
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,279
improvements and activities specific

385
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,519
to those majority levels it also

386
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,839
increases visibility to

387
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,120
key stakeholders within your

388
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,560
organization

389
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,399
so the framework generally provides

390
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,000
three levels of maturity there's

391
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,040
actually a

392
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,360
fourth if we consider zero

393
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,480
um

394
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,399
which basically consists of

395
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,279
um

396
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,199
you know an organization may not be

397
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,480
actually doing anything within a

398
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,000
particular activity

399
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,360
and so they're at a level zero

400
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,040
in the case of an organization where

401
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,760
teams are doing things at a ad hoc level

402
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,600
uh they may occasionally do some

403
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,680
pen testing they may have a dynamic

404
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,920
scanning tool that they run occasionally

405
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,639
they may do pen testing once or twice in

406
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,639
the lifetime of an application

407
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,240
but they're not doing it with any kind

408
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,519
of

409
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,760
repeatability

410
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
at level two a team is

411
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,000
actually doing things in a repeatable

412
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,040
manner

413
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,639
with a focus on efficiency and

414
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,839
effectiveness

415
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,839
and they're doing it on

416
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,760
at least half of the applications that

417
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,519
within the organization or within the

418
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,519
scope of the assessment

419
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,440
and level three is

420
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,120
certainly

421
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,279
there is mastery within the organization

422
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,240
across

423
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,480
and across the organization

424
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,160
most are all

425
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,399
stakeholders or applications within

426
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,800
scope are

427
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,639
achieving those active or performing

428
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,000
those activities

429
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
uh and they're evaluating the manually

430
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,519
for example to determine the

431
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,880
effectiveness and

432
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,199
and areas of improvement for those

433
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,479
activities each year

434
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,600
uh so within sam

435
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,639
uh within the version 2 2020

436
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,760
uh there's been some focus on

437
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,120
how the questions were put together

438
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,040
within the assessment toolbox uh the

439
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,199
assessment toolbox is a

440
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,279
basically at this point in time it's a

441
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,360
microsoft excel document uh there are

442
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,440
some other variations of that which

443
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,279
we'll go over shortly but

444
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,160
the founding tool was an excel document

445
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,440
that

446
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,720
basically

447
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,839
asks a series of questions for each uh

448
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,839
within each stream and activity

449
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,519
regarding

450
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,120
what the teams are doing or the

451
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,880
organization is doing with regard to

452
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
that particular question so in this

453
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,800
particular case the question around

454
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,360
strategy and metrics and the promotion

455
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,720
of of risk to prioritize applications by

456
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,639
there's some quality criteria underneath

457
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,240
the question such as you have captured

458
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,000
the risk appetite of your organization's

459
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,399
executive leadership

460
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,839
the organization's leadership have

461
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,839
vetted and approved risks

462
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,279
you've identified the main business and

463
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,720
technical threats your organization's

464
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,040
assets and data and risks are documented

465
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,000
and accessible to relevant stakeholders

466
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,399
there are numerous organizations that

467
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,000
have really not gone through this type

468
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
of risk assessment for for the

469
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,399
applications that they're

470
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,120
basically responsible for and so

471
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,880
this is an area where

472
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,399
prioritizing these things and creating a

473
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,399
set of activities to improve the

474
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,399
maturity of the organization

475
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,399
is instrumental to

476
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,240
effectively improving the organization's

477
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,120
maturity on this particular stream

478
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,160
the questions follow this kind of

479
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,320
template throughout the framework uh

480
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,720
without within the toolbox uh so with

481
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,560
this stream you have

482
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,920
i should say within a

483
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,839
business function such as governance and

484
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,440
under strategy and metrics you have a

485
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,399
stream

486
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,199
and a maturity level a question

487
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,199
and then some quality criteria for that

488
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,240
question

489
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,320
so as you go through the toolbox if you

490
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,639
decide to play around with it you'll you

491
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,320
can read these quality criteria which

492
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,079
will help guide

493
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,000
both the interviewer and

494
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,839
interviewees to understand what is it

495
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,000
that the question is actually asking

496
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,160
and to answer the question as honestly

497
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
as you can with full awareness of what

498
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,839
it means to meet the criteria that's

499
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,760
being asked

500
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,199
we'll take a look at some of those other

501
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,240
questions shortly

502
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,720
so how do you uh

503
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,799
achieve success within your organization

504
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,359
one is you need to have buy-in from key

505
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,839
stakeholders key stakeholders are

506
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,600
maybe product owners software

507
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,360
development team itself members of your

508
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,200
security team if they exist separately

509
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
from software development team

510
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,559
directors managers directors all the way

511
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,280
up to the c level

512
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,200
you want to adopt a risk-based approach

513
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
you definitely want to

514
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,440
do some kind of risk assessment of the

515
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
applications that exist within your

516
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,559
portfolio determine for example

517
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,600
revenue at risk what is the risk of

518
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,799
of us

519
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,640
having some kind of business impact if

520
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,960
we don't focus on this application there

521
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,799
are a lot of risk-based

522
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,960
approaches to determining that that you

523
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,440
can certainly reference and revenue risk

524
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,120
is certainly a good one reputational

525
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,360
risk a lot of different risk factors to

526
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,640
consider but

527
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,320
once you've gone through that risk-based

528
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,679
assessment and

529
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,600
prioritization you can then focus on

530
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,280
those applications that are high risk or

531
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,760
critical risk

532
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,320
uh clearly define the initiative scope

533
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,480
scope is an interesting and and probably

534
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,840
one of the more interesting challenges

535
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,520
within sam and that

536
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,280
you need to very clearly understand

537
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,600
what applications are in scope

538
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,799
for the assessment and

539
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,919
the metrics that you're going to be

540
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,400
generating from that assessment

541
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,720
for example in a large corporation you

542
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,320
may have multiple lines of business and

543
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
within those lines of business you have

544
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,679
may have multiple

545
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,760
product teams each with their own

546
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,760
independent software development teams

547
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,320
supporting those products

548
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,559
you may have and within those lines of

549
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,000
business there are different levels of

550
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
business criticality and risk involved

551
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,080
with those applications so

552
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,760
you definitely want to make sure that

553
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,880
you

554
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,600
segment the applications

555
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,840
into the appropriate scope so that when

556
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,400
you're performing an assessment of

557
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,200
a set of applications you are comparing

558
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,640
apples to apples in terms of the

559
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,559
maturity level and not doing an apples

560
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,880
to oranges comparison

561
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,760
which

562
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,080
because if you do you'll run the risk of

563
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,600
not

564
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,280
you know not fairly

565
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,160
assessing the applications uh imposing

566
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,880
activities and practices on the teams

567
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,240
that are developing those applications

568
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,559
that may be unnecessary and or not

569
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,520
bringing business value

570
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,679
so clearly defining the initiative scope

571
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,160
is is an important factor

572
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,559
awareness education or foundation there

573
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,440
are many organizations where

574
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,120
software development security practices

575
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,880
are just not really understood they're

576
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,200
not uh may not even be aware of them at

577
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,880
certain levels within the organization

578
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,240
so

579
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,840
sharing the

580
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840
activities what should be what should we

581
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,080
be doing is a critical component of

582
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,520
success within

583
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,080
rolling out the framework

584
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,960
integration and automation of course is

585
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,880
is the only way to become scalable in

586
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,200
this day and age so but integrating it

587
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,039
within not only development but

588
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,960
acquisition working with third-party

589
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,120
vendors and also with deployment and

590
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,600
operational side of software development

591
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
you need to really

592
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,919
integrate those fully and automate them

593
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,559
so that you can scale effectively

594
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,080
and most importantly measure so

595
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,760
as as we all know we've heard the phrase

596
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,960
if you're not measuring it you can't

597
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,720
manage manage it

598
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,919
uh and

599
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,840
so this framework will allow you to

600
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
measure the performance over time the

601
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,919
maturity over time and provide

602
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,520
management the visibility they need to

603
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,320
understand how to prioritize not only

604
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,400
resources but

605
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,679
funding

606
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,880
and other

607
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,720
initiatives that support those

608
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,200
activities

609
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,280
okay so we're going to shift a little

610
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,880
bit now and talk about tools of the

611
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,919
trade that will help you help you uh in

612
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,919
your implementation of oawasan within

613
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,440
your organization

614
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,080
um right now we are aware of at least

615
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,799
six tools that exist to help you

616
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,240
get started with the framework and

617
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,919
actually allow you to implement and

618
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,760
fully manage your the program if you

619
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,280
choose to do so

620
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,520
those consist of the ola sam toolkit

621
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,159
provided by the sam project it's a

622
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,799
microsoft excel based version of an

623
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,799
assessment questionnaire

624
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,960
there's a sam 2.0 calculator by concord

625
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,520
usa which is an organization a company

626
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,679
in the united states that provides

627
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,520
security assessments

628
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,480
and services to companies that would

629
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,120
like to leverage their expertise

630
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,200
sam 2.0 dashboard which was developed by

631
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,600
cynthia schashwin and which has been

632
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
actually

633
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,840
been contributed to the ola sam project

634
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
and available on github it's a

635
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,520
standalone application you can run in

636
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,120
your own environment

637
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,280
a loss maturity models is another web

638
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,200
application that you can set up and run

639
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,679
within your organization

640
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,720
there also

641
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,679
is

642
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,400
in active development and evaluation

643
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
the oauth sam toolkit in a google docs

644
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,840
version

645
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,760
so instead of dependency on microsoft

646
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,280
excel we shipped it to google sheets and

647
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,000
are

648
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,559
currently working with that version to

649
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,640
for full compatibility and then there's

650
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,039
the oauth sam assessment which is also

651
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,960
built on google docs using google forms

652
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
and google data studio

653
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,880
which allows you to capture data and

654
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
then run it through some good

655
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,440
visualizations in google data studio

656
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,960
so let's take a quick look at each one

657
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,880
of these and see what they have to offer

658
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,840
the osm toolkit from microsoft excel

659
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,080
it contains all the assessment questions

660
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,919
from the framework there are 90

661
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,600
questions in total

662
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
and it does automatic maturity level

663
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,880
calculations so

664
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,400
as you go through each of the questions

665
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
there's a rating box you can see there

666
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,600
in the screenshot on the right that will

667
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,280
actually

668
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,960
develop or

669
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,080
convey or

670
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,240
represent your current maturity level

671
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,559
there's also a scorecard

672
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,720
tab or sheet within the document within

673
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,640
the file that allows you to visualize

674
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,120
your majority level it has actually a

675
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,200
road map calculation tool that allows

676
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,120
you to

677
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,280
select your

678
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,039
your desired majority level each of the

679
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,760
phases that you go through in order to

680
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,000
successfully come up with a plan and

681
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
then there's a roadmap roadmap chart

682
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,520
that will show you your progress over

683
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,559
time

684
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,880
this is ready to use it's actively

685
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,120
supported actively developed

686
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,480
uh from by the oauth sam project and

687
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,400
you can visit it at go

688
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,320
the github site and download it and get

689
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,760
started

690
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,000
uh here's a kind of a zoom in view of uh

691
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,279
an assessment of teams issue

692
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,200
done in march of this year where they've

693
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,480
done some

694
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,880
answering questions around

695
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,559
strategy and metrics and the creating

696
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,279
promote stream so a rating level of less

697
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,600
than one shows that they're in an ad hoc

698
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
state and there's some opportunity to

699
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,320
prove it to improve it

700
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,240
here on this screen we can see that

701
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,320
after the assessment

702
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,279
was

703
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,640
completed and all the questions were

704
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
answered we can see the current

705
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,760
maturity score for this particular team

706
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,240
we can see in each of the functions and

707
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,360
security practices the maturity level as

708
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,200
well as within

709
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,360
each of the specific maturity levels

710
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
themselves

711
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,440
there's an opportunity for a team it is

712
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,480
possible for a team to generally

713
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,640
do fairly well in

714
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,559
one maturity level versus another which

715
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,440
is just

716
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,080
an

717
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,440
indicator of an opportunity for

718
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,640
improvement on

719
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
other maturity levels so this kind of

720
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,880
view allows us to see the areas where

721
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,200
teams are doing fairly well within a

722
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,840
given maturity and practice

723
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,520
on the right side we have a nice spider

724
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
web chart that shows

725
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,520
how we are currently performing

726
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,440
in with regard to maturity of all the

727
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,400
various practices

728
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,880
uh here's the road mapping tool which uh

729
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,400
for example in

730
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,240
um phase one uh at the top there in pink

731
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,159
we can see that

732
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,480
the current answer to a given question

733
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,679
is no

734
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,159
but we can in phase two we can decide to

735
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,440
focus upon

736
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,600
improving that and changing that to

737
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,679
the next level up uh which would be yes

738
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,520
for at least half of the metrics

739
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,240
so

740
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,720
each of those green cells all the cells

741
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,559
actually in the answer column

742
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,440
is a drop down box that you can

743
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,000
select an answer to improve that

744
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,760
particular maturity if you choose to

745
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,400
to leave it the same the cells and the

746
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,880
subsequent phases will stay white

747
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,159
uh if you

748
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,120
pump it up then it will turn green i

749
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,559
should point out that the pink one there

750
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,840
is an indicator that you've actually

751
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,679
tried to lower the maturity level from

752
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,480
your

753
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,240
from the initial assessment which is not

754
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,559
a recommended practice

755
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,360
so as you do this you can see within

756
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,120
each of the rating columns the maturity

757
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,679
level of each of those practices going

758
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,480
up and over time in the various phases

759
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,760
whether it's

760
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,559
two phases or four phases or n plus one

761
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,200
phases uh your maturity level over time

762
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,840
can can be specifically seen and

763
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,240
measured

764
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,039
so here we see just as a kind of a

765
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,240
prototype uh where the organization was

766
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,679
at the start and then in phase one

767
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,320
phase two phase three and phase four as

768
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,520
a team

769
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,360
uh focuses on those particular

770
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,799
activities in this particular case it

771
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,679
was just a this is just an example for

772
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,880
the governance

773
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,279
function

774
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,559
uh so same 2.0 calculator from concord

775
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,080
usa

776
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
again it's it's similar to the excel

777
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,760
toolkit and that it's a self-guided

778
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,360
sense assessment

779
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,559
uh does a very similar approach to a

780
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,240
breakdown by functions function and

781
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,279
practice

782
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,720
and maturity

783
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
uh it's a web-based tool it's actually

784
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,760
available now you can go to the url at

785
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,200
the bottom of the screen and check out

786
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,120
their application

787
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,440
it provides a progress bar

788
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,480
gives you

789
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,320
feedback as you complete each of the

790
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,960
sections and also if you're

791
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,159
willing to

792
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,080
sign up with your email address you can

793
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,159
become part of the industry benchmark

794
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,360
comparison

795
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,550
and it's ready to use

796
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,080
[Music]

797
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,159
so here's an example of of the web-based

798
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,600
version which as you can see is quite

799
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,840
easy to use you can

800
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,559
show more and see the criteria for the

801
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,159
particular question if you need to

802
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,840
understand the what the question's

803
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
asking a little bit more

804
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,600
and then on the right you can pick the

805
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,279
answer that's most applicable to your

806
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,919
organization

807
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,480
and then at the end of that particular

808
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,559
business function we can see the outcome

809
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,559
and maturity level of a given team at

810
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,799
that time so in this particular case

811
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,440
uh in strategy and metrics 0.25 out of

812
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,399
three

813
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,679
um

814
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,840
an area of opportunity for improvement

815
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,520
uh policy and compliance education

816
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,679
guidance each one of those

817
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,760
practices has a maturity level that you

818
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,120
can you can dive into deeper to

819
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,399
to prioritize further and in this

820
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,159
particular case it gives you a score out

821
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,039
of a total of nine which would be the

822
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,200
sum of each of those practices maturity

823
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,240
level

824
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,919
so again the url at the bottom of the

825
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,679
screen will allow you to do this

826
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,279
assessment at any time

827
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,240
uh sam 2.0 dashboard by cynthia

828
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,480
he developed this

829
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,440
on his own primarily it's a

830
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,919
it's a sas application it's

831
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,679
available at the link at the bottom of

832
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,039
the screen there

833
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,799
uh it's it's

834
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,480
it does have its own authentication

835
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
local authentication with some role

836
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,520
based access control it has a number of

837
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,840
uh nice visualizations within it

838
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,559
including practice trending readiness

839
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,919
factor

840
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,399
trends over time monthly trends

841
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,640
it is an angular project as i said it's

842
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,120
on github under the oaus project it does

843
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,840
allow you to generate a pdf or excel

844
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,279
report for

845
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,600
sharing within your organization uh it

846
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,399
is self-hosted there isn't currently

847
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,080
one of these instances running anywhere

848
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,559
as far as i'm aware of uh that's

849
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,399
certainly likely to change

850
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,559
but it is ready to use if you

851
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,480
would like to to stand it up within your

852
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,799
organization

853
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,679
so

854
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,320
os maturity models is a

855
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,039
node project on github

856
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,080
its primary focus has been more on bsim

857
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,399
which is another maturity model

858
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,440
uh

859
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,000
more focused on descriptive approach of

860
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,720
majority of what organizations are doing

861
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,559
uh and it does have some integration

862
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,399
with oauth sam as you can see here in

863
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,000
the screenshot

864
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,640
self-hosting solution

865
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,279
not sure if it's been updated to 2.0 but

866
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,399
maybe worth exploring

867
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,000
google sheets so google

868
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,399
sheets is a web you know early version

869
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,480
of microsoft excel it's been around for

870
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,399
a while now

871
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,799
in this particular

872
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,919
case we

873
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,080
did an import of the excel version

874
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,279
within two

875
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,520
google sheets and compatibility was

876
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,799
pretty good

877
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,880
certainly some fine tuning

878
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,720
uh was needed and is still needed to

879
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,559
keep it in sync

880
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,960
with the excel version we're working on

881
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,279
looking at automating the integration

882
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,200
between the google sheets and the

883
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,960
updates to the github project so that

884
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
it's for example if

885
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,720
if assessment questions change there's

886
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,240
no need to change the google sheets

887
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,080
version there could be a master that

888
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,000
stays in sync

889
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,080
it can be used it can be exported

890
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,000
as an excel file itself you can use it

891
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,960
locally you can also export data out

892
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,440
to other reporting tools and share with

893
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,120
others

894
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,880
other reporting tools could potentially

895
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,159
include something like google data

896
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,480
studio or tableau

897
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,440
using their automated integration with

898
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,919
google sheets

899
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,640
uh then google forms and data studio are

900
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,080
is yet another

901
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,200
tool that's available so google forms is

902
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
built on top of google sheets allows you

903
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,519
to basically build a survey or an

904
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,679
assessment tool in this case

905
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,279
using google sheets that you can share

906
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,640
with people either within your

907
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,159
organization using

908
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,480
google authentication you can share with

909
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,159
anyone really who has a valid email

910
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,360
address

911
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,440
data is stored in google sheets

912
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,519
it's a pretty easy

913
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,679
it's pretty easy form to maintain in

914
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,039
general

915
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,399
it can be cloned so the existing form at

916
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,000
the link below

917
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,840
you can make a copy of that form and

918
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,480
tailor it to your organization

919
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,519
um

920
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,360
if you'd like responses can be edited

921
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,039
these are features and capabilities

922
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,440
within google forms that you manage and

923
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,640
can set so someone needs to for example

924
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,480
edit an answer or add additional

925
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,440
information to support that answer

926
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,799
they can do so

927
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,960
a nice nice feature about this is that

928
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,080
you can

929
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,919
export it as i said earlier to other

930
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,600
reporting tools in particular google

931
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,679
state data studio

932
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,919
which we've we see here in a screenshot

933
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,720
where an organization has done two

934
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,480
assessments

935
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,880
using the toolkit and then the data from

936
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,279
the toolkit has been plugged into google

937
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,440
data studio giving us some nice visually

938
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,360
visualizations

939
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,480
out of the box that we can see here

940
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,159
it's it's it

941
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,720
it's actively being evaluated and

942
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,399
validated as a viable alternative to the

943
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,200
microsoft excel version just as another

944
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,360
kind of tool in the toolbox for folks to

945
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,039
use to hit the ground running

946
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
so the assessment

947
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,640
toolkit and toolbox is really kind of a

948
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,679
foundational component of the uh

949
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,200
of the framework so we would love to

950
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,399
know

951
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,679
what kind of features you would like to

952
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,399
see in the lawsuit assessment tools um

953
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,799
here on the screen you can see there's a

954
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,080
feature request form that we put

955
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,039
together

956
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,600
just to kind of gather some feedback of

957
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,480
course you can always submit

958
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,360
a request into github on the ola sam

959
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,320
project

960
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,080
as well

961
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,159
and or if you prefer you can drop us a

962
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,720
line at awesome.org contact and let us

963
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,399
know what you think about

964
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,240
uh the assessment tools

965
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,960
uh or the framework in general or any

966
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,320
other thoughts you might have about

967
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,039
obasan

968
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,440
um so we really encourage we can't do

969
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,440
this on our own it's a lot of work for a

970
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,519
small number of global

971
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,159

972
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,760

development this is certainly no no

involved today and continue to be

1011
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,880
involved and hopefully we'll continue to
