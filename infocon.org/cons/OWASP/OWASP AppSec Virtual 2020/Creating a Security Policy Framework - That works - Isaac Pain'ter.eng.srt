1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,360
good morning

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,600
good afternoon and good evening for

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
where ever you are in the world my name

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,440
is isaac painter and i'm a security

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,840
business operations lead at adobe

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,280
and i'll be speaking with you today

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,120
about creating a security policy

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,400
framework that works

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,840
so first and legal stuff just to get out

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,439
of the way is that the language quote in

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,039
this presentation is provided for

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,800
instructive purposes only and does not

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,359
reflect policy language used by adobe

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,880
additionally this language should not be

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,320
copied verbatim by anyone in the

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,920
audience as each company must tailor

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,039
their policies to their own

18
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,399
circumstances

19
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,680
and opinions expressed are my own

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,520
so imagine that you're in this scenario

21
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,200
where you receive an email from somebody

22
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,399
and they say

23
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,920
hey do you know if we have a policy on

24
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,879
this

25
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,879
and you don't know so you loop someone

26
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,320
else into the thread and you say hey do

27
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,000
we have a policy on this and they say

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
well i heard of one but let's go ask

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,680
someone so before you know it you've got

30
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,000
16 to 17 people

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,360
excuse me

32
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,920
added to a thread and one of two

33
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,600
scenarios ends up happening

34
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,280
one you identify that there is no

35
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,760
document that is in existence and you

36
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,519
need it right away for because the

37
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,640
auditors

38
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,880
are asking if you have a policy on this

39
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,560
and you've got to have one otherwise

40
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,119
they're going to identify a gap and so

41
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,560
you go ahead and create one you create

42
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,799
one and then it's not thrown into some

43
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,799
sort of

44
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,000
repository it's forgotten about um and

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,040
you know that's a typical scenario the

46
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,360
other scenario is you end up finding

47
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
that you do actually have one but it's

48
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,960
been two years or three years or 10

49
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,000
years since it was last reviewed uh and

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,840
it the the person who wrote it no longer

51
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,000
works for the company and it has a ton

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,240
of out of date information in it and so

53
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,079
these are common scenarios that we'll

54
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,600
see across the board this is not unique

55
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,680
just a security policy this is policy in

56
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,439
general is that we'll see a lot of these

57
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,960
different scenarios where reviews aren't

58
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,240
happening there's not awareness of the

59
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,840
documents we have old documents that

60
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
haven't been reviewed forever there's no

61
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,640
author ownership they're hard to find

62
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,399
and then there's multiple sources for

63
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,799
all these different documents that

64
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,399
that we need from a governance

65
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,880
perspective

66
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,079
and so if we want to create

67
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,360
a policy structure we need to define

68
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,520
what it is that we that needs to look

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
like and so first off we need to

70
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,040
identify what our governing documents

71
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,640
are so we're going to really emphasize

72
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,319
what a governing document is what a

73
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,879
non-governing document is so governing

74
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,640
documents are things like policies

75
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,840
standards and procedures so your

76
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
policies where you want to start what is

77
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,640
your strategy what is your commitment to

78
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,879
some sort of security subjects or it

79
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,879
could be logical access or it could be

80
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,640
your operations

81
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,040
or it could be just your overall arching

82
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,480
information security policy

83
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
uh regardless of what it is you won't

84
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
want to be able to find what your

85
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,200
strategy commitment is and scale it

86
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
across the company you don't want to

87
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
have factions of policies all over

88
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,080
and then your standards you also want to

89
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,599
scale across the business but those are

90
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,040
going to get into the very specific

91
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,200
requirements of

92
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,519
how you're enforcing your policies or

93
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,760
sorry not how but what it is you're

94
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,360
doing to do the policy then the

95
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,400
procedure is the how the the detailed

96
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,840
instructions and those are typically at

97
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,680
the business process level they're not

98
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,200
always scaled across the business the

99
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,760
entire business might consume them or

100
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
maybe certain teams and services but

101
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,120
those are different teams of services

102
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
that are actually writing them because

103
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,879
they own the process or the procedure or

104
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,760
the diagram or the run book that that

105
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,360
details that those are the instructions

106
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,920
on how you're able to implement the

107
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,680
requirements of the what

108
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,080
and then your your why your why is

109
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,959
really in your policy

110
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,959
so your governing documents are really

111
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,799
your must-haves and then your

112
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,040
non-governing documents are your nice to

113
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,519
haves or your should haves those are

114
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,519
your guidelines your best practices or

115
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,440
your recommendations and so best

116
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,680
practices sometimes can be converted

117
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,879
into your your must-haves

118
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,360
but but you know they're also sometimes

119
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,200
your your should haves or you're nice to

120
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,439
haves

121
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,519
so here's an example of what a

122
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,879
governance structure might look like so

123
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,319
you might have a policy called the

124
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,640
logical access policy and then under

125
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,920
that you have broken it out into

126
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,080
multiple different standards on what it

127
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,879
is

128
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,239
you're doing to meet that commitment

129
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,000
that you've written in your policy and

130
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,840
then these are all the standards that in

131
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,320
the very specific requirements on the

132
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
bare minimum requirements for these

133
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,240
different subject areas so

134
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
so some might say well i didn't you just

135
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
have one logical access policy that has

136
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,919
all these different subjects for account

137
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,680
lifestyle authentication remote access

138
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,960
secrets management customer

139
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,800
authentication but why don't you just

140
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,160
have them all in one policy well then

141
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,280
you're going to get like a 30 page

142
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
policy it's not going to be consumable

143
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,600
it's going to be way too

144
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,520
intimidating for people to read and it's

145
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,720
going to be hard to update it's going to

146
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,120
be unwieldy all around for those

147
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,639
managing the policies and also those

148
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,160
reading the policies and so just to be

149
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,800
able to break it out into more subject

150
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,919
areas

151
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,840
is as much is

152
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,440
helpful so here's an example of some

153
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,320
policy language so your company is

154
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,199
committed to protecting the

155
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,639
confidentiality integrity and

156
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,400
availability of the data with which it

157
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,320
is entrusted your company strives to

158
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,840
protect its ongoing operations from

159
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
known and unknown threats so that's your

160
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
commitment that's your strategy of what

161
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,080
you're going to do that's your why

162
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,000
um

163
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,919
in a logical act this policy might say

164
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,919
something like logical access mechanisms

165
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,680
shall be automated and enforced on your

166
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,800
company information systems in a manner

167
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
aligned with the risk and criticality of

168
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,720
the system and the sensitivity of data

169
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,160
it handles

170
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
so again very high level uh your

171
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,919
policies don't change a whole lot for me

172
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,240
from year to year and then your standard

173
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,440
language is going to get into those very

174
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,560
specific requirements they're going to

175
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,919
be a bit longer they're going to have a

176
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,360
lot more content in them they're going

177
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,440
to change from time to time more often

178
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,840
than your policy might yes for example

179
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,960
you might have an authentication

180
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,880
standard that says passwords must expire

181
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,320
and be changed every blank number of

182
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
days or sooner or you have a vendor

183
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,759
security standard that says a

184
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,440
contractual agreement must be entered

185
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
into and retained with the vendor who

186
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,520
pros who processes or stores your

187
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,160
company confidential data

188
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,560
so as we run into those examples

189
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
here's a few highlights to point out you

190
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,319
want to avoid words

191
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,680
absolutes

192
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,319
like all and any the reason for that is

193
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,080
from a legal perspective when you use

194
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,479
those words you're saying perfection

195
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,400
you're saying 100

196
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,120
so you can strive for that and if you

197
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,840
remove the words all in any in fact

198
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,960
you're still

199
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
it doesn't really drive home the point

200
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,560
anymore and in fact it could even get

201
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,880
you in trouble and so you're saying

202
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,479
you're going to do access reviews on a

203
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,840
quarterly basis well if you say where

204
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
all accounts must be reviewed on a

205
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,199
quarterly basis for access privileges

206
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,720
you know your intention is to do all and

207
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,280
you'll and you could even do all

208
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,199
but if there's any any room for

209
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,039
imperfection it could be held against

210
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,280
you because you used an absolute like

211
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,639
that

212
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,400
and then using words like recommend or

213
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,240
should those are soft and squishy

214
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,360
languages

215
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
that we want to avoid in governing

216
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,720
documents those are better words for

217
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,360
like non-governing documents

218
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,560
words that you want to use in governing

219
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,400
documents are words like a very concrete

220
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
language like must and allowed and

221
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,520
prohibited and shell

222
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,199
so examples of what procedures are

223
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,039
procedures are a governing document they

224
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,400
don't scale across the business because

225
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,840
they really operate at the business

226
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,039
process level they're created by

227
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,120
individual teams and services those

228
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,880
could be rugged books or diagrams or

229
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,120
step-by-step instructions the point here

230
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,880
is that you definitely want to be able

231
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,319
to make those available to who those

232
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
need to be available to and those are

233
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,080
maintained and operated by those

234
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,720
individual teams of services they they

235
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,759
can

236
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,199
make them available to everyone in the

237
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,319
business

238
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,840
if everyone at the company if it needs

239
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,800
to

240
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,240
but they're not necessarily uh

241
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,160
they don't need it you know

242
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,919
the policy and standard level of

243
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,919
subscription that like that company-wide

244
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,680
feel

245
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
so your policy and standard foundation

246
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,440
are really going to meet compliance

247
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,360
controls at a very bare minimum you're

248
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,720
going to have some mandatory content

249
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,039
foundation and so we really want to

250
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,440
satisfy the content of the compliance

251
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,240
controls so i emphasize satisfy here

252
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
because we're not going to take some

253
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,720
requirement out of iso or sock 2 and

254
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,479
copy and paste it into our policies and

255
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,639
our standards that's not that's not

256
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,560
really going to work well because it may

257
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
not match the culture or the processes

258
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,639
or the terminology that you use at your

259
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,599
company and so adopting the right

260
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,680
language for your company while still

261
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,919
meeting different compliance frameworks

262
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,080
is important and so we want to satisfy

263
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,679
those controls we don't want to just you

264
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,559
know

265
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,479
copy them verbatim

266
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,320
and then you want to build on compliance

267
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,559
while compliance is important uh you

268
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,320
certainly don't want to stop at just

269
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,480
meeting compliance and checking that box

270
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,000
you need to go above and beyond and have

271
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,519
other benchmark best practices so i

272
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,160
mentioned earlier that best practices

273
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,200
could be

274
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,240
an uh a non-governing document um you

275
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,839
know there might be an industry document

276
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,200
that says what the best practices are

277
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,040
and those are really non-governing

278
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,320
documents but you might take some of

279
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,519
those best practices and actually

280
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,880
integrate them into your policies and

281
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,120
send these and say these are must at our

282
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,959
company and then you have company

283
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,480
specific requirements

284
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,800
it might be a risk that nobody else has

285
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,519
in

286
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,760
in the industry or across your or or

287
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,440
across your competitors or whatever it

288
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
might be and so you need to write in a

289
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,040
requirement a security requirement

290
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,200
that's unique to your company and so you

291
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,839
build on that compliance foundation

292
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,399
doing those two things

293
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,399
uh so diving a bit deeper on what the

294
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,440
structure would look like so you're

295
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,080
gonna have those compliance uh meet

296
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,839
satisfying those compliance controls and

297
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,959
then you're also gonna have company

298
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,200
specific requirements and benchmark best

299
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,560
practices

300
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,880
that apply to all environments across

301
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,959
the board and so you want to scale that

302
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,040
as much as possible as the bare minimum

303
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
requirements but then you might have

304
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
some other areas in the company that are

305
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,120
cardinal to data environments where if

306
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,240
you're like a very highly regulated

307
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,800
company or industry you might all your

308
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
environments might meet pci hip and

309
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
federal because you may not need

310
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,880
breakout sections of documents for this

311
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,600
but for some companies

312
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,760
for example

313
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
for example at adobe we have card holder

314
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,839
data environments but not every single

315
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,240
one of our environments has to adhere to

316
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,600
the pci dss framework and so

317
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,120
for those credible data environments

318
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,200
they have to adhere to the requirements

319
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
that are

320
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,160
all above here which is the all

321
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,839
environments those companies specific

322
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,000
requirements and the compliance controls

323
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
but then they also have to adhere to

324
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,760
those additional stringent requirements

325
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,279
for cardholder data environments or

326
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,519
environments containing uh protected

327
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,240
health information or

328
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,120
environments that that work with

329
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,640
government contract

330
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,120
with governments or with the u.s federal

331
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,720
government in this case and then there's

332
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,959
other um more stringent frameworks out

333
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,200
there besides pc hipaa or fedora

334
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,120
that may um be broken out and the

335
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,720
purpose for that is that you're not just

336
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,959
creating a hipaa security

337
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,839
set of documents or a federal

338
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,360
policy or

339
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,160
a pci set of security documents instead

340
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,920
you're able to scale those documents

341
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,360
across all different compliance

342
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,120
frameworks and where those are unique

343
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,480
you just call it out in a separate

344
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,240
section within the same documents that

345
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,519
you already use across the board so

346
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,720
you're not having to

347
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,480
multiply your documents unnecessarily

348
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,959
so one source of truth is very important

349
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,399
is that

350
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,240
individuals over time

351
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,800
your employees over time will start to

352
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,399
learn where it is that your policies

353
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,399
live but if they live here and here and

354
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,320
here and here then you're not going to

355
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,120
have one uniform way to

356
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,560
identify where your documents are it's

357
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,320
also it makes it really hard to review

358
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,440
and update

359
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,320
and so

360
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
our recommendation what we do at adobe

361
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,600
is we actually have an internet site

362
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,839
that we call inside adobe and it has a

363
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,800
search box and we put a pdf of all our

364
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,600
policies and standards on that site and

365
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,519
so we also have a site where they're you

366
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,360
know they're all linked it's our

367
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,320
technology policies and standards but we

368
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,480
also have it indexed so if you search by

369
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,240
keywords or search by the title of the

370
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,519
document it's going to come up in the

371
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,600
search now i know there's other policy

372
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
management tools out there that you know

373
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,519
integrate with sharepoint and those are

374
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,120
great as well this is just something

375
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,240
that's worked really well for us

376
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,519
so this is really the meat of our

377
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,839
process at adobe of what we've done to

378
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,440
really turn the corner

379
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,519
on our policies and standards and so

380
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,920
sometimes the scenario is where a number

381
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,600
of compliance individuals get in a room

382
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,200
and they write say a wireless security

383
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,120
standard and in that wireless security

384
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,320
standard they write what the

385
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,519
requirements are for compliance

386
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,760
perspective and then they uh and you

387
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,040
know meet compliance or maybe they'll

388
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,399
write in a few additional ones and then

389
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,600
they go to the person who actually

390
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,519
implements the wireless security at the

391
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,839
company and then say okay this is what

392
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,680
you have to follow now there's not a

393
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,200
whole lot of buy-in with that kind of

394
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,639
approach

395
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,240
instead the better model is to have a

396
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,560
coordinator typically someone who works

397
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,240
in a compliance role so at least they

398
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,160
know the

399
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,399
minimum compliance requirements

400
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,320
working directly with those process and

401
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,600
control owners the people who are

402
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,839
actually implementing those security

403
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,079
requirements at your company and so

404
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,760
they're coaching them on how to write a

405
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,880
document typically the coordinator is

406
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,639
going to do a lot of the writing and

407
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,720
helping because the driver may not be as

408
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,800
familiar with that but their direct

409
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,639
input is very important so that you're

410
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,079
meeting compliance but you're also

411
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,680
getting a realistic

412
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,120
written picture

413
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,440
of what the company is actually doing so

414
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,120
that you're not stating things that are

415
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,880
aspirational but you're seeing things

416
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,240
that are realistic but still meeting

417
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,399
compliance and also meeting the other

418
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,079
company specific requirements or best

419
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,279
practices

420
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,480
and then you have your approvers which

421
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,880
are typically operating at like a vp

422
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,399
senior manager or director level and

423
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,480
then your contributors are really

424
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,000
important to the process you might have

425
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,760
other wireless security experts using a

426
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
wireless security example

427
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,560
or

428
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,720
you might have

429
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,120
legal individuals or other compliance

430
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,160
individuals or um management that just

431
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,639
wants to be involved or at least

432
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,079
throughout the process as you're

433
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,000
reviewing this document

434
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,440
and and then we have our inform those

435
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,959
are individuals who don't necessarily

436
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,839
need to be part of the review or part of

437
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,639
actually creating a a policy or standard

438
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,000
but they need to know when it's been

439
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,079
published at least and so this whole

440
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,920
idea around collaborative intelligence

441
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,839
is really really important so that we

442
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,399
can kind of crowd source these documents

443
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,440
and get

444
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,720
everyone

445
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,959
input so then later we get everyone's

446
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,920
buy-in

447
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,839
i can't count the number of times where

448
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,000
you'll publish a document um and

449
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,079
regardless of how hard you try

450
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,680
even after it's published there will be

451
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,000
complaints but there's a lot less

452
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,680
complaints if you try to get as much

453
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,639
collaborative intelligence to start um

454
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,639
rather than trying to get that input

455
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,959
later

456
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,959
and so here's what a typical review

457
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,240
cycle would look like you develop your

458
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,600
documents you put them under review you

459
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,839
approve them you publish them and then

460
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,399
eventually they may be retired or merged

461
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,800
with another document and then typically

462
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,720
those documents rep eat half that

463
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,000
process

464
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,440
on an annual basis

465
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,600
so looking at that life cycle and then

466
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,320
also our daisy model drivers approvers

467
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
contributors then informed is that our

468
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,240
drivers contributors and approvers as we

469
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,279
actually have automation and

470
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,120
notifications around this is that there

471
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,800
are a lot of different policy management

472
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,160
applications out there that may have a

473
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,639
slightly different approach to this but

474
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,560
this is exactly what we've we've created

475
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,639
with our own tool we created in-house

476
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,560
using um some

477
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,160
features in archer

478
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,120
and

479
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,440
uh we we had our drivers contributors

480
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,519
and approvers um they're notified

481
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,800
automatically

482
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,160
when

483
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,839
when a document is under review and this

484
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,399
is done on on an annual basis

485
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,160
and then

486
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,680
uh then they're also notified when the

487
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,920
documents are in approval and published

488
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,360
and the drivers contributors and

489
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,199
approvers and those informed are

490
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,440
different for every document and so our

491
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,160
workspace in our tool actually tracks

492
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,079
who those individuals are and it changes

493
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,759
all the time having to constantly update

494
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,680
those but it's better than having to

495
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,040
send out an email and try to find out

496
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,240
who should be involved we just already

497
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,560
have it documented and automated

498
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,079
and then those who are informed they're

499
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,560
just notified when it's published um you

500
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
know in our case it's often individuals

501
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,480
who work in like a security engagement

502
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,000
where they're talking about customers

503
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,759
and answering questions so they need to

504
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,279
know when documents have been published

505
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,279
again so that they can review what has

506
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,680
changed

507
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,320
so

508
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,880
managing changes um around policies and

509
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
standards so a history section is really

510
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,120
important so that the approvers can then

511
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,320
look through the

512
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,800
a summary of the history section so they

513
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,399
know what it is they're approving rather

514
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,680
having to read through the document this

515
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,360
is also really important for those that

516
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,480
are informed

517
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
about a publication of a document and

518
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,320
then we have notifications which we've

519
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,839
talked about we also have quarterly

520
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,199
briefings and quarterly summaries so our

521
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,519
quarterly briefings are in person are

522
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,720
sorry

523
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,560
right now virtually with our security

524
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,639
champions where we

525
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,360
provide a summary of what actually has

526
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,880
occurred and then our quarterly summary

527
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,320
is really the email that we send out to

528
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,399
our security champions and a number of

529
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,639
other security interested people as to

530
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,839
what has

531
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,160
been updated in our security policies

532
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,000
and standards so that way we're keeping

533
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
people continually informed continuing

534
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,480
to socialize and evangelize the fact

535
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,400
that these documents exist and what has

536
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,599
changed in them

537
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,280
and then we also have our tool that we

538
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,079
use

539
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,559
that tracks uh that tracks all of the

540
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,880
requested changes so we'll get changes

541
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,400
throughout an entire year we're able to

542
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,919
track those and when the documents under

543
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,839
annually review

544
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,439
we're able to

545
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,200
bring all those change requests up at

546
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,840
one time rather than having to

547
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,120
haphazardly put them in periodically now

548
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,360
every once in a while um there is an

549
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,600
emergency update and those are sometimes

550
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,799
justified because maybe we'll state

551
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,160
something that's misleading or we'll

552
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,240
state something that we shouldn't have

553
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,919
stated that's actually not realistic or

554
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:44,960
actually not even happening in the

555
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,799
company and so we'll have to remove

556
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,679
those

557
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,799
and so

558
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,480
those will happen every once in a while

559
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,640
but for the most part you'll just have

560
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,400
these kind of requested changes that can

561
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,919
wait until the annual update

562
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,640
so this is what really helped us turn

563
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,960
the corner at adobe is creating some

564
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,640
sort of uniform and professional

565
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,880
branding on our policies and standards

566
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,840
so we created this artwork um and we put

567
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,360
it as a header well we didn't create it

568
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,559
but we used this artwork that was

569
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,400
already in place at our company

570
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,160
through some of our branding and we

571
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,360
worked with our branding team to

572
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,880
actually put this on our policies and

573
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,120
standards and then

574
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,080
it gave it a more serious tone to it and

575
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,799
we only exclusively use this artwork on

576
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,960
our policies and standards so that it's

577
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,520
clear that this is a technology and

578
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,400
security policy or standard and we don't

579
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,000
use it on procedures we don't use it on

580
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,840
our non-governing documents it's

581
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,360
important that this is what you're

582
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,520
looking at when you see that artwork is

583
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,120
that you're looking at the bare minimum

584
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,640
requirements or the strategy and

585
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,679
commitment

586
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,200
that the company has made in regards to

587
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,400
technology and security that's what

588
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,919
you're about to read

589
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,200
and so it's a very quick identifier

590
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,080
with

591
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,240
our security policies and standards and

592
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
so this is this has really

593
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,840
actually helped us quite a bit to be

594
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,760
able to do that

595
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,280
um and we

596
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,120
uh we don't have like a separate we use

597
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,799
like a separate template for procedures

598
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,360
um we don't have something

599
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,400
like this we

600
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,240
exclusively use this for our policies

601
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,799
and standards

602
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,799
so

603
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,000
exceptions is uh as a whole

604
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,400
it's related to policies i'm directly

605
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,760
related to it

606
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,080
but it's also a totally separate process

607
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,760
is that sometimes you need a documented

608
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
allowance to deviate from security or

609
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,840
technology governing requirements and

610
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,160
really exceptions are a last resort but

611
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,200
you need to be able to document that and

612
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,559
you need to have a process in place in

613
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,240
fact iso 27001 specifically mandates

614
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,600
that you have a policy exceptions

615
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,679
process it doesn't say how it needs to

616
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,280
be done or what are the minimum

617
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,360
requirements for having one but it does

618
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,600
say you need to have one so this is what

619
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,960
we've done in adobe and it's worked well

620
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,799
for us and so hopefully this is a good

621
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,039
baseline

622
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,840
so

623
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,320
summarizing what we do is that we we

624
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,080
have we have a tool that we use and

625
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,520
that's part of

626
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
our policy management tool

627
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,600
where people fill out a form when they

628
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,640
want

629
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,960
some sort of exception in that form they

630
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,840
cannot request exceptions

631
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,679
that last longer than one year it has to

632
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,679
be less than one year and there's no

633
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,360
permanent exceptions the reason for that

634
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,880
let me just give an example and say that

635
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,840
you've got a tool and you can't meet the

636
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,520
the standard requirement that

637
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,520
multi-factor authentication would be in

638
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,360
place that tool doesn't offer

639
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,679
multi-factor authentication and so you

640
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,200
say look we need an exception to this

641
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,480
requirement and

642
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,039
and so it makes sense um but they say

643
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,720
look the tool's never going to change

644
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,320
but that's not true the tool might

645
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,480
change the tool might actually implement

646
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,200
fmfa down the road and so you need to

647
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,360
make it a one year and a max and then

648
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,960
one year let's revisit that and ask the

649
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,840
question is mfa now available and this

650
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
could this this kind of that's a very

651
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,600
simple scenario but you always need to

652
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,679
revisit is this request can this

653
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,919
requirement be implemented now or can we

654
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,760
implement better mitigating measures

655
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,400
that this the status quo always needs to

656
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,919
be questioned and so that's why we don't

657
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,080
ever allow permanent exceptions

658
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,679
and then the submitter and the

659
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,200
submitters management has to accept the

660
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,280
risk and that needs to be documented and

661
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,720
then there needs to be some sort of

662
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,480
independent review that's also document

663
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,400
that's typically someone in security or

664
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,559
our compliance security function that's

665
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,799
independently reviewing what the team is

666
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,840
requesting

667
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,799
and then

668
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,559
you have to have mitigating measures in

669
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,840
place if you're not implementing a

670
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,440
requirement what are you doing to reduce

671
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,960
the risk of not implementing that

672
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,480
requirement and that needs to be

673
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,280
documented as well

674
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,760
so with exceptions and policy and

675
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,919
standard and procedures those governing

676
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,679
documents non-governing documents using

677
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,960
the right words

678
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
branding notifications we've talked

679
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,480
about a lot of things here

680
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,000
but really this creates an ideal

681
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,960
scenario where you have define ownership

682
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,280
you're able to have better

683
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,120
increased awareness by having one source

684
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,240
of truth

685
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
you're sending out quarterly briefings

686
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,640
uh you're in quarterly summaries you're

687
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,320
able to have your

688
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,640
documents indexed on some sort of

689
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,000
internet site or sharepoint site or

690
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,760
whatever it is that you could use

691
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,960
you're able to scale the business

692
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,880
because these are company-wide policies

693
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,480
and standards that everyone can

694
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,559
subscribe to and buy into

695
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,240
there is a lot more buy-in as well

696
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,400
because people are involved throughout

697
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,960
the process not after the process and

698
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,240
there's alignment with compliance we're

699
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,600
able to meet bare minimum compliance

700
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,720
requirements we don't have uh a plethora

701
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
of we don't have hundreds of thousands

702
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,919
of documents across the board and said

703
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,360
we have a consolidated approach to our

704
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
policies and standards where they can be

705
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,559
identified by titles and subjects and

706
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,960
and we're able to uh and we're able to

707
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,799
tie all that back we're able to tie our

708
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,240
exceptions back to all those different

709
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,000
policies and standards that we know

710
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,760
exist in in that one source of truth

711
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,600
