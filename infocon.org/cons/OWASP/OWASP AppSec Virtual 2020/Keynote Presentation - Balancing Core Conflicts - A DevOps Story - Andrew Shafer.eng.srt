andrew clay shafer has a long history

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,800
helping people deliver systems with

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
better tools and processes

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,519
evangelizing devsecops before devsecops

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,840
was a word and helping to organize the

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,000
devops community since the earliest days

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,600
of the movement

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,520
gravitating to agile methods as a

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,040
competitive advantage for software

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,200
development at startups in the early

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,920
2000s andrew pioneered new ways of

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,160
working to automate systems that evolved

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,760
into practices that are now mainstream

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,079
interestingly as part of owasp's

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
operating plan for 2021 the goal of the

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,600
year is to help fund grants that let

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
project leaders build devsecops into

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
everything we do at owasp

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,400
we really want developers to be central

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
to our mission once more

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,280
working to the side of development teams

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,200
telling them that their baby is very

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
ugly is basically the worst way

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,880
imaginable to develop secure

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,400
applications

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,240
developers see you as the enemy and

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,720
things that would be simple fixes become

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,000
onerous and adversarial for no reasons

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,560
we as an industry must move beyond

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,960
pretending to be auditors because with

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,079
few exceptions we are not auditors

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,840
i look forward to hearing from andrew on

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,159
how we can move the industry forward

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,840
please welcome andrew shafer

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,720
welcome

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,560
hello out there

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,680
i'd like to start by thanking the owasp

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
organizers for inviting me to give this

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,640
presentation and i'd like to thank you

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,720
for choosing to spend the next hour with

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,000
me

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,520
i'm andrew clay shafer and i'm going to

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,960
talk a little bit about

51
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,280
embracing conflict a devops story

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,439
hopefully you're somewhere safe with a

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,720
time zone appropriate beverage

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,038
of your choosing

55
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,640
an alternative title for this would be

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,120
software is eating software

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,640
or maybe

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,319
software is eating software security but

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,080
it's also eating everything else as uh

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,879
some of you might know so just a real

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,480
quick introduction

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,120
i'm andrew clay shafer and essentially

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,959
the last decade of my career has been

64
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,640
spent focused on

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
open source infrastructure

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,400
and a bunch of tools for doing

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,680
automation around you know clouds and

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
also bringing the

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,720
the practices to to to that and you know

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,560
i've been part of devops days which i'm

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
going to explain a little bit about and

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,640
uh participated in writing

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,879
some books and there's a bunch of those

74
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,480
all i'll kind of mention in passing as

75
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,440
well and then the last year i've been at

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,239
red hat focus on helping organizations

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,720
really marry the the best open source

78
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,319
projects with the best practices to get

79
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,920
the most out of their technology

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,440
investments

81
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,159
so like i mentioned i'm a red hat that's

82
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,760
my twitter handle so that's also very

83
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,599
important this is a fastest way to get

84
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,599
ahold of me if you want to continue this

85
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,000
conversation or talk about anything else

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,120
you can hit me there or linkedin i'll re

87
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,280
respond to twitter probably faster

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
but what have you

89
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,560
this is my logo

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,519
and

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,120
just to kind of

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,080
keep you

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
full disclosure i come in various

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,280
configurations of hair and beard

95
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,879
so if you run into me somewhere else i

96
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,640
might look slightly different i'm not

97
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,200
sure if this is my uh covered beard or

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,599
my election beard but right now we're

99
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,879
we're

100
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,680
avoiding the barber and the razor so

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,400
with that let's move on

102
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,319
i i i don't really like the word

103
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,119
devsecops

104
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,159
i also didn't particularly like the the

105
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,640
word devops

106
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,080
and i'll talk a little bit more about

107
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,400
that and before that i really didn't

108
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,720
like the word cloud

109
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,879
and but here we are right so this is

110
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,040
this is the the industry we're in and

111
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,840
and

112
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,599
the buzzwords of the day and the fashion

113
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,280
tribalism

114
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
so get off my lawn

115
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,759
i'm a grumpy old man sometimes

116
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,478
so today i'm going to talk about me

117
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,720
in some ways i'm going to talk about you

118
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,160
and us

119
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,600
and devops in conflict and confusion

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,960
and software and security and hopefully

121
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,759
hope

122
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,560
by the end of it

123
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,199
sometimes people introduce me by saying

124
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,600
silly things like this so

125
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,240
i invented devops

126
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,919
i i think that's uh

127
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,719
actually absurd

128
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,400
and if not embarrassing

129
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
certainly a little embarrassing to me

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,440
sometimes once people say that

131
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,360
because the truth is i didn't invent

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,840
devops

133
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,560
i stole it

134
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,680
i had a very fortunate

135
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,160
perspective to to see a lot of things

136
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,400
evolve in the industry and i was in a

137
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
place where i could talk about them so

138
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,160
there's not really root cause and this

139
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,199
has been an ongoing discussion

140
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,199
on twitter the last few days actually is

141
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
like where some of these ideas came from

142
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280
and i'm going to argue and and you know

143
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,919
you'll see uh in a few minutes that they

144
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,440
kind of they kind of came from

145
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,120
everywhere there's there's no like one

146
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,560
place but

147
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,880
there was a particular point in time

148
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,039
that that captured kind of the gestalt

149
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,880
of some of these conversations

150
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,600
and i'll all point to velocity

151
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
conference as one of the kind of

152
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,479
proto devops so so this is velocity 2009

153
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,400
this is before devops

154
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
is is coined as a term

155
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720
and i'm in the audience watching my

156
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,680
friends john allspa and paul hammond

157
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,400
give their presentation of

158
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,120
10 deploys per day devnops cooperation

159
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,240
of flickr

160
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,919
and this is there's you know you can go

161
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,080
watch this talk it's actually recorded

162
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,319
and and they were making some really

163
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,240
good points and and it was a it was a

164
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,800
fun talk and at the time it was also

165
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,680
kind of

166
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
mind-blowing for for people to say that

167
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,000
they are doing 10 deploys per day

168
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,720
now that's actually i'd say passe and

169
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,840
you have

170
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,319
places on on record at deploying

171
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,400
basically every second you know across

172
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,280
the

173
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,520
fairly fairly massive

174
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,199
micro service architecture where

175
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,479
everything's decoupled and you can

176
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,720
deploy independently that's that's past

177
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,800
day now and you know continuous delivery

178
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,240
devops whatever there's like a bunch of

179
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,880
buzzwords that led to this but

180
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,960
at the time this was this was

181
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,800
mind-blowing so i was in the audience

182
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,199
2009 and i was i was tweeting as as

183
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,400
people did

184
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,759
as people did

185
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,560
and and this is uh basically me

186
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,680
quoting um john allspaw

187
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,440
don't just say no you aren't respecting

188
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
other people's problems

189
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,800
and i happen to tag it devops

190
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,960
and here's a bunch more and i don't

191
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,800
necessarily need to read them all for

192
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,720
you but you can you can see that's

193
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,080
basically

194
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,520
operations and development talking back

195
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,080
and forth about how they they need

196
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,759
everyone to kind of

197
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,800
have a trust and collaborate and respect

198
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,280
to get the most out of of the work they

199
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,680
do together

200
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,880
and i'd already been conspiring with

201
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,319
patrick the block who i met in 2008

202
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,479
and we were planning to do

203
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,960
uh so i met i met patrick at the agile

204
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,199
conference in 2008

205
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,759
in toronto and and we were planning to

206
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,720
do

207
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,400
some

208
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,840
conference

209
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,919
that was focused on

210
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,840
agile infrastructure or trying to bring

211
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
kind of agile software development

212
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,800
practices to infrastructure and he was

213
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,000
he was watching this uh tweet stream

214
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,520
from velocity

215
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,319
and and he said

216
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,840
we're gonna call it devops days and

217
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,120
that's kind of the

218
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,520
the first use of that term

219
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,039
and and the kind of like the gestalt

220
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,639
that was created from

221
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,560
devops days and that community of

222
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,639
practice that grew out of that is is

223
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,840
where we get the

224
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,080
the buzzword user

225
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,479
but that was 2009

226
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,280
and this is 2006.

227
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,000
so this is a

228
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,240
interview with werner vogels who's the

229
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,640
cto of amazon he was the cto of amazon

230
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,360
at the time he's still the cto of amazon

231
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,958
and in this interview

232
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,760
he says and i'll read it the traditional

233
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,599
model is that you take your software to

234
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,279
the wall that separates development

235
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,440
operations and throw it over and then

236
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,760
forget about it not amazon you build it

237
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,959
you run it

238
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,720
this brings developers into contact with

239
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,000
the day-to-day operation of their

240
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,279
software

241
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,560
it also brings them into day-to-day

242
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,480
contact with the customer this customer

243
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,080
feedback loop is essential for improving

244
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,760
the quality of service

245
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,240
this is 2006 that sounds suspiciously

246
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,920
like a lot of the conversations people

247
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,560
have in the devops community

248
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,800
i'm gonna i'm gonna argue this is

249
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,480
something that all the kind of cloud

250
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
natives which is another term we'll kind

251
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,880
of use a bit in this talk

252
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,200
they kind of go through this phase where

253
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,760
the developers have some ownership for

254
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
the operational burden of the services

255
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,440
they build

256
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,399
i personally feel like the sre model

257
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,160
kind of takes that a step farther and

258
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,839
we'll talk a bit about what that what

259
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,519
that means as we get through this and

260
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,000
i'm gonna hopefully tie that back to

261
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,839
some notions of security as well so this

262
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,680
is 2006 so this

263
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
you know we're taking snapshots in time

264
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,680
and i think it's important to to mark

265
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,399
the year so 2009 is when devops the term

266
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,640
2006 verner vogel's talking like this

267
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,920
this is 2007 and this is from a blog

268
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,839
post which you can which you can go read

269
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,120
on um

270
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,040
o'reilly radar

271
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,720
which is the

272
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,839
framing from jesse robbins who at the

273
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,560
time was working at amazon

274
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,360
and

275
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,160
specifically in operations and and he is

276
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
making this argument that the operations

277
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,560
is the secret sauce of startups and in

278
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,920
this graph

279
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,079
which i've dissected over and over and i

280
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,240
actually wrote a 2010 update to this

281
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,519
blog post which you can also find at

282
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,279
radar is

283
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,720
is essentially

284
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,360
uh the the graph represents or the the

285
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,600
colored parts of the graph represent

286
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,399
human human toil and you know some

287
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,600
people like that word or don't like that

288
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,079
word but but the idea here is that in in

289
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,480
traditional approaches to operations

290
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,440
there's much more hours of human work

291
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,800
involved

292
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,720
to get to the same kind of scale and

293
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,279
reliability where in this sort of new

294
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,600
way so this is sort of the golden age

295
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,760
you know a puppet in some of these tools

296
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
that that we can invest more

297
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,680
in some of the kind of thoughtful

298
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,320
automation around configuration and that

299
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,959
will give us a very different curve

300
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,880
in at least in terms of the the human

301
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,800
hours spent to scale

302
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
relative to the the traditional method

303
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,480
and this is uh

304
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,760
another interesting point of time so

305
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,440
2007.

306
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,600
so this is 2008 this is these are slides

307
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
i used to give when i was talking to

308
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,600
people about puppet and and you know the

309
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,519
dev and ops although we didn't call it

310
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,760
devops yet i had dev and ops in my

311
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,600
slides but we didn't call that yet so

312
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
it's like we have walls of confusion

313
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,079
between developers and operators

314
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,399
and and you know some people will argue

315
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,800
sarbanes-oxley says this and the other

316
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,720
and uh i've read every every word of

317
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,120
sarbanes-oxley if you'd like to uh have

318
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,440
that discussion that's not what it says

319
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,680
the lore is not the law uh what it

320
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,440
actually says is that you're going to

321
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,880
have controls and you're going to keep

322
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
certain promises it doesn't say that

323
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,720
developers operations can't work

324
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
together or talk together or do certain

325
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,480
things it's uh very interesting how that

326
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,680
got interpreted so the swallow confusion

327
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,839
that that we don't even see each other

328
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,040
as human sometimes in these

329
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,519
organizations we we only pass these

330
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,440
these tickets and these emails back so

331
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,959
we're kind of dehumanized makes people

332
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,000
unhappy or or even worse

333
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,839
right now i gave these exact sort of

334
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,000
slides in 2008 with the fire and

335
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,680
everything

336
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,279
and and i'll argue and i'm going to come

337
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,800
back to this that there's there's kind

338
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,880
of these two forces

339
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,720
of devanops and it's kind of two

340
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,800
different games which is uh hopefully a

341
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,200
point will make really strong um in the

342
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,040
middle but this is something that i

343
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,959
think is like forever this is like this

344
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,800
timeless conflict this core conflict

345
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,680
between

346
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,639
developers who kind of incentivize to

347
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,000
create and

348
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,920
and and innovate and that's

349
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,240
destabilizing force and then operations

350
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,560
is is sort of incentivized to stabilize

351
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,000
and keep everything

352
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,839
you know standardized

353
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,920
efficiency versus innovation so this is

354
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,079
this is a book i i helped

355
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,360
write a chapter four agile

356
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,959
infrastructure in web operations 2009

357
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,600
um and so just for the sake of kind of

358
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,839
having the conversation and

359
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,200
having interesting i'm going to call

360
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,399
everything

361
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,839
uh 2006 and and and before is before

362
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,639
cloud and then there's a space in the

363
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,920
middle and then 2009 and afterwards

364
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
we're going to call that after devops

365
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,519
and so there's this there's this point

366
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,560
in time

367
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,519
that

368
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,800
everything started becoming more

369
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,639
software driven more api driven on the

370
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,279
infrastructure and it allows us to do

371
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,600
what what kind of becomes the

372
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,079
the devops conversation so i'm going to

373
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,279
i'm going to walk through some of that

374
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,040
but first i want to kind of point out

375
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,920
that everyone wants the devops

376
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,959
but they actually don't here's here's

377
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,480
what they really want

378
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,040
but they really really want

379
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
they want scalability

380
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,399
availability

381
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,079
reliability

382
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,600
operability

383
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,279
usability

384
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,959
observability

385
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,240
all for free probably some other

386
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,120
illegals throw them in there why not

387
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,839
we'll we'll add security later

388
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,000
and and without changing anything right

389
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,560
so that that's what most organizations

390
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,720
actually want and just to make that

391
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,839
point

392
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,160
really clear i'll just make the text

393
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,399
really big

394
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,120
so

395
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,720
a lot of organizations and there's a

396
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,639
couple forces we'll talk about through

397
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,720
the through the end of this that they

398
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,800
they want

399
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,399
these these benefits but they don't

400
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,920
necessarily want to change and there's

401
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,000
reasons why that happens

402
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,839
and then just to kind of make the same

403
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,120
point i think

404
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,399
everyone would love to have great

405
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,040
security you know software enabled and

406
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,480
enforced security

407
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,399
um but they don't necessarily want to

408
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,839
change anything either

409
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,000
and that that's on both the

410
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,800
organizational aspect and in some sense

411
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,600
the the security practitioner side which

412
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,120
was this we have the same kind of

413
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,920
resistance in system administration in

414
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,839
the earliest days of a puppet or what

415
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,839
have you

416
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,040
and then there's this little problem

417
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,639
so there's

418
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,639
i i think this is a little bit of a

419
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,560
miscategorization and it's sort of funny

420
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,360
because

421
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,440
i get in conversations with my my

422
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,519
colleague john willis who now works with

423
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,399
me i read hat about how security wasn't

424
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,800
invited to like devops and i don't think

425
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,959
that's necessarily true and particularly

426
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,760
my my lens and glimpse into that is you

427
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,320
know even even from early days inside

428
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
puppet there's a lot of conversation

429
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,279
with um security-minded folks and in you

430
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,920
know highly secure environments

431
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,519
and then furthermore i think that it's

432
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,680
um

433
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,720
when you when you think about the

434
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,320
automation and some of the things that

435
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,880
were brought to bear on these problems

436
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,399
being able to kind of

437
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,199
put configurations into known desired

438
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,800
states is pretty powerful from a

439
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,399
security perspective

440
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,040
um and and then also i i would say this

441
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,959
is poured out by the data if you look at

442
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,959
the you know state of devops report and

443
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,800
accelerated whatever that that

444
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,160
the the the speed and the cycle time uh

445
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,320
speeding up actually makes it both

446
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,480
faster and safer

447
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,079
but but i think the thing you want to

448
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,199
recognize

449
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,600
and be clear about when we're talking

450
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
you know the the original kind of

451
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,800
devnops tag

452
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,720
came from this conversation about flickr

453
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,639
and so to to kind of

454
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,759
frame it

455
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,839
what i would argue is is not necessarily

456
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,240
the devops was ever really bad for

457
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,800
security it's just that a lot of the

458
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,959
conversation because of kind of the

459
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,639
nature of a few factors in the industry

460
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,480
was centered around

461
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,959
kind of this far into the spectrum where

462
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,800
the the role that you're trying to or

463
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,839
the problem you're trying to solve is

464
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,360
literally putting

465
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,519
pictures on the internet

466
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,600
like that's what flickr does

467
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,079
um and then as you move along the the

468
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,160
spectrum i think that you know you get

469
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,839
you get farther along and there's money

470
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,040
right and there's transaction there's a

471
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,120
bunch of things and now you even get

472
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
into more regulation and these other

473
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,800
things you have to deal with and then

474
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,959
and then on this far this end there's

475
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,120
kind of life and death right and there's

476
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
everything in between so

477
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,360
what is the

478
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
you know

479
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,639
responsible way to approach these

480
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,720
problems and to solve these problems

481
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,520
on one end of this spectrum

482
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,439
is not appropriate on the other end

483
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,880
right and there's kind of everything in

484
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,599
between so i think that when you have

485
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,720
rational people thinking about the

486
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,480
problem they're trying to solve and you

487
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,839
know bringing the tools and and the

488
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,760
practices to bear on the problem that

489
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,119
you're going to get something that's

490
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,880
relatively appropriate but then people

491
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,959
get kind of stuck on where they're at

492
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,280
and and again that's going to come back

493
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,760
uh more than once but this is just to to

494
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,080
frame this this thing and and for the

495
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,840
center of gravity

496
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,440
in you know especially the early

497
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,280
conversations around devops was was

498
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
definitely on this this side of the

499
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,320
spectrum

500
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,960
towards the the cats and and that's uh

501
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,120
that's okay but but there's also like

502
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,240
lots of demonstrable results um as you

503
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,400
move along the spectrum

504
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,760
and and we should take advantage of that

505
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,440
as well

506
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,480
so just a quick and and i would say i'm

507
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,799
not a security expert i've worked a lot

508
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,480
with security teams and kind of like

509
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,200
security projects but in in a lot of

510
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,360
cases a lot of organizations

511
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,400
operations is underfunded and and

512
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,919
security is as bad or worse and it's not

513
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,280
that there's not like

514
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,520
investment in it and tooling in it it's

515
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,679
just like this weird thing where

516
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,640
you know

517
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,240
it's hard to measure we'll come back to

518
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,640
that too but but it's the if if you

519
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,760
don't have

520
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,320
something where it's generating

521
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,000
the kind of revenue like that seems to

522
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,520
drive the conversation as much as

523
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,799
anything and then

524
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,400
you you set up

525
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,559
incentives with with regulation or

526
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,320
whatever and kind of like try to make

527
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,559
people do the right thing but just just

528
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,080
telling people that they shouldn't do

529
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,559
this thing doesn't necessarily make them

530
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,400
do their thing if you don't kind of help

531
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,960
them make it easy and and that will be

532
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,880
that'll be kind of like the the grand

533
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,240
finale so

534
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,480
at least reliability

535
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,000
when we talk about reliability that kind

536
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,480
of has a hope of being measurable i

537
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,160
think security is

538
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,360
it's it's not as

539
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,840
quantifiable right so there's no such

540
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,760
thing as like you're secure or you're

541
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,320
not secure as a binary in fact you know

542
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,600
most people listening this probably

543
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,960
realize that you know there's always

544
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,600
like some some level of escalation some

545
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,400
level of adversary where it's it's it's

546
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,039
harder and harder for you to to secure

547
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,280
things in that arms race but there's

548
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,200
there's kind of like the the level that

549
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,000
is

550
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,280
um

551
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,799
proportional to the risk that you're

552
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,559
exposing

553
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,000
and the adversaries that you're most

554
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,240
likely to do but reliability you can at

555
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,080
least measure you can both measure the

556
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,280
metric of the reliability and you can

557
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,600
you can sort of connect it back to

558
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,520
dollars especially if you're doing these

559
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,360
sort of you know web things where you

560
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,520
can measure everything it gets a little

561
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
a bit interesting when you're doing you

562
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,679
know embedded or crazy or device stuff

563
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,520
but

564
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,760
we so we we know we could do better you

565
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,919
know this is the this is the lesson the

566
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,360
state of devops report the data is out

567
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,039
there we know we can do better so what

568
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,799
what are we going to do like what are we

569
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,480
actually going to do

570
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,200
well there's this word buzzwordy thing

571
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,039
and you know i i've been part of this

572
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,720
community and and i'm gonna explain what

573
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,320
it means to me

574
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
and what i try to do to make it

575
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,360
actionable with with a bit of a story um

576
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
around it so this is

577
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,640
the

578
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,440
the the calms kind of mantra if you're

579
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,760
in the sort of inner circle of devopsey

580
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,880
people the the lyrium say calms or cams

581
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,320
um

582
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,640
especially the especially used to be

583
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,720
prevalent now it seems like

584
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,919
not not as many people know this or but

585
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,080
it's sort of like a test of like how how

586
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,240
up to date you are or how inside of the

587
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,880
of the circle you are so devops in this

588
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,720
context this is from a blog post that

589
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
damon edwards and john willis wrote

590
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
after the very first devops days in the

591
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,840
u.s so

592
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,280
devops

593
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,159
they they they categorize it as culture

594
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,960
automation metrics and sharing

595
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,799
and that was kind of reflecting on all

596
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,559
these conversations there's this like

597
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,039
kind of emergent community of practice

598
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,960
that we were building

599
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,240
in and that's in 2010

600
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,840
and then jazz humble

601
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,240
who some of you might know who kind of

602
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,960
has been in the same circles and wrote

603
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,280
the continuous delivery book he he added

604
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,039
that lean was probably an interesting

605
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,880
thing and so i'm going to kind of walk

606
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,360
through a little bit of this but first

607
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,039
when you say this that kind of stuff

608
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,440
like culture automation metrics and

609
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,400
sharing

610
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,600
or lean

611
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,200
like what does that mean

612
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,760
i think that's that's sort of hard to to

613
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,080
digest and then it's not necessarily

614
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
actionable so a little bit of

615
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
the rest of this and i have other talks

616
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,360
that you can kind of find on the

617
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
internet if you're so inclined to kind

618
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,520
of try to break this down maybe a little

619
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
bit more but but it's this is like an

620
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,880
attempt to kind of think about these

621
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,039
things in terms of of actionable

622
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,960
spectrums of things that are better and

623
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,480
worse

624
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,799
and also i think it's worth reflecting

625
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,559
that these things are not

626
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,400
independent and that they kind of

627
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,799
reinforce each other that that when you

628
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,720
you know you have certain culture then

629
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,120
it lead leads to better metric sharing

630
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,678
what have you

631
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,440
so culture eats strategy for breakfast

632
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,480
very famous thing i still don't know

633
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,159
what that means

634
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,760
but this is the western topology of

635
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,120
culture

636
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,799
you'll find this in

637
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,200
um it's in the devops handbook it's in

638
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,480
accelerate

639
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,760
it might it's probably in like a bunch

640
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,520
of those other books the same thing and

641
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,320
and

642
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,280
i first saw this from john all spa

643
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,720
but it's basically an interesting

644
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,840
framing has nothing to do with

645
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,280
technology has nothing to do with devops

646
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,480
is it's like

647
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,159
you know sociology

648
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,360
researcher kind of kind of categorizing

649
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,440
the these different cultures

650
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,280
and and so the thing that i hope we can

651
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,559
agree on here is that on the left side

652
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,799
the pathological

653
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,720
is not as good

654
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
as generative

655
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,080
you could tell it's not as good because

656
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,080
it's called pathological

657
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,320
and i hope we can also agree

658
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,120
that

659
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
you know if you look through this this

660
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,039
list of things here that you know low

661
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,799
cooperation probably not as good as high

662
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,159
cooperation

663
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,640
a culture where the messenger shot is

664
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,200
probably not as not as

665
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,360
collaborative as one where people are

666
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,000
sort of trained to share contextual

667
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,440
information

668
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,840
uh who wants to work somewhere where no

669
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,919
one takes responsibility who wants to

670
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,280
work somewhere

671
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,200
versus versus where the risks are shared

672
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,520
where we like understand and and have

673
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,919
risks that we all kind of agree are are

674
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,159
relevant and proportional

675
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,640
bridging is this notion of if you have

676
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,120
kind of the the the communities of

677
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,640
practice or roles inside of an

678
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,039
organization or different business units

679
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,279
are are they are they communicating with

680
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,640
each other are they sharing information

681
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,760
are they sharing context are they

682
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,360
sharing resources

683
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,840
and and hopefully i i personally would

684
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,679
rather work somewhere where bridging's

685
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,080
encouraged not where it's discouraged um

686
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,240
who doesn't like to um

687
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,559
be the scapegoat for a failure

688
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,120
versus a culture where you know there's

689
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
a failure that's a chance to learn

690
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,480
there's you know and that that's one of

691
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,559
the kind of refrains and some of these

692
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,080
some of these communities is that

693
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,520
there's there's no such thing as failure

694
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,440
as long as you're learning

695
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,520
that might not be totally true but it's

696
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,559
it's fun to say and and

697
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,080
i i'd rather

698
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,880
you know

699
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,960
we won't go there for now but

700
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,799
if you're if you have a culture where

701
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,799
novelty is crushed the chance you're

702
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,919
going to get innovation is close to zero

703
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,559
and if you have uh a culture where

704
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,960
novelty is actually implemented

705
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,799
then then the chance that you're gonna

706
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,480
be innovative is like

707
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,559
higher right that that's like this is

708
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,320
all sort of toxological in a sense but i

709
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,480
think it's an interesting framing to

710
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,520
kind of have the rest of the

711
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,840
conversation and i'm going to copy this

712
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,360
sort of three column spectrum for the

713
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,600
other things as well

714
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,440
so i'm going to move on to this kind of

715
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,279
notion of automation and i'm also going

716
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,760
to introduce architecture but there's

717
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,240
uh i i just want to give a shout out to

718
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,000
this sort of notion of control loops

719
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,840
with respect to automation because it's

720
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,159
it's essentially the central

721
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,840
um it's it's the central model for

722
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,480
the tools like puppet but then also the

723
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,799
tools like kubernetes so so

724
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,640
kind of the main difference there is in

725
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,360
the in the old model the the control

726
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,919
loop was was really checking the

727
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,720
resources that were on a certain node on

728
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,960
a single system where as you get to the

729
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,120
the newer kind of generation of

730
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,600
platforms then the the control loops are

731
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,120
basically looking at uh service and in

732
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,200
those systems you know a node is

733
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,520
essentially a resource in in those

734
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,120
services but you're going through this

735
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,200
loop where you have some declared

736
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,279
desired state you're comparing that

737
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,200
desired state to the current state and

738
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,039
then you're doing some actions you know

739
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,360
if if it's programmed properly to to

740
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,159
handle the the state that is fine

741
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,480
uh that it finds the the system and then

742
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,080
we'll try to get it back to the desired

743
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,760
state

744
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,600
so kind of going with that model that i

745
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,200
told you i would you have these three

746
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,679
columns you have automation and then i

747
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,200
also like to add architecture because

748
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,600
one of the things i came to realize

749
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,400
in in my you know struggles with

750
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,320
automation is that certain systems

751
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,360
weren't designed to be automated

752
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,520
i think that's also probably as

753
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,760
applicable to security because certain

754
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,840
systems weren't necessarily designed to

755
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,640
be secured right and and so that that

756
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,200
will um hopefully be something that kind

757
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,440
of comes out more and more as we get to

758
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,360
later in the talk but i'm going to say

759
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,039
that manual

760
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,760
is not great as great as a platform and

761
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,840
and there's a couple things to talk

762
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,120
about it's not as detailed as the

763
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,240
culture one but in in a manual um

764
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,320
approach there's basically a lot of of

765
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,720
human hours that are spent doing tasks

766
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,640
when when things are

767
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,720
failing they tend to be catastrophic

768
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,279
it's kind of like the the jenga strategy

769
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,720
and everyone's sort of focused on

770
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,120
incidents as you get better then then

771
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
there's more automation but there's

772
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
still a lot of scripting

773
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,760
and maybe people get focused on disaster

774
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,080
recovery and in that world you know

775
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,840
people are focused on the mean time to

776
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,799
recover

777
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,039
where in in the highest performing sort

778
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,520
of cloud-native version of this you have

779
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,039
the platforms they're directing the

780
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,200
architecture kind of enforcing and

781
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,679
guiding the architecture um there's

782
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,320
there's this notion of self-healing so

783
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,600
they're they're operating under

784
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
continuous partial failure and this this

785
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,159
is also a function of statistics at a

786
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,520
certain scale

787
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,919
the chance that any one component you

788
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,520
know even at the hardware level is

789
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,440
failing gets to be

790
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,840
you know pretty close to a certainty so

791
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,000
you have to be able to account for those

792
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,080
those failures or or the system will

793
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,480
come down

794
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,720
so let's let's move on to metrics and

795
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,880
this is a a quote from the borg paper

796
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
and i i think that there's this is kind

797
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,360
of i i believe a gold nugget hidden in

798
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,520
this paper and the borg is something i'm

799
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,039
going to mention at least another time

800
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,880
or two before the end of this but it's

801
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,120
the container scheduler that google used

802
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,960
to kind of build google

803
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,200
and in this paper which describes you

804
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,120
know the algorithms and containers and

805
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,880
all the scheduling stuff and kind of

806
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,279
pays homage to borg before it gets to

807
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,799
this notion of what we see with

808
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,720
kubernetes there's this little gold

809
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,039
nugget and it says almost every task run

810
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,960
under board contains a built-in http

811
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,720
server the published information about

812
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,880
the health of the task and thousands of

813
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,720
performance metrics

814
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,520
and i'm going to argue and i have i have

815
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,360
this wager that if you if you spend time

816
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,919
instrumenting your your code making it

817
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,520
you know quote unquote like the new kind

818
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,120
of term of art is observable

819
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,840
observability then you're going to get

820
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,159
more of an operational benefit from that

821
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,840
than you will from like the fanciest

822
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,960
container scheduling algorithm so

823
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,640
moving on to this this this kind of

824
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,520
spectrum again we have on one side

825
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,640
unmonitored there's not really much info

826
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,159
if you want to get information about

827
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,080
something the system you're sshing you

828
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,000
know everyone's kind of got the

829
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,919
the story or the you know there's all

830
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,919
these these monitors with the tail minus

831
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,399
f on a bunch of different terminals and

832
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,399
and marring kind of in these cultures or

833
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,159
these sort of scenarios doesn't really

834
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,640
get done it's it's you know ad hoc

835
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,440
tactically at the point of an incident

836
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,840
as you get better kind of like the the

837
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,000
middle of the road you basically have

838
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,799
uh data there's some aggregation and and

839
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,880
the metrics are secondary so it's like

840
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,360
someone writes the application and then

841
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,080
someone instruments it and adds the

842
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,720
monitoring later in the highest

843
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,200
performing organizations where where

844
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,039
observability and

845
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,960
you know this kind of notion of metrics

846
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,279
is a first-class thing then

847
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,679
instrumentation is built in by the

848
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,320
developers or or really it's provided by

849
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,159
the libraries that developers use so

850
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,559
it's actually quite easy for them so in

851
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,919
this this world you know this is where

852
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,520
you start to get slis and like some of

853
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,320
this other language from sre if you go

854
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,120
to any kind of like the high performing

855
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,880
web operation shops there's always some

856
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,520
nice big visualizations of the systems

857
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
and the state they're in and it's just a

858
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,440
first-class thing that is not something

859
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,440
added it's it's actually the the

860
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,880
developers

861
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,600
have you know embraced observability in

862
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,399
the way that they they build their stuff

863
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,799
so moving on to sharing i think there's

864
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,240
there's kind of some interesting things

865
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,960
here

866
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,240
and and you know like i said i have

867
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,520
longer form

868
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,120
talks about some of this but

869
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,799
the way i think of this problem and

870
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,080
there's there's more communities of

871
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,159
practice but you basically have um

872
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,480
communities of practice and i think you

873
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,679
know this is oversimplification too

874
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,880
because there's not one you know

875
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,360
developers are not a monolith um

876
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,640
operations there's kind of like

877
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,480
different things business the same

878
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,200
security the same but but this notion is

879
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,720
there's some notion of a community of

880
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,399
practice

881
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,240
right now people watching this and kind

882
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,480
of participating in this conference i

883
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,600
would consider

884
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,039
you know to some degree this is a

885
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,480
community of practice and you're trying

886
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,720
to bring you know shared understanding

887
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,360
and share things to this practice of

888
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,919
security and then what you want to

889
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,240
accomplish in organizations to to you

890
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,640
know serve the mission is is building

891
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,519
communities of interest that span across

892
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,519
the communities of practice and

893
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,200
we're going to get into this notion of

894
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,000
of conflicts between um two particular

895
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,240
communities of practice um and and then

896
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,600
kind of come to the end of this but this

897
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,519
is kind of an interesting framing to

898
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,760
talk about sharing so sharing going back

899
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,919
to the the three columns again you have

900
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,720
this notion of the these cultures where

901
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,399
everything's hidden everything's super

902
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,919
strong silos

903
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,720
no one shares anything um in some ways

904
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,760
that information is used against people

905
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,720
then you move to what i'll call you know

906
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,559
there's a wiki there's there's something

907
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,799
where people are trying to kind of make

908
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,240
things available but not necessarily

909
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,480
cultivated right so the highest

910
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,120
performing organizations they cultivate

911
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,320
information

912
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,919
for people to be able to make the

913
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,360
relevant

914
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,840
decision because if you just have all

915
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,440
the information all the time about

916
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,399
everything going on in organization

917
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,240
it's actually very hard to make sense of

918
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,399
and so there there has to be like some

919
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,720
notion of what's relevant and what what

920
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,519
is meaningful and then also i think that

921
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,120
there's this notion you know when you

922
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,799
look at devops and and i would say

923
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,399
devsecops and some of the stuff that's

924
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,679
emerging as practice is that we are all

925
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,519
uh solving similar problems and in the

926
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,120
sense that some of those problems aren't

927
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,600
necessarily you know differentiating us

928
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,559
then it's better for all of us to to

929
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,399
share those solutions in these global

930
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,760
communities um obviously when you get to

931
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
some corner cases of security there's

932
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,360
probably some things you don't want to

933
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,640
be totally sharing um and i'm sure

934
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,240
everyone watching this has you know

935
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,880
familiarity with some of the cvs and and

936
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,120
like the way that disclosure is done um

937
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,240
but but there is definitely this like

938
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,720
even there there's like these spiderweb

939
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,960
global community that they're sharing

940
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,519
and taking advantage of each other um in

941
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,960
in the good way right so i'm pretty

942
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,120
smart person but i would argue that you

943
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
know my ability to solve problems and

944
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,440
and add value for an organization is is

945
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,960
multiplied and magnified by the fact

946
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,519
that i built all of these connections to

947
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,279
all these other smart people who've

948
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,840
solved a bunch of problems that that i

949
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,880
don't have to solve from first

950
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,880
principles every time

951
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,559
so then moving on if you're familiar

952
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,880
with lean and the lean literature then

953
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,720
you would realize in some

954
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,080
sense liens actually kind of covered all

955
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,399
these areas in a self-contained way

956
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,080
anyway

957
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,840
we'll just ignore for a minute what a

958
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,600
terrible metaphor manufacturing is for

959
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,279
software

960
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,279
but there's one idea from from lean that

961
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,600
i really love which is this notion of

962
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,880
continuously improving and whatever was

963
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,720
was good enough today might not be good

964
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,399
enough tomorrow and that we should never

965
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,799
stop learning and never stop changing

966
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,480
and and that's also going to be

967
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
recurring theme a few times before we

968
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,559
get so just to kind of keep with the the

969
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,440
same notion of the three columns i'm

970
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,599
going to say complacent motivated

971
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,800
inspired and hopefully we can agree that

972
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,280
complacent is not as good as inspired

973
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
also i like angling because calm sounds

974
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,918
way better than cams

975
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,520
shrug

976
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,119
and also wool

977
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,399
so that's the kind of the five

978
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,280
um things that that were sort of part of

979
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,119
the original devops conversation and

980
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,639
then there's like

981
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,918
security

982
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,760
so what what does security look like in

983
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,560
this

984
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,800
and and i won't pretend like i said

985
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,879
before to be a security expert but

986
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,199
this is kind of me um

987
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,359
commenting on what i've seen as what i

988
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,199
consider kind of like the best way um to

989
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,040
do this or think about this so

990
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,960
um and and it's following along with the

991
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,599
kind of the same uh pattern so in in

992
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,640
some organizations i'd say security

993
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,560
is essentially

994
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,480
uh theatrical

995
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
and and there's just a lot of like

996
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,000
hidden information

997
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,560
and and people are

998
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,400
they they use security as a position

999
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,160
maybe to try to control behavior but

1000
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,480
they're they're not facilitating actual

1001
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,800
security they're they're just sort of

1002
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,000
hiding the the the reality of it right

1003
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,760
and then as you get better you know

1004
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,079
maybe there's some security added after

1005
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,920
the fact like we look at this thing

1006
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,520
that's going through some pipeline and

1007
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,680
we try to make it more secure we try to

1008
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,599
harden it or whatever

1009
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,200
but then in the highest performing

1010
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,599
organizations and and i think we can

1011
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,119
actually get better and hopefully this

1012
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,079
community of practice sees this and and

1013
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:44,800
is

1014
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,960
going to be the champions that make it

1015
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,680
better that that security is something

1016
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,079
that is done from first principles it's

1017
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,280
actually built in and facilitated by by

1018
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,599
the you know the libraries that are

1019
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,960
available to developer and i'm going to

1020
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,200
come back to more specifics about what i

1021
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,119
think that means and that there's a

1022
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,200
culture of ownership right so it's we're

1023
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,720
not we're not trying to blame like we

1024
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,200
we're we're trying to own security from

1025
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,800
the real sense at

1026
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,400
every layer of the organization

1027
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,920
and i don't know what the right thing is

1028
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,960
to say for that but um whatever

1029
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,520
so this is a core conflict and in some

1030
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,280
ways

1031
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,280
i've kind of retconned all of the

1032
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,160
history of devops through this lens that

1033
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,760
i'm going to share

1034
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,240
and and hopefully it will make sense

1035
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,960
because

1036
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,480
like the the wording and some of the

1037
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,640
word selection when i first when i first

1038
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,160
heard it it took me a minute to digest

1039
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
it but i'm going to try to explain it as

1040
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,839
best i can because it's it's not

1041
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,040
necessarily

1042
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,680
all from my ideas so this is this notion

1043
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,200
i already shared about the developers

1044
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,280
and the operators kind of have this this

1045
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,440
opposing force

1046
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,480
and and what what i'm gonna say now and

1047
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,920
kind of explain is that these are two

1048
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,079
different games so they're they're

1049
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,280
basically

1050
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,560
they don't understand each other because

1051
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,400
they're kind of trying to play totally

1052
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,839
different games and they're they have a

1053
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,680
totally different world view so this is

1054
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,680
someone on my team

1055
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,320
who's working on a phd at carnegie

1056
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,480
mellon specifically about how

1057
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,440
organizations change their behavior to

1058
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,320
accommodate new technology and and so

1059
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,200
this is language that that he used in

1060
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,280
his research and i'm going to use it

1061
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,720
because i i really like it and i've

1062
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,119
retconned like i said all of devops

1063
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,320
basically

1064
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,160
through this language so

1065
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,240
the core conflict that we set up and and

1066
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,240
i call it games but the the words he

1067
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,320
uses in his his research and

1068
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,800
dissertation is economy so the there's

1069
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,160
this notion of three economies and

1070
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,920
whenever i say that i'll give credit to

1071
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,280
jay because

1072
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,440
those academics get a little equity if

1073
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,800
you don't if you don't attribute their

1074
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,040
work anyway so there's there's three

1075
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,320
economies but we're going to start with

1076
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,599
two so you have

1077
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,760
differentiation and scale that's the the

1078
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,079
word that jay chose

1079
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,280
and they're kind of they're kind of

1080
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,800
disconnected from each other they kind

1081
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
of live in totally different things so

1082
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,560
one you know simple

1083
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,720
simplified version is focus on creating

1084
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,160
more value creating more novelty the

1085
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,520
other one's trying to drive down cost so

1086
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,200
then here's kind of like a bullet list

1087
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,000
of things that that like categorize the

1088
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,599
differentiation game the differentiate

1089
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,800
economy they're trying to go fast

1090
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,320
they're trying to create new things

1091
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,079
they're trying to get fast continuous

1092
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,839
feedback on experiments and they're

1093
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,359
really trying to make new stuff like

1094
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,000
this is the differentiation game

1095
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,760
and then the scale game is about you

1096
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,359
know controlling risk and capacity

1097
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,680
planning reducing variability building

1098
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,800
things that are more reliable and

1099
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,119
consolidating trying to drive down the

1100
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,520
cost through to your standards

1101
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,119
so there's this wall or the the

1102
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,480
separation right we've already kind of

1103
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,440
seen this

1104
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,520
we we we have this traditional way of

1105
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
doing this and you know there's a bunch

1106
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,920
of rules and lore that got set up

1107
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,320
it kind of forces the these two games to

1108
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,280
be against each other

1109
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,960
and i'm going to say that the wall of

1110
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,240
confusion

1111
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,040
is not understanding the game that other

1112
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,320
the other team is playing or the other

1113
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,720
side of the wall is playing

1114
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,119
and and not seeing that you're connected

1115
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,760
right to me like the the devops magic

1116
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,640
really happens when when those two sides

1117
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,800
organizations like see that they that

1118
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
they are playing the same game i also

1119
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,960
think just just a quick um i didn't i

1120
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,240
didn't have this explicitly in this

1121
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,400
conversation for this this talk but

1122
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,000
there's sort of this this change that

1123
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,920
happens when everything moves to as a

1124
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,400
service right so in in the world before

1125
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,640
as a service when software shipped on

1126
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,200
physical media operations and keeping

1127
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,359
servers alive didn't didn't really mean

1128
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,560
anything except for like people couldn't

1129
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,400
get their mail for the weekend or what

1130
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,160
have you but as you move to this this

1131
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,079
world where reliability is is is

1132
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,240
critical and everyone kind of takes for

1133
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,280
for granted that there will be

1134
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,480
reliability

1135
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,720
then then it elevates the role the

1136
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,560
operation has to play because if the

1137
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,800
servers aren't working if the services

1138
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,400
aren't up then the software literally

1139
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
doesn't exist and so so then it becomes

1140
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,480
more critical that people see that

1141
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,720
they're connected to each other

1142
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,480
so is there a way to win both of these

1143
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,320
games both of the the you know connect

1144
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,920
the innovation and efficiency game

1145
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,200
together

1146
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,000
and and i'm going to argue that there is

1147
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,680
and and to do that we kind of play a new

1148
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,560
game

1149
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,119
and this is what jabe calls the scope

1150
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,560
economy

1151
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,680
uh the the scope game right and this is

1152
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,880
like to simplify it it's about building

1153
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,880
these shared resources these shared

1154
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,160
platforms that can connect the the two

1155
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,560
other games together and keep promises

1156
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,560
to both sides

1157
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,599
so it's the scope economy in jabe's

1158
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,640
language is basically balancing the

1159
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,440
differentiation and the scale economy to

1160
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,839
kind of enable both efficiency and

1161
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,440
innovation

1162
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
and that that's this abstract kind of

1163
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,520
academic way to frame that

1164
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,319
but i think that if you if you can

1165
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,680
realize this and i'm going to try to

1166
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,680
give you some examples a minute that you

1167
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,839
you can you can win both games and the

1168
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,319
winning happens and i'll say

1169
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,800
i i will argue this is the every every

1170
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,680
devops kind of engagement that i've ever

1171
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,440
considered successful

1172
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,240
came from both sides going through this

1173
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,839
process of an ongoing negotiation

1174
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,920
between their their selfish interests in

1175
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,599
favor of the collective like seeing this

1176
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,640
bigger

1177
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,640
bigger thing they're part of

1178
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,240
and and i think that that also would

1179
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,880
apply to security and and you know some

1180
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,040
of these arguments that i'm gonna make

1181
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,800
will connect to security a minute so

1182
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
there's this notion of rebalancing the

1183
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,359
economic logic and recognizing that some

1184
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,920
things that begin as innovations in the

1185
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,160
differentiation economy are actually

1186
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,240
more valuable if they become a shared

1187
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,720
resource as part of a platform and then

1188
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,880
vice versa that there's things that in

1189
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,880
some organizations are probably being

1190
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,880
overly constrained

1191
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,480
and and that there's a way to kind of

1192
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,400
standardize the way that those are

1193
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,880
accessed and bring those into the into

1194
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,119
the scope economy as well so here's some

1195
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,920
examples some concrete examples

1196
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,160
so this is i'll just read this

1197
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,760
remove friction from product development

1198
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,280
high trust low process no handout

1199
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
between teams don't do your own own

1200
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,359
undifferentiated heavy lifting use

1201
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,200
simple patterns automated by tooling

1202
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,640
self-service cloud makes impossible

1203
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,280
things instant so this is a story that's

1204
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,920
not my words this is uh

1205
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,480
i think this is around 2014

1206
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,520
right after adrian left um

1207
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,920
netflix to go work as a vc

1208
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,440
that that he started talking about some

1209
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,240
of these lessons learned and there's

1210
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,319
some other uh bullet points but this

1211
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,160
this to me like the these are the ones

1212
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,599
that kind of describe

1213
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,280
the way that they built this shared

1214
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,000
platform that enabled them to to

1215
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,560
facilitate innovation but also you know

1216
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,240
there's there's pretty good reliability

1217
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,480
from netflix based on you know my my

1218
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,960
sampling of watching netflix so they're

1219
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,400
they're kind of keeping

1220
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
keeping both of those promises

1221
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,640
and then i'm going to argue and and i i

1222
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,640
believe i had a fairly privileged

1223
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,079
perspective to kind of watch a lot of

1224
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,480
this evolve over the last 10 years that

1225
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,240
all these quote unquote cloud native

1226
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,640
organizations built this this kind of

1227
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,880
shared platform there's some

1228
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,520
you know api driven way for

1229
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,760
developers to provision

1230
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,480
the these resources and configure these

1231
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,000
resources and interact with these

1232
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,720
resources through apis to kind of keep

1233
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,560
these promises and they really had to do

1234
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,920
that because you couldn't get to the

1235
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,040
scale

1236
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,760
that that these organizations got to

1237
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,680
with those those more traditional

1238
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,599
methods

1239
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,920
this is straight from the sre book

1240
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,359
sre builds framework modules to

1241
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,800
implement canonical solutions for the

1242
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
concerned production area as a result

1243
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,079
development teams can focus on the

1244
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,440
business logic because the framework

1245
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,880
already takes care of correct

1246
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,960
infrastructure use that's a great book

1247
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,200
site reliability engineering um the site

1248
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,839
reliability or sre workbook that's the

1249
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,040
kind of follow-up to that i wrote a

1250
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,000
forward for also a great book

1251
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,160
and and to me this you know there's

1252
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,680
other things in that book but there's

1253
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,599
snippets that are basically google

1254
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,359
describing how they built this shared

1255
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,119
platform you know this is this is the

1256
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,720
borg story so on that note i'm gonna

1257
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,839
give you homework but you didn't know

1258
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,440
you're gonna get homework from a

1259
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,160
conference keynote but um i recommend

1260
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,040
everyone in any role related to any of

1261
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,560
this stuff whether you're talking about

1262
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,280
dev ops security whatever read read

1263
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,440
these chapters from the original sre

1264
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,280
book you can read it for free i think

1265
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,960
these are gold nuggets

1266
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,359
embracing risk service level objectives

1267
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,280
eliminating toil

1268
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,119
if you've not done reading uh the

1269
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,440
communication collaboration is also good

1270
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,760
but this is this is like a framing for

1271
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,680
setting up a bunch of this other stuff

1272
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,040
um that the sre is set up to and and

1273
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,520
these aren't bad for thinking about

1274
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,079
security either so this is google's

1275
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,560
devops implementation

1276
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,560
basically they check all these boxes if

1277
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,880
you go through that book um

1278
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,119
i i would say explicitly essentially

1279
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,040
talked about each of these things in the

1280
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,119
sre book and

1281
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,280
my recommendation everyone good devops

1282
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,359
coffee great devops deal so wherever you

1283
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,599
find good good good ideas you should

1284
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,359
take them and use them

1285
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,280
so i already mentioned borg a minute ago

1286
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,400
when we were talking about the borg

1287
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,240
paper and sort of this notion of metrics

1288
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,480
and and the http servers that give you

1289
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,880
the instrumentation this is a scope

1290
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,119
economy construct that emerges at google

1291
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,280
and then kubernetes is a scoping economy

1292
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,960
construct that's sort of like you know

1293
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,599
the daughter of borg in a sense and and

1294
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,480
this is

1295
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,000
it's also kind of like mind-blowing that

1296
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,319
it's like kubernetes is a global open

1297
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,880
source commons to build the

1298
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,520
local platform commons whatever anyway

1299
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,720
moving on uh slos i i didn't explain i'm

1300
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,800
not gonna explain now but it's in the

1301
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,880
the chapters i just assigned as homework

1302
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,359
it's basically this negotiation between

1303
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,240
the sre and the software engineers that

1304
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,040
are

1305
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,880
agreeing that there's an air budget and

1306
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,119
and it changes the dynamic of the thing

1307
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,040
if you blow your air budget if you blow

1308
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
your slo

1309
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,440
then all the feature work the software

1310
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,200
engineers were going to do you know at

1311
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,800
least by the book

1312
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,800
is now going to be re-focused on

1313
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,119
reliability because we as an

1314
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,359
organization agree that reliability is

1315
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,040
important that we're not we're not

1316
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,960
getting value if we're not reliable and

1317
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,720
so the if the software development

1318
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,800
process is really creating problems with

1319
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,960
with reliability when we blow that we're

1320
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,720
going to refocus the the workflows onto

1321
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,800
reliability and this is an ongoing

1322
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,599
negotiation of of you know between the

1323
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,319
sre essentially the operations and the

1324
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,960
development functionality the the scope

1325
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,520
economy connecting the differentiation

1326
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,040
and scale economy

1327
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,720
so we have these three economies

1328
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,440
differentiation scope and scale

1329
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,119
and then there's sort of three logics

1330
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,200
that you win the games with so so

1331
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,680
differentiation wins by creating new

1332
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,839
things by creating more novelty the

1333
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,359
scope economy you win the game by

1334
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,000
creating more reuse and sharing and then

1335
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
the the scale economy you win by

1336
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,040
creating more efficiency

1337
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,440
so then in the kind of like the highest

1338
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,720
performing

1339
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,960
you know whatever devops cloud native

1340
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,920
version of this you basically have

1341
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,640
enabled value creation

1342
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,880
with these platforms that are giving

1343
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,880
self-service access with these enabling

1344
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,599
constraints to this kind of underlying

1345
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:10,400
fabric

1346
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,200
of resources

1347
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:14,800
and then this is another shout out to

1348
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,520
another carnegie mellon uh phd so this

1349
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,119
is dimeji

1350
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,839
onafuwa talking about platforms but he's

1351
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,119
not talking about tech he's actually

1352
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,920
talking about any commons or any kind of

1353
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,680
shared resource but i really like this

1354
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,440
language of recommending so platforms

1355
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,760
may be understood more conceptually as

1356
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,880
guiding principles that redefine two

1357
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,480
sides of a binary relationship that

1358
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,800
reveal the mass middle as an opportunity

1359
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,559
for innovation platforms can help us

1360
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,880
recommend resources resource management

1361
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,119
through new approaches negotiation

1362
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,800
so he's got this

1363
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,000
phd work research on this model which i

1364
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,200
think is fascinating but i didn't put a

1365
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,400
bunch of stuff here

1366
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,200
that that's sort of modeled on how a a

1367
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,160
nigerian village um which would would

1368
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,079
manage shared resources so there's this

1369
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,599
kind of notion of the tragedy of the

1370
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,920
commons very classic model for for how

1371
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,400
this goes wrong and and you know people

1372
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,400
like dimensions arguing no there's like

1373
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,880
these these great models for managing

1374
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,119
shared resources where kind of everyone

1375
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,520
can win as long as as there's some

1376
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,200
negotiation where we're willing to give

1377
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,440
up some of our more selfish interest in

1378
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,359
favor of the collective

1379
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,599
so recommending you know again i say

1380
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,200
rick condole of devops basically through

1381
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,359
this language now um and i really love

1382
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,280
it is this notion of understanding the

1383
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,559
resources

1384
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,240
that you're managing and then kind of

1385
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,400
determining where they should go

1386
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,839
how they should be managed and then

1387
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,559
moving them into into the appropriate

1388
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,079
game and helping

1389
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,000
hopefully helping everyone win win their

1390
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,240
game in the process

1391
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
so what if there's more games right so

1392
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,800
we have we we we made this divide of

1393
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,880
create more value drive down costs and

1394
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,440
then you know there's like safety

1395
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,119
security

1396
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,880
and i think this is what most

1397
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,480
organizations look like right now so you

1398
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,720
have

1399
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,880
walls of confusion

1400
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,119
and and you know maybe some

1401
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,400
bad behavior not that anyone involved in

1402
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,920
watching this would would be part of

1403
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,920
that but i i feel like i've seen you

1404
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,839
know this movie

1405
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,599
and and so what i'm kind of suggesting

1406
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,760
or are hoping people will embrace is

1407
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,760
this notion that that this this kind of

1408
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,960
shared platform that's an enabling um

1409
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,880
constraint is is the perfect place to

1410
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,760
provide the these resources that can

1411
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,200
keep promises about security

1412
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,480
and and you know why why isn't there

1413
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,040
like site security engineering and what

1414
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,599
is security engineering i think this is

1415
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,839
i i believe i'm seeing this emerge i

1416
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,359
think you know looking at some of the

1417
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,760
abstracts from this conference i think

1418
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,920
you are as well i'm not sure that this

1419
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,839
is the perfect wording or language for

1420
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,000
it yet but but i i think that we can all

1421
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,119
recognize that there's they're securing

1422
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,280
software and then there's there's

1423
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,480
software

1424
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,559
being brought to to like bear on

1425
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,079
security problems and both of those

1426
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,680
things are happening in a very

1427
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,920
interesting way right now

1428
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,240
so this is i'm just reframing the quote

1429
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,400
from the sre book

1430
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,720
hypothetically security engineers build

1431
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,559
framework models to implement canonical

1432
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,079
solutions for the concerned production

1433
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,240
area as a result development teams can

1434
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,160
focus on the business logic because the

1435
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,839
framework already takes care of security

1436
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,000
considerations

1437
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,520
that sounds like a good idea

1438
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,520
embracing risk eliminating toil those

1439
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,760
seem like great ideas for

1440
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,559
um

1441
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,880
to to approach security to to approach

1442
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,880
kind of the proportional

1443
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,119
investment in security relative to the

1444
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,359
value that's being created and and what

1445
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,119
would the what would like the

1446
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,680
security level objectives look like

1447
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,680
in an organization so

1448
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,960
coming to the end

1449
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,920
of our time together

1450
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,000
this is this is legacy me in 2010 so

1451
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,480
this is uh a blog post that i wrote

1452
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,680
there's a group of people that kind of

1453
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,079
wrote like what devops means to us in

1454
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,000
2010 and these are these are the main

1455
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,960
three points that i made at the time so

1456
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,040
devops legacy andrew in 2010 is the

1457
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,040
developers and operations can and should

1458
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,640
work together

1459
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,000
we already had the wall of confusion

1460
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,760
conversation and that kind of stuff but

1461
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,000
like let's work together

1462
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,079
common interests community of practice

1463
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,599
community of interest

1464
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,599
then the second main point was that

1465
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,119
system administration is evolving to

1466
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,960
look more like software development

1467
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,240
and in 2010 you know ec2 has been out

1468
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,359
since 2006 you have puppet you have a

1469
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,480
bunch of other kind of like emerging um

1470
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,520
monitoring things so you can basically

1471
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,640
provision configure monitor

1472
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,480
through apis and as soon as you're

1473
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,160
writing all that stuff to apis and

1474
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,960
putting all that stuff in in code and in

1475
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,359
git then that looks suspiciously like

1476
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,599
software development and we can start to

1477
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,000
use software development principles

1478
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,559
practices tools to to bring to bear on

1479
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,079
the system admission system

1480
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,160
administration problem and then last but

1481
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,160
not least and i think this is in some

1482
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,839
ways the most important at least to me

1483
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,920
and also probably my favorite is that

1484
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,319
this is all evolving together as a

1485
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,000
global community sharing solutions and i

1486
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,040
already made this point a little bit

1487
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,359
earlier but but i feel like my ability

1488
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,640
to solve problems is multiplied because

1489
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,400
i have connected

1490
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,160
myself to this global community of

1491
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,599
practice

1492
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,839
multiple different practices and and i

1493
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,720
can kind of find the right person or

1494
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,400
right group of people maybe i don't know

1495
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,280
the person but they know the person and

1496
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,040
i can i can solve problems through that

1497
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,640
global community

1498
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,319
so now forward looking 2020 me is going

1499
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,440
to argue

1500
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,800
that devsecops um developer and

1501
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,480
operations and security candidates

1502
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,520
should work together uh security is

1503
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,359
evolving

1504
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,119
it's it's involving more software

1505
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,880
development so it's i think security is

1506
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,640
getting more involved in in the software

1507
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,640
development life cycle but you're also

1508
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,839
starting to get better tools to to to do

1509
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,160
that right and there's a lot of work

1510
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,680
left to do and and hopefully that um

1511
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,440
hopefully devsecops treats you as well

1512
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,160
as devops has treated me but basically

1513
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,559
building these tools to help facilitate

1514
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,720
that to to keep stronger promises about

1515
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,559
the software to become that kind of

1516
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,599
security engineering discipline is what

1517
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,119
we're talking about here

1518
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,119
and then last but not least and i think

1519
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,440
you know a conference like this is

1520
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,359
actually making this point looking at

1521
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,960
the abstracts and the conversations i

1522
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,119
expect you're having together is that

1523
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,119
this is evolving together as a global

1524
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,119
community sharing these solutions

1525
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,079
sharing these ideas

1526
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,319
so we we live in this time this world

1527
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,960
you know that and we all basically carry

1528
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,040
these computers in our pockets so this

1529
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,119
computer that i carry with me pretty

1530
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,160
much everywhere is more powerful than

1531
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,920
all computers on the planet when i was

1532
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,720
born

1533
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,599
and it's connected to networks that you

1534
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,680
know have this incredible speed you're

1535
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,599
you're more than likely watching this

1536
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,680
video through through this high-speed

1537
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,760
network that connects it all together

1538
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,280
and it's created all these experiences

1539
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,520
we have right so we we can push buttons

1540
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,200
on these devices and people will come

1541
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,319
and get us

1542
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,440
drivers places uh we can order food we

1543
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,760
can do our finances we can do like

1544
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,200
whatever you can think of you can kind

1545
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,000
of create this digital experience around

1546
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,720
it but it's also connecting us to these

1547
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,200
adversaries right so in in a way we

1548
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,200
created all these experiences but it's

1549
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,000
also created a greater surface area and

1550
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,119
exposed um a bunch of risk

1551
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,880
and and this is what i believe so when

1552
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,200
people say software is in the world i i

1553
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,880
don't i don't think software all of a

1554
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,040
sudden got hungry i think that it's it's

1555
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,680
that aspect of the hardware the software

1556
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,359
the networks all creating these

1557
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,119
experiences and so what i feel is

1558
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,799
happening what i feel like we're

1559
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,599
watching is it and participating in

1560
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,839
building is that every aspect of human

1561
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,000
performance and experience that can be

1562
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,240
optimized will be

1563
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,640
and and and we're we're actually doing

1564
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,160
that we're like making that happen so

1565
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,559
this is also including owning you right

1566
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,559
so people there's a bit of an arms race

1567
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,160
in in this where

1568
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,319
as much as people are advancing the

1569
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,400
state-of-the-art in in one area they're

1570
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,079
advancing the state of our in in the

1571
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,400
opposite of that

1572
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,280
so this is this this is a slide i use in

1573
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,000
many talks this is andrew's definition

1574
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,960
of devops trademarked um optimizing

1575
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,559
human performance and experience

1576
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,920
operating software dun dun dun

1577
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,920
with software

1578
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,200
dun dun and humans so it's it's that

1579
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,599
human performance to me like the whole

1580
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,119
point of this is us

1581
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:46,960
humans right and

1582
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,599
being able to do software bring software

1583
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,760
to it is great but it's also really

1584
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,319
about the experience that we have and

1585
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:55,440
and and

1586
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,720
if we're having bad experience then

1587
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,640
maybe we should rethink some of it

1588
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,079
so

1589
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,520
i'm going to say the essentially the

1590
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,480
same thing

1591
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,440
for my definition of devsexop so

1592
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,160
devsecops to andrew is optimizing human

1593
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,760
performance and experience securing

1594
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,119
software

1595
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,640
with software

1596
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,359
and with humans

1597
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,359
so this is this is

1598
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:18,319
like

1599
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,160
i i hear this more than once especially

1600
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,520
it's especially funny when people are

1601
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,200
like we tried devops and it didn't work

1602
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,760
and and i just think that's hilarious

1603
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,000
and and

1604
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,680
in some ways it's hard it's hard to have

1605
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,839
a conversation because to me

1606
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,760
that that's just a silly way to frame it

1607
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,000
like devops is not it's not an actual

1608
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,920
thing right and like people get all hung

1609
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,079
up on definitions and it's like oh if we

1610
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,599
just have this right definition and all

1611
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,359
certain people could do it i don't think

1612
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,079
so

1613
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,799
so i i feel the same way when people say

1614
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,200
that they have you know devsecops like

1615
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,359
okay good job

1616
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:54,799
this is not a thing right implementing

1617
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,480
devops is not a thing

1618
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,720
implementing devsecops is nothing either

1619
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,040
devops is never done

1620
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,720
security is never done either right so

1621
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,960
there's like this ongoing thing that

1622
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,119
you've got to constantly reevaluate and

1623
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,599
improve i mean if you're checking cvs

1624
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,920
like you know what it's like

1625
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,440
there's also this resistance to change

1626
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,200
so we don't want to forget how we do

1627
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,520
things here and you see this in in lots

1628
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,880
of these practices because humans kind

1629
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,799
of attach their identity to their to

1630
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,480
their task so there's this resistance to

1631
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,440
change

1632
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,359
um and this resistance might be the only

1633
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,720
thing more inevitable than change

1634
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,240
so in

1635
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,359
the western cultures our last names are

1636
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,440
are they tend to be the vocation of our

1637
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,960
ancestor right so people have this like

1638
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,799
cultural attachment to their task and so

1639
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,240
when you change you tell people we're

1640
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,760
going to do something different

1641
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,839
like certain certain uh

1642
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,359
personalities will feel that you're

1643
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:49,280
racing their identity and and so you got

1644
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,640
to figure out a way

1645
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,200
to make them heroes in the new version

1646
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,880
of the story

1647
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,880
and they need a new loop so we have this

1648
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,960
like control loop thing about automation

1649
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,960
i think there's sort of this this mental

1650
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,040
loop that we all sort of do this is a

1651
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,520
way to give us okrs like some some

1652
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,119
organizations have these sort of things

1653
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,280
but what we really need is double loops

1654
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,000
to rethink the model to make a plan this

1655
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,119
lets us change our okrs but actually

1656
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,559
should we have okrs and and i i don't

1657
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,000
think any talk i give is complete

1658
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,160
without at least one demi quote so

1659
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,319
people with targets and jobs dependent

1660
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,319
upon meeting them will probably meet the

1661
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:27,359
targets

1662
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:28,880
even if they have to destroy the

1663
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,960
enterprise to do it

1664
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,880
edward deming

1665
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,160
so developers are under a lot of

1666
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,400
pressure to do things and they're under

1667
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,960
pressure to do things right now

1668
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,839
so we have to make doing the right thing

1669
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,559
the easy thing because if it's not the

1670
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,119
right now thing they won't do it so this

1671
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:48,559
is me

1672
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,160
on twitter ad hoc automation is a

1673
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,920
problem mastering is a solution

1674
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,920
your platform has to audit and enforce

1675
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,240
your policy

1676
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,559
and and at the appropriate risk profile

1677
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:00,480
right so this is where we get into this

1678
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,079
notion of continuous compliance

1679
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,640
continuous audit continuous enforcement

1680
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,119
um also i'll comment that when devsec

1681
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:09,040
ops is successful which i think we've

1682
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,559
already seen with with devops to some

1683
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,599
degree uh people will abuse the term

1684
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,000
marketing ruins everything and it will

1685
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,400
splinter into sub communities

1686
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,400
because infosec is not one thing either

1687
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,480
what are the infosec analogs for

1688
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,839
observability

1689
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:27,520
reliability

1690
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,400
resilience and chaos

1691
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,799
i'm not sure either but that should keep

1692
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:35,119
us all busy for at least another 10

1693
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,200
years

1694
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,280
good luck

1695
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,280
and have fun
