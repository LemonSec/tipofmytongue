ensuring the security of a few websites

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,000
or a large organization interested in

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,599
automating your web vulnerability

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,000
assessment and management acunetix is

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,640
here to help

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,000
all right uh welcome uh my name is frank

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,400
and i'm here to talk to you about a

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,320
ocean to compromise a journey to social

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,640
engineering and to give you a little bit

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,400
more about what happens in social

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,320
engineering but this time to bring it

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,160
all the way to the from the beginning to

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,559
the end

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,280
we're going to be following what's kind

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,399
of called the what's called the uh

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,879
lockheed martin kill chain so

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,879
we're going to start off with recon

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,800
weaponization delivery exploitation

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,000
installation

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,520
command and control and then

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,719
exfiltration of the actual data uh

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,399
however we're going to be talking about

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,719
the entire process both the red team and

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,760
the blue team in this

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
okay

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,720
so one of the things that we're going to

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,119
be using is called osint tools

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,799
one of the very first steps in the test

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,560
is to do the reconnaissance phase and i

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,439
actually love the reconnaissance phase i

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,840
like to spend a lot of time with this

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,920
and the problem though is that i also

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,960
like to watch reconnaissance videos

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,479
and the problem that i see with a lot of

39
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,400
these is that they show you how to use

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,920
the tool but they don't take it all the

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,000
way through hey here's your ocean here's

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,920
what you can grab now you have the day

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,759
to do something with it i'm actually

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,119
going to take you through this entire

45
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,520
journey

46
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,880
you know the reason why sometimes after

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,399
learning a tool you ever feel like this

48
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,920
like you just want to jump on top of a

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,280
giraffe and jump and look at this so

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,280
okay

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,399
we're gonna be talking about is an

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,719
end-to-end process we're gonna cover the

53
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,880
more overall piece

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,479
it may seem that i'm going all over the

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,079
place with this presentation if you

56
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,600
think that then you are definitely

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
correct

58
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,680
i'm gonna start off with social

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,119
engineering but it's not just about

60
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,800
testing people we're also testing the

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,639
technical controls

62
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,800
this is not a tools presentation as i'll

63
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,480
be talking about process

64
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,680
but this is also not a process

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,200
presentation as we'll be talking about

66
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
the output of the tools and how to use

67
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,640
that tools for the input for your next

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,720
step a lot of times when we look at the

69
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,400
road to penetration testing it often

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
looks like this where it's all over the

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,480
place which way can we go this is

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,640
actually what makes pen testing very

73
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,440
very difficult

74
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,400
okay

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,760
before we get started let's start on the

76
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,280
legal portion

77
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
make sure that social engineering is

78
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,879
covered in the rules of engagement and

79
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,480
in the scope of work

80
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,239
are you allowed to review the social

81
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,000
media people

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,920
keep in mind that i am not an attorney

83
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,760
and more importantly i am not your

84
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,360
attorney

85
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,879
some things to consider

86
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,040
does the company own the email addresses

87
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,920
and uh names associated with the company

88
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,200
99 of the time that's going to be a yes

89
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,959
does the company have a responsibility

90
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,200
for what the employees post if they are

91
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,040
associated with the company and they are

92
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,959
saying they are part of the company

93
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,560
are they responsible for what's going

94
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,519
out what what they're putting out there

95
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,120
what are the terms and the services of

96
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,319
the social media site whether you're

97
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,480
talking about facebook linkedin

98
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,640
uh any other social media sites what are

99
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,279
their rules

100
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,879
and one of the things that you'll have

101
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,720
to really take consideration is why did

102
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
you sing a single out an employee or a

103
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,040
single set of employees this can get

104
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,080
into some very deep uh hr issues if

105
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,040
you're not very careful

106
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,400
right

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,319
uh well that's all covered cover some

108
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,920
definitions if you don't happen to know

109
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,080
ocean open source intelligence is data

110
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,840
collected from publicly available

111
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,560
sources and intelligence content we all

112
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,159
know that there's tons and tons of

113
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,239
information out on the internet ocean is

114
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,760
the ability to go out there and grab

115
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,920
that information and be able to see

116
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,879
what's out there publicly

117
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,680
compromise uh violation of a security

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,920
policy which an unauthorized intentional

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,480
or unintentional disclosure modification

120
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,640
discuss destruction or loss of an object

121
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,799
may have occurred essentially that you

122
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,640
have been uh

123
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,720
you have an incident which is the next

124
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,079
definition

125
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,680
and someone has gotten into your system

126
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,320
now the difference is at least as what i

127
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,800
see is between a compromise and a breach

128
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,240
is that a breaches means that they've

129
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,080
actually were able to exfiltrate the

130
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,479
data and they've now found the data on

131
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,400
some other type of source sources that

132
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,919
are not owned by the company

133
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,199
so the first tool that we're going to

134
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,919
cover is called maltego now teego is an

135
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,680
open source intelligence and forensics

136
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,479
tool developed by pantera

137
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,040
right uh they focus on transform they

138
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,520
focus on a graphical format

139
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,479
and

140
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,240
they like to have a lot of modules

141
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,560
inside multigo i'm only going to use one

142
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,160
so i'm going to play a video here me

143
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,240
using it

144
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,400
this is called the demo the company

145
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,880
stalker

146
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,880
and in here this is of course the free

147
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,160
edition this is run off of kali linux

148
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,880
and i'm going to go ahead and run this

149
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,080
right

150
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,360
and of course i'm going to sit there and

151
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,280
i'm going to log in

152
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,360
uh went ahead and skipped past that i

153
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,240
don't want to give out my username

154
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,840
right

155
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,360
and what i'm going to do is that it's

156
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,720
now sitting there updating its data

157
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,479
right it's going to go ahead and start a

158
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,120
blank graph

159
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,320
and then what i'm going to do is up in

160
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,639
the top i'm going to click on uh the

161
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,600
maltego symbol

162
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,800
all right

163
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,080
and i'm gonna go ahead and choose

164
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,160
company stalker

165
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,000
and the company stalker is essentially

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,360
i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna put in

167
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,880
a company name

168
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
uh it's gonna go out to their public

169
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,840
website and start start building a

170
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,520
graphical type of interface

171
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,039
of the data that it can find

172
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,600
so as i run the tool

173
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,199
the tool is sitting there building this

174
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,120
graphics and

175
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
since i'm working on the company stalker

176
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,520
it's looking for email addresses very

177
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,880
specifically email addresses

178
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,360
and of course that tells me the person

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,880
that i'm trying to communicate with or

180
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,400
the person that i'm going to target

181
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
when i take the data i'm going to go

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,599
ahead and pull the data out of the email

183
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,000
addresses um in this case you can see

184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,720
the the format right

185
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
could this be the way that the usernames

186
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,400
are formed now this is not the way that

187
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,639
you'll actually see the data in order to

188
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,080
protect everyone involved with this

189
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,240
presentation i've shortened the last

190
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,919
name to three letters

191
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,599
and obviously it's

192
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,240
not the companies not the company right

193
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,319
uh in this what we're going to do is

194
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,599
we're going to put take the data from

195
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,880
this and put it into the number one

196
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,039
favorite tool the penetration testers

197
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,759
microsoft excel

198
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,440
okay

199
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,720
we've taken the data we put it into

200
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
microsoft excel now we're going to also

201
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,400
take one of the names that are off that

202
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,919
list and we're going to check all the

203
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,599
social media sites with

204
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,919
a sherlock is an open source ocean tool

205
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,000
that takes a username and checks for

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,960
checks for other social media sites

207
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,479
right

208
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,960
uh the tool is found over on the github

209
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,840
site

210
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,880
and

211
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,080
if you want to learn i'm going to show

212
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,280
you the tool but if you want to learn

213
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,039
more about the tool uh there's a

214
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,520
gentleman named nullbyte out on youtube

215
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,840
and he actually has done some great work

216
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,119
on how to use this tool

217
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,120
so

218
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,639
this is a demo of sherlock right off of

219
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,360
kelly linux

220
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,080
so i'm going to go ahead and run the

221
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,318
tool

222
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,759
and in the tool what is actually doing

223
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,680
is now looking through all these social

224
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,160
media sites trying to find that name

225
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,039
everything from facebook from ebay

226
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,960
anything along that same name so that we

227
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,360
can try to build a great profile

228
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,680
for this person

229
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,879
it's going to pause a little bit

230
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,479
facebook takes a little bit for it to go

231
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,400
through

232
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
right

233
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,120
it's now going to sit there and it's

234
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,320
going to look through all these

235
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,640
different social media sites

236
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,679
so on the results of sherlock

237
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,440
we can see that we have a lot of data

238
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
now one of the things that i did was i

239
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,800
went through and i saw a lot of the

240
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,240
investing sites

241
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,160
and if you go to the person's web

242
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,080
facebook page here

243
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,640
you can actually see that they live off

244
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,200
out of the country and they're involved

245
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
a lot with money if you were to scroll

246
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,040
down on this facebook site they were

247
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,760
involved with a ton of money right

248
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
so what kind of stuff are they going to

249
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,000
be susceptible to for a compromise

250
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
attack

251
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,080
right

252
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,200
we're going to go ahead and spearfish

253
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,839
this guy so the graph that i have here

254
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,600
you can see is

255
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,200
what is the anatomy of a spearfishing

256
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
attack you know we're going to target

257
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,040
social networks and target a company

258
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,600
we're going to follow the social trail

259
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,120
uh we're going to use a email address

260
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,959
right email's passed through the sam

261
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,200
spam filter hopefully right

262
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,240
open by the sender a link is clicked

263
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,680
and then the hacker uses the back door

264
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
to test the information so let's put

265
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,880
that into practical use now

266
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,440
all right how do we build a good fish

267
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
you know what kind of fish do we want to

268
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,279
send to this person from the social

269
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,959
media that we did we can tell that this

270
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,560
person's a vp

271
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,720
right um he's probably not going to take

272
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
a directive style of phishing he's not

273
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,279
going to sit there and go hey go do this

274
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,200
he's going to be all about information

275
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,480
that he can use and consume right so

276
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
maybe a statement but how do we build a

277
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,040
convincing one how do we learn about

278
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,720
what kind of

279
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,680
data

280
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
would this person want to be attacked

281
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,040
with

282
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,760
right well we used google directives or

283
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,079
as i like to call them google dorky

284
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,240
right everyone knows google

285
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,800
uh we're gonna use uh google directives

286
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,519
to find a pdf from a legitimate site

287
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,000
so what we're gonna do is we know that

288
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,839
this person you know the original target

289
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,320
was schwab.com so we're going to go into

290
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,640
google we're going to type in site colon

291
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,360
schwab.com

292
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,120
and then file type colon pdf

293
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
and what this will do is find all the

294
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,959
pdfs that are off of schwab.com

295
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,959
we can then sit there and look at what

296
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,839
kind of files are coming from

297
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,920
schwab.com pdfs

298
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,839
and that way we can make it a better

299
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,959
more convincing fish

300
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,880
right

301
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,120
so when i go ahead and do this i went

302
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,959
ahead and did the site colon

303
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,360
i downloaded the pdf as well use it as

304
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,959
part of the next step

305
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,880
okay and if you ever need a little bit

306
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,839
more information on google dorking it's

307
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,279
googleguide.com

308
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,279
advancedoperatorsreference.html

309
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,120
okay

310
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,640
we're now going to move on so we now

311
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,959
have the pdf we have the profile of the

312
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,959
user now we're going to use a social

313
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,519
engineering toolkit by trustedsec uh

314
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,519
it's written by dave kennedy the founder

315
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,480
of trustedsec and it's going to be a

316
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,399
python driven tool aimed at penetration

317
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,800
testing

318
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,720
okay

319
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,560
when we do social engineering right or

320
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,640
proper social engineering we'll need a

321
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,399
couple of different architectures here

322
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,680
so if you can look at the graphic uh

323
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,440
we have our mail server

324
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,240
we're going to try to deliver the mail

325
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,160
through the corporate mail server

326
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,519
over to the user

327
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,279
and then the user is going to sit there

328
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,519
and hopefully click on the link and then

329
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,920
it's going to try to run a script that

330
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,720
will now egress out to a different type

331
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,839
of host um i would suggest putting this

332
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,040
into someplace public like aws azure

333
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,240
google cloud be sure to test and read

334
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,480
their terms of service to make sure that

335
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,399
you are not violating any terms of their

336
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,399
service

337
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,639
okay

338
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,040
so uh in order to build this i'm going

339
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,639
to go ahead and show you how to use the

340
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,360
social engineering toolkit

341
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,519
okay so i start with mfs console

342
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,040
okay and as i start the console here

343
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,839
i got now metasploit

344
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,120
right and i'm going to write in there

345
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,399
use exploit windows file format adobe

346
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,399
pdf

347
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,040
as i sit there i run it

348
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,920
right

349
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,839
it's gonna now sit there and configure

350
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,839
it i'm gonna now type show options

351
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,079
and now in the file name of course

352
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,000
you're gonna see here is that this is my

353
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,720
lhost my listening host that's where we

354
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
actually want to move that over to the

355
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,760
cloud so we want to create the listening

356
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,040
host we're going to change the ip

357
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,160
address to a cloud server or a server

358
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,320
that we have out in the cloud

359
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,240
i'm now going to hit run

360
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,600
and it's now created the evil dot pdf

361
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,279
right

362
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,360
i would suggest uh when we actually go

363
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,120
to the delivery of this portion that you

364
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,519
change it from ebill pdf i'm going to

365
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,920
assume that most users uh

366
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,720
are not going to train and use and click

367
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,360
on something called evil

368
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,399
right now how do we deliver this

369
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,720
we can now send this via email right

370
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,000
with the work you've done you know how

371
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
to build a good ruse

372
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,040
right we know what this person's looking

373
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,360
for they're looking for financial data

374
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,199
they were a vice president so they're

375
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,040
not going to take a directive but they

376
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,120
may take things like a statement

377
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,720
you may not want to send it if you do

378
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,000
send it you may not want to send it over

379
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,600
a gmail account

380
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,440
gmail has this horrible thing of

381
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
stripping out malware and makes it

382
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,079
harder for pen testers

383
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,240
obviously in the pandemic that we're in

384
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,920
you may not have physical access but if

385
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,079
you do there's always usb drops

386
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,720
or if you happen to be in

387
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
the same vicinity of the person

388
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,160
have a usb

389
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,440
and then sit there and ask them to print

390
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,519
something can you print this can you

391
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,680
open up this pdf for me which will then

392
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,800
initiate the malware and send it out

393
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,480
right and then of course you can also

394
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,839
send some of this data through social

395
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,800
media platforms

396
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
okay

397
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,399
where do we measure success now right i

398
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,839
mean a lot of times when you look at the

399
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,639
red teams you sit there and go oh well

400
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,399
he never hit the listening point

401
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,199
so we weren't very successful

402
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,399
possibly right um you know

403
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,079
if it is if you did hit the listening

404
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,279
port you know from a red team

405
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,600
perspective you know do you have to grab

406
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,160
the c2 from the user's laptop did the c2

407
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,079
actually work right

408
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,480
uh make sure that when you know a user

409
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,480
takes email

410
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,240
what did they check the email on did

411
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,680
they check it from their laptop do they

412
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,519
check it from their phone did they check

413
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,680
it from their tablet how many devices

414
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,600
have do you have to just check your

415
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
email

416
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,720
you know but this is not just a red team

417
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,399
presentation this is also a blue team

418
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,399
presentation so

419
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,600
if you did

420
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
get anything on listening for it

421
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,040
what stopped you

422
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,600
right was it the user did the user

423
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,680
actually report this phishing email to

424
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,320
whatever process that you have

425
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,920
did the email catch the attachment did

426
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,480
the user not even get the attachment

427
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,199
right if the user did click on the link

428
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,440
did your endpoint protection was in

429
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,320
place and did it respond did it stop it

430
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,079
if your endpoint protection didn't stop

431
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,720
it

432
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,560
did the dlp stop the egress

433
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,600
right

434
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,120
