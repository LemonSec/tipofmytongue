1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,439
i'm jc hertz i have been

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,279
fighting to make

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,879
the public sector and critical

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,040
infrastructure safe for open source for

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,360
about 15 years

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,000
a lot of that involves incredibly

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,880
unglamorous discussions in rooms with no

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,800
natural light

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,520
to keep large corporations from

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,800
convincing

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,720
the department of defense that open

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,480
source is illegal

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,840
and against federal acquisition

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,679
regulations so there's been a lot of

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,399
lawyering a lot of policying

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,360
through the last decade and a half

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,760
and the success of open source in

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,520
critical infrastructure

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
stands as a testament to the efforts of

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,920
a lot of people

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,640
in some really really big

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,199
very dense bureaucracies

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,680
to advocate for open source

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,559
and this includes not only defense

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,079
and national security but also energy

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,600
health care

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,960
telecom

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,680
and a lot of the sectors that i like to

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,159
categorize in preventing the zombie

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,880
apocalypse right the things that

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,960
if they fall

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,840
we're all going to be in a very very bad

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,600
place

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,960
so

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,840
the focus in decade and a half ago was

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,720
about

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,560
code composition

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,320
and was there any gpl in open source

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,439
and

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,520
the shift to vulnerability management

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,040
was okay well is there anything

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,079
vulnerable

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,920
in this stuff

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
and a lot of the more highly regulated

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
sectors demanded more transparency of

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,280
their

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280
suppliers because again

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,920
zombie apocalypse

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,119
and now

50
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,200
the focus

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
is beginning to shift from software

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,159
composition analysis which software

53
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,560
composition analysis you're welcome the

54
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,479
industry has has a lot of revenue

55
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,200
because of some of these changes but now

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,040
it's about suppliers

57
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,159
it's about what are the organizations

58
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,360
and maintainers of these capabilities

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,480
and are they reliable or is there risk

60
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
in there

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
and it's not just the the open source

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,319
development uh it's all of the companies

63
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,560
that take those capabilities and wrap

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,280
them up and bundle them and deliver them

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
into power plants or into telecom

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,440
infrastructure or into a defense program

67
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,480
so

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,440
this talk is really to tee up how that

69
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,480
risk calculus is shifting

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,440
how

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
the transparency initiatives that are

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,080
being pushed by regulators are working

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,800
their way through a very complex

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,519
multi-tier supply chain

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,800
that goes from an open source project

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,959
through to a

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,720
app developer

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
to an integrator

79
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,800
to a customer and maybe to an

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,599
international partner

81
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,319
and the difficulty of that transparency

82
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,760
initiative

83
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,519
and why it matters to the open source

84
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,040
community

85
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,640
so

86
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,239
where i work in the high assurance world

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,200
there's

88
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,280
typically a lot more regulation that

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,599
exists because of governments

90
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,959
and because of industry best practices

91
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,239
so there's

92
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,560
non-voluntary mandates

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,840
and there's also a logistics issue so my

94
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,159
company focuses on software logistics

95
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,680
and making sure that

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,480
software can securely move around

97
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,440
from

98
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,680
the end-to-end process of the open

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,000
source community to that subcontractor

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,159
to contractor to customer to a different

101
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,120
network

102
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,920
and how to keep it continuously assured

103
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,080
and one of the big differences there and

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,000
this is also the case in healthcare and

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,840
finance and energy

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,200
is that you don't have a direct

107
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,560
connection

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
to the internet at all times

109
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,640
right these things exist on networks

110
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,280
that may not be connected there's great

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,439
reasons not to directly connect your

112
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,760
power plan to the internet and so we

113
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,519
have to solve these transparency

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,280
problems and these

115
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,560
supply chain risk management problems

116
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,238
in discontiguous environments

117
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,520
so open source

118
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,680
15 years ago it was the rebel alliance

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,280
and people were talking about how open

120
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,000
source is a is like a free puppy right

121
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,960
well

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,840
the puppy grew up

123
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,800
part of this focus on supplier risk and

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,639
supply chain risk management is actually

125
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,880
the victory of open source right open

126
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,479
source is so big and so pervasive

127
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,000
and so vital

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
to all these enterprises

129
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,280
that the inevitable risk calculus goes

130
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,400
towards

131
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,600
okay so who's maintaining this stuff

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,720
um this is my actual dog

133
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,919
i spend a lot of money on premium

134
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,240
grain-free dog food every month for two

135
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,280
mastadors mastiff labrador combinations

136
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,400
so these things are resource intensive

137
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,600
open source if it's going to be a true

138
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,240
enterprise capability and and truly what

139
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,000
we rely on

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,960
is resource intensive we all run our own

141
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,120
operation and maintenance of it

142
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,960
and we want that maintenance to be

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,720
performed well

144
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,840
and this is what is shifting the

145
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,560
visibility towards suppliers and whether

146
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,720
the people who develop capabilities and

147
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,880
incorporate open source components are

148
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,360
actually doing a good job as suppliers

149
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,680
there's also

150
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,280
a threat landscape which has changed

151
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,960
so we see dependency attacks

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,440
we see repo hijacking we say typo

153
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,120
squatting and these are all things that

154
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,000
companies and automation platforms and

155
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,440
analysts who look at supplier risk

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,039
are paying attention to

157
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,639
right these are

158
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,880
supply chain attacks that are launched

159
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,840
that don't necessarily have to do

160
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
with code composition and whether you've

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,560
got the right license in there

162
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,479
a lot of them have to do with actions in

163
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,880
the supply chain

164
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,400
there's also a

165
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,759
a much more robust kind of actor

166
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,160
that wants to launch supply chain

167
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,639
attacks so we have state actors at work

168
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,080
and this plays out in the realm of

169
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,639
foreign relations foreign policy cyber

170
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,560
war

171
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,520
and that's more than a lot of

172
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,000
the regulated enterprises can really

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,280
handle

174
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
manually

175
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,759
and so we we see the threats escalating

176
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,000
and we've just seen some really

177
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,599
egregious

178
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,639
state actor breaches

179
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,440
and so we really have to start to look

180
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,639
at

181
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,039
whether the people who are maintaining

182
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,800
capabilities

183
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,599
are doing a good job

184
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,680
being stewards

185
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,080
of critical infrastructure

186
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,479
right so you start to see a lot of what

187
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,400
we call these the dreaded flow down

188
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,919
provisions

189
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,199
right is that some regulated customer is

190
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,520
subject to a mandate

191
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,560
that says

192
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,880
you have to be a super responsible

193
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,120
steward or at least do some compliance

194
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,520
paperwork to a test that you are

195
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,960
and you're going to make everybody

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,319
underneath you do the same thing and

197
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,440
you're going to put it in all your

198
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
contracts

199
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,479
and so

200
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,879
it's the customer's customers customers

201
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,440
provision that ultimately affects

202
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,400
some two to five person company

203
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,039
right that doesn't have all this

204
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,120
compliance infrastructure

205
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,680
so you know security rolls downhill at

206
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,560
least

207
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
i think that's what the s is supposed to

208
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,639
stand for

209
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,319
and you see these mandates coming down

210
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,199
and so you have things like an fda

211
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,879
requirement that says

212
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,199
well if you want regulatory approval for

213
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,720
a medical device

214
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,080
you're going to have to submit a

215
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,160
software bill of materials and i'm proud

216
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,919
to say i worked on some of the language

217
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,919
that was referenced

218
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,280
by the fda in this regulatory guidance

219
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,440
at the department of commerce the ntia

220
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,679
effort on software transparency

221
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,760
but that's becoming table stakes right

222
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,519
software bill of materials show me

223
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,039
what's in your stuff that's not your

224
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,880
special sauce if you want a medical

225
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,040
device because none of us

226
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,080
want

227
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,279
a compromise of people's pacemakers or

228
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,800
cat scanners

229
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,240
or any of the things that operate around

230
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,600
in or on

231
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,040
a human being

232
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,680
in a medical situation

233
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,240
anything with safety considerations is

234
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,399
going to follow suit and we've already

235
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,560
started to see this in

236
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,920
you know an energy and in automotive

237
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,240
a lot of the iot discussions are around

238
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,920
this but even just in the straight-up

239
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,399
software supply chain

240
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,279
there's a regulatory regime called cmmc

241
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,000
anyone who's already heard about it or

242
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,800
read about it is is going to be probably

243
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,959
covering their eyes right now but

244
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,880
it has to do with

245
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,920
proving

246
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,800
to a regulator that you are being

247
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,440
vigilant in the protection of your data

248
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,120
and there's a whole bunch of stuff in

249
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,880
here that's not really about software

250
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,160
scanning

251
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,920
um it really has to do with your

252
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,519
behavior as a supplier and it affects a

253
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,040
lot of companies

254
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,959
and they're subcontractors and it's like

255
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,600
the old shampoo commercial you know and

256
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,680
they required it of two suppliers and

257
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,920
they required it of two subcontractors

258
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,760
and so on and so on

259
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,000
and it scopes out to a lot of

260
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,839
organizations many of which are small

261
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,279
firms that are not necessarily

262
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,480
capitalized

263
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,000
to do huge amounts of compliance

264
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,959
um nist national institute for standards

265
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,440
and technologies has a new revision of

266
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,000
its 853

267
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,839
regulatory or standards about cyber

268
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,240
vigilance and cyber security that

269
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
includes a lot of supply chain risk

270
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,920
management controls

271
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
and you may not be

272
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,880
directly affected by these things

273
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,959
but someone who uses your software

274
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,640
probably is

275
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,399
there's executive orders

276
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,560
and you know presidents write them all

277
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,000
the time

278
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
but when it comes to some of these

279
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,279
supply chain risk management and

280
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,800
supplier

281
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,040
executive orders

282
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,839
these things are difficult to unwind

283
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,600
even if an administration changes

284
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,560
there are steps that get put into place

285
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,200
and risk decisions that are made that

286
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,000
are very difficult to walk back

287
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,640
and this is not just the united states

288
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
so there are similar initiatives that

289
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,519
are going on in europe in japan and

290
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,399
elsewhere every country

291
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,800
with critical infrastructure

292
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,360
has justifiable reasons to be really

293
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,399
worried

294
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,120
right now about hostile actors

295
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,360
and their efforts to take critical

296
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,839
infrastructure

297
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
offline and so that's what's driving a

298
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,600
lot of this as well internationally

299
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,120
now in terms of open source

300
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,560
people who develop open source

301
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,720
capabilities of which there are many

302
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,200
great capabilities and where a lot of

303
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,600
great innovation has come from comes

304
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,200
from and will continue to come from

305
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,519
tend to put their own efforts in the

306
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,360
context of a commercial software world

307
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,160
of a huge open source ecosystem

308
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,279
of an academic ecosystem

309
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,920
but the thing about open source as a

310
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,600
flow

311
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,480
is that it goes to a very very complex

312
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,600
supplier ecosystem right so

313
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,240
anyone who builds code is

314
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,440
usually pulling in dependencies

315
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,760
they're passing that

316
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
assembly of their own code and somebody

317
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,399
else's code along to someone else

318
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,639
that entity may be passing it along to

319
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,560
someone else

320
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,279
and so this really really goes beyond

321
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,760
kind of effect dev ops

322
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,320
right and first party development of

323
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,839
something you're going to deploy

324
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,320
yourself

325
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,920
into the whole notion of a supplier

326
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,120
ecosystem and a supply chain

327
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,519
where there are discontinuities at every

328
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,519
step along the way

329
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,720
and where there may be kinds of risks

330
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,079
that your

331
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,000
application scanner

332
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,920
or your uh

333
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,399
system system security planning your

334
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,720
first party entity might not be picking

335
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,639
up so we all need to think harder

336
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,200
about these ecosystems

337
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,680
and how do i as a maintainer or as a

338
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
consumer

339
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,279
of an open source capability

340
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,680
start to get at better

341
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,000
provenance and pedigree for what i've

342
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,800
got

343
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
so that i can prove it to the next

344
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,480
person and hopefully they can prove it

345
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,360
to the

346
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
entity after that it takes delivery of

347
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,240
that capability

348
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,200
so con annuity

349
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,800
there's a lot of focus on secure devops

350
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,880
securing the pipeline sas in the

351
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,000
pipeline break the build all that is

352
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,680
amazing

353
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,199
but it doesn't actually solve the supply

354
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,040
chain problem

355
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,440
so in many cases there's a it's a kind

356
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,600
of a lamp post problem right people are

357
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,120
looking under the lamp post because

358
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,399
that's where

359
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,399
they would see the keys not where they

360
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,720
lost their keys to where they lost their

361
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,800
keys and this is a graphic from breaking

362
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,639
trust which is the atlantic council

363
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,800
report that that came out

364
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,120
this relatively recently which is

365
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,519
phenomenal and an incredible

366
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,760
piece of work but there are so many

367
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,360
places

368
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,720
in the supply chain where compromise can

369
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,839
happen

370
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,880
right so you have supply chain attacks

371
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,240
that happen

372
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,360
in the the source code repositories you

373
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,040
have package managers you have sdks

374
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,839
you have there's so many

375
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,440
different places in the supply chain

376
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,000
that are not the repo

377
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,279
and that are not the build pipeline

378
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,920
where things can be compromised

379
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,399
and this is why suppliers and supplier

380
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,399
vigilance is important that's why

381
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,399
transparency is important

382
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,880
and it's where suppliers are going to

383
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,360
want proof

384
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,240
that what they're taking delivery of is

385
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,880
actually what it says it is

386
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,600
and what happened to it along the way

387
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,959
and

388
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,600
this is all being clocked so i can say

389
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,959
this because

390
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,760
i do this every day

391
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
the times

392
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,800
it takes

393
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,920
for

394
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,880
the remediation of issues

395
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,440
by suppliers the detection

396
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,800
the repair

397
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,000
the delivery to update

398
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,600
we clock all that stuff and so when

399
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,839
a supplier

400
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,720
has a capability in which there is a

401
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,519
newly published vulnerability

402
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,680
and they're under continuous monitoring

403
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,600
as a supplier the customer knows

404
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,000
and there's a stopwatch

405
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,320
and so the time it takes the supplier to

406
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,440
detect

407
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,560
fix and update that capability

408
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,199
that goes into their supplier risk score

409
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,440
because there are certain suppliers

410
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,920
that are very responsive

411
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,199
right maybe they're doing their sec

412
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,959
devops they find something they do a

413
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,800
dependency update they have a very low

414
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,199
level of technical debt

415
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,199
and they ship an update to their

416
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,440
customers quickly

417
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,800
or they alert their customers that an

418
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,040
update is available

419
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,079
there are other suppliers

420
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,279
that

421
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,680
may not be building their capabilities

422
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,880
every day

423
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,800
and most capabilities aren't built every

424
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,880
day at some point there's a life cycle

425
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,399
where things aren't being built every

426
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,240
day

427
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,040
they

428
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,240
take a long time to fix things because

429
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,279
fixing things isn't fun

430
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,600
and then when they

431
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,120
ship a new release is anybody's guess

432
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,839
so we've seen the remediation times for

433
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,720
suppliers in critical infrastructure

434
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,800
vary from

435
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,079
hours

436
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,240
to

437
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,399
the better part of a year

438
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,240
and it could be longer that's just how

439
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,319
long we've been longitudinally measuring

440
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,439
them

441
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,640
so

442
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,079
this starts to

443
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,079
this starts to factor

444
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,559
right if something goes wrong

445
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,359
how long is my supplier gonna take

446
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,000
to detect it to fix it and to get me a

447
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,160
remediated update

448
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,919
and that's all being measured now so it

449
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,720
can be managed

450
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,240
so

451
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,400
maintenance

452
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,640
maintenance is not glamorous it's not

453
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,440
sexy it's not fun

454
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,240
but

455
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,160
maintenance is the biggest source of

456
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,280
supplier risk

457
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,919
typically when we have a customer in

458
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,840
critical infrastructure and we're doing

459
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,200
out-of-band monitoring on the

460
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,120
composition of a supplier capability it

461
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,640
could be a contractor it could be a

462
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,840
vendor it could be open source component

463
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,360
and uh

464
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,880
there's a finding

465
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,600
that puts the enterprise at risk

466
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,840
and a communication back to the supplier

467
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,679
there's a lot of we'll put it in our

468
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,600
backlog

469
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,840
right and um oftentimes vendors

470
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,080
they don't want to know

471
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,160
they do a lot to avoid reading the

472
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,400
findings

473
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,600
and

474
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,679
that's just

475
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,160
past the point of being acceptable for

476
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,120
critical systems

477
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,799
there's a little bit of an information

478
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,240
theory wrinkle here too

479
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,120
because there's a very very

480
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,679
fine line and and

481
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,000
pretty much a blur

482
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,600
between

483
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
failure to maintain

484
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,679
intentional failure to maintain gross

485
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,960
negligence

486
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,200
and sabotage

487
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,919
so

488
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,919
one of the interesting things about

489
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,080
certain findings about certain systems

490
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,120
that are so badly maintained

491
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,440
that they're exploitable

492
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,799
is that there's no way to prove

493
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,240
that a supplier intentionally

494
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,280
failed to maintain their system in a way

495
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,919
that they knew how to exploit

496
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,160
right plausible deniability it's

497
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,240
brilliant

498
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,200
but

499
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,880
at the end of the day from a security

500
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,480
perspective

501
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,679
it doesn't matter to the critical

502
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,080
infrastructure that goes offline

503
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,000
that you you

504
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,400
really a nice person and you know you

505
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,480
were intending to fix on something

506
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,919
sometime

507
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,760
um what what matters is that it was it

508
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,640
was left unfixed and it was exploited um

509
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,000
either by someone else or by you

510
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,720
so these are supplier risks and you

511
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,640
you're going to start to see some terms

512
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,160
and conditions

513
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,679
and transparency requirements that are

514
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,520
kind of toothy

515
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,440
that uh are a little scary for um some

516
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,520
of the the vendors

517
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,679
but that should be good news to open

518
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,760
source communities

519
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,919
because if anything they're going to

520
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,559
surface how integral to to the ecosystem

521
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,240
and how integral to our critical

522
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,440
infrastructure

523
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,280
open source capabilities really are

524
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
i like to include this document in all

525
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,679
the presentations that i can

526
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,159
it's called the simple sabotage manual

527
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,360
and it's sort of

528
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
a very old-school piece of evidence

529
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,880
about the point that i just made about

530
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,720
plausible deniability and maintenance

531
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
and sabotage

532
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
so this document was dropped behind

533
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,400
enemy lines

534
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,559
by the united states office of strategic

535
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,840
services

536
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,679
in world war ii

537
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,360
and it had to do with well if you want

538
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,280
to sabotage things

539
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,880
but you don't want to up and join the

540
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,640
resistance right what are some things

541
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,679
you can do

542
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,600
and a lot of it had to do with

543
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,640
maintenance leave tools dull

544
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,440
leave the caps off of things

545
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,919
um and these are the ways that you can

546
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,520
bring an enterprise to kind of a

547
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,000
creaking halt or make it

548
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,480
less responsive under attack

549
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,000
right because it's just things are so

550
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,320
badly maintained you can't get up and

551
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,679
respond

552
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,559
um on the right i i like to put the if

553
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,039
you want to sabotage uh an organization

554
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,240
and you happen to be a member of

555
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,159
management

556
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,159
um because these um

557
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,840
sabotage instructions are generally the

558
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,159
way we run things as a matter of regular

559
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,799
course in large bureaucracies

560
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,080
and bureaucratic nonprofit organizations

561
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
um anyway find us on the internet it's

562
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,280
it's good fun

563
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,240
bottom line

564
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,600
we see

565
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,320
a risk differentiation right and a drive

566
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,840
to quality

567
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,880
and 10 or 15 or 20 years ago when we

568
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,679
were all you know in the trenches

569
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,400
fighting the fight for open source

570
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,360
it was really there was this um

571
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,120
duality between

572
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,200
open source and proprietary like open

573
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,520
source versus proprietary

574
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,440
um now proprietary stuff had a lot of

575
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
open source in it anyway but they didn't

576
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,039
want anybody to know

577
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,440
we we we use this categorization

578
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,480
but it's not really valid anymore

579
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,320
partly because

580
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
uh open source has eaten the world

581
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,520
fortunately and a lot of the proprietary

582
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,440
capabilities and the vendor capabilities

583
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,880
that we use have a lot of open source in

584
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,600
it which we should know about

585
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,320
but also because open source isn't open

586
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,159
source you know this is we're not back

587
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,440
in the day where you know everything was

588
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,039
a gnu project with

589
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,159
tons of awesome community spirit behind

590
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,039
it

591
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,520
it there's

592
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,640
really really well supported

593
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,320
industrial enterprise grade open source

594
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,520
and then there's

595
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,400
folks

596
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,240
student projects

597
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,360
and um things that someone thought was

598
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,120
cool someday and

599
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,880
then left

600
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,799
and those are not the same things so i

601
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,520
say you know a gia certified diamond is

602
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,919
not the same as crazy jewels

603
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,840
and this is how we need to start

604
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,400
thinking about open source as you know

605
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,960
what what are the real gems that we have

606
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,880
that we need to take care of

607
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,280
what are our maybe

608
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,520
diamonds in the rough

609
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,760
and what are crazy duels

610
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,080
that you may want to play with you

611
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,439
definitely don't want to chew on

612
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,080
and again

613
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,280
maintenance right so

614
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,039
as a risk factor

615
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,559
you're going to see maintenance show up

616
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,679
in things like security slas

617
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,799
right so

618
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,200
we measure these we enforce these

619
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,520
if you have a system that you're

620
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,240
delivering to critical infrastructure

621
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,360
and

622
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,840
one day last happens

623
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,440
there's a critical vulnerability in some

624
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,840
component of it

625
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,720
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow

626
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,000
but soon and for the rest of critical

627
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
infrastructure you're gonna see

628
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,720
terms and conditions like well buddy

629
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,799
you got seven days to fix it

630
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,360
and ship me an update and if you don't

631
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,400
there's some remedies

632
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,159
because these kinds of contractual

633
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,919
conditions are generally what get

634
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,840
people's attention

635
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,039
and when you can automate the

636
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,720
measurement of this the screenshot of a

637
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,080
project that we're monitoring

638
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,320
then you can you can manage it what gets

639
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,440
measured gets managed so

640
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,799
we maintain maintenance records on

641
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,679
thousands of open source components

642
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,480
and when it comes to supply chain risk

643
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,760
management your supplier selection

644
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,200
part of it is

645
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,360
okay if there's two libraries that do

646
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,600
roughly the same things

647
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,360
which do you want to use

648
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,840
do you want to use the thing that has a

649
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,400
four day time to remediation

650
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
or do you want to use the thing that's

651
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,480
had critical vulnerabilities

652
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,559
for 14 months and no one cares

653
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,520
so

654
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
whatever your rule set happens to be

655
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
days in compliance days out of

656
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
compliance time to remediation

657
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,080
all of that can be wrapped and stacked

658
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,279
at scale and that's being done

659
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,120
and people who run critical

660
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,520
infrastructure and develop it so medical

661
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,440
device manufacturer

662
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,840
can now make an informed decision

663
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,320
about whether your senior year project

664
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,559
should be in their medical device

665
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,559
and if it's if you're the one who did

666
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,559
the senior year project

667
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,960
you would probably be appalled

668
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,440
that some medical device manufacturer

669
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,200
because they found it when they were in

670
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,799
college

671
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,559
might think to include

672
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,279
this library in their medical device

673
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,640
but there's no hard evidence right

674
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,159
there's a comfort factor we use what

675
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,919
we're used to

676
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,120
but now there's actual data that says

677
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,360
this is a non-maintained capability

678
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,679
here's the mean time to remediation for

679
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,360
the open source maintainer of this

680
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,559
component

681
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,720
and that can get better or worse right

682
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,320
that can be

683
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,480
people losing interest

684
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,559
or it can be more people

685
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,840
being interested

686
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,760
and your maintenance time and your

687
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,480
maintenance record improves

688
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,120
so

689
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,320
how does this affect open source

690
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,679
developers and ecosystems because i know

691
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,080
a lot of folks who work on open source

692
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,679
they look at these big bureaucracies

693
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,159
they look at governments they look at

694
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,919
federal contractors and they're like

695
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:40,799
well

696
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,120
all this transparency and risk and stuff

697
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,840
that's that looks like a you problem

698
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,919
not a me problem i'm just working on my

699
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,520
code

700
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,120
and

701
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,159
i can understand that

702
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,640
the issue is that

703
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,120
the security and risk calculus is going

704
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,919
to be done by someone

705
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,080
and

706
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,720
whoever does that there's a point of

707
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,559
control

708
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,080
and

709
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,000
my affinity with the open source

710
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,919
community as someone who's fought for

711
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,880
open source in these big regulated

712
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,559
critical infrastructures

713
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,559
is to have that point of control as

714
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,799
close to the edge as possible

715
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,960
so that the open source community and

716
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,520
open source maintainers themselves

717
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,480
can

718
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,440
own their verification can own their

719
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,760
security can um

720
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,159
differentiate themselves

721
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,320
as opposed to having rather opaque

722
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,159
um gators

723
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,120
um

724
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,480
occluding

725
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,080
that

726
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,520
function from them so

727
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,559
the

728
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,799
up shots are software builds and

729
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,600
materials for people who are developing

730
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
with modern engineering methods that's

731
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,520
that's kind of a hat trick right you can

732
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,360
spit it out of a build pipeline you can

733
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,919
put it into your repo there's formats

734
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,679
like spdx and cyclone dx and you know

735
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,279
all these formats that you can spit out

736
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,799
in s-bomb

737
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,919
and

738
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,840
do a lot of verification

739
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,600
there's a requirement for verification

740
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
right so not just what do i say about my

741
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,279
capabilities but what can be proven

742
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,039
about my capabilities

743
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,600
so i've been privileged to work with

744
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,279
steve springette

745
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,159
and others on the owasp software

746
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,320
component verification standard right

747
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,080
which really goes deep into the

748
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,240
provenance and pedigree of things

749
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,159
and what can be proven and what can be

750
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,000
automated

751
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,960
and

752
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,159
ideally

753
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,279
something that can be done on a

754
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,440
continuous basis

755
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,640
and for the open source community to

756
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,960
adopt these things and to really start

757
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
to step up

758
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
gives them a lot of initiative it gets

759
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,360
it's healthy for the community to to

760
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
shore itself up and to be able to prove

761
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,840
its own security

762
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,320
the last thing i would say is

763
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,480
that there needs to be a chain of trust

764
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,840
established

765
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,640
between source and binary because

766
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,880
we're seeing a lot of discrepancies

767
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,200
between what's in a source for repo

768
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,840
and what's in a package manager

769
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,120
and

770
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,960
there's not a strong chain of trust

771
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,600
between those two things

772
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,520
and ultimately

773
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,000
it it can affect

774
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,320
the acceptability of a package manager

775
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,720
as a distribution mechanism

776
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,440
so

777
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,480
our package managers are very important

778
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,520
they're widely used by a ton of people

779
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,720
but

780
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,440
critical infrastructure is

781
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,000
not super psyched

782
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,440
to use

783
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,919
source code that goes

784
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,720
through some process that's opaque and

785
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,679
becomes a package that's turns out to be

786
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:58,960
different

787
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,640
in significant ways

788
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,120
and sometimes in harmful ways

789
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,240
from the source code repository itself

790
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,679
so

791
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,840
the scenarios are

792
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,520
the establishment of a chain of trust

793
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,600
between the source code and the binary

794
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,919
by the package managers

795
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,279
or

796
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,120
some kind of alternate

797
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,200
chain of trust where

798
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,039
source is

799
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,640
the authority

800
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,520
and

801
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,320
there's some intermediary that does a

802
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,520
trusted build and makes it available

803
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,039
i don't really have a dog in the fight

804
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,159
here

805
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,559
but this needs to happen and it's going

806
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,840
to happen

807
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,120
and so

808
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,960
this is just something to be aware of on

809
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,679
the horizon and to

810
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,159
take steps to establish

811
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,520
if you care about the viability of the

812
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,480
package managers

813
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,720
supply chain risk management

814
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,600
we're looking at things like

815
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,440
concentration risk

816
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,399
so

817
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,799
for any given organization

818
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,279
um one of the beauties of software bills

819
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,399
and materials and the ability to look

820
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,640
n layers down into the supply chain as

821
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,000
you start to see the independent

822
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,640
interdependency of these things

823
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,720
and for components that are very highly

824
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,559
relied upon

825
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,159
that are transitive dependencies in

826
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,360
everything

827
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,960
which you might not have been able to

828
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,720
see before

829
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,559
those things are going to start to get

830
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,760
attention

831
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,279
and i think that's good

832
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,519
so they might be escrowed

833
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,240
someone might decide that wow this is in

834
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,960
41 of our stuff maybe we should dedicate

835
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,360
some time to upstream some fixes to that

836
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,760
open source project which would also be

837
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,960
good

838
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,720
the one favor

839
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,039
that people in security and critical

840
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,120
infrastructure i think would ask

841
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,039
of open source is

842
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,039
some kind of responsible end-of-life

843
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,399
policy for open source so commercial

844
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,880
vendor products say we're not supporting

845
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,039
acme version 1.4 as of this date

846
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,399
that doesn't necessarily

847
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,960
happen with open source

848
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,480
end of life is a real security issue

849
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,519
and

850
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,600
it would be wonderful

851
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,519
if open source

852
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,679
developers and maintainers

853
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,559
could

854
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,960
put a little bit of thought into you

855
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,919
know

856
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,919
when does something get archived

857
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,679
um and there's certain organizations

858
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,760
like you know even big bureaucratic

859
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,679
organizations like gsa have an auto

860
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,679
archiving for their github repositories

861
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,200
where if something goes

862
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,440
90 days without an update it gets auto

863
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,039
archived

864
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,640
and these

865
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,399
pieces of business

866
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,640
practice and business process and

867
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,919
automation and supplier behavior go a

868
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,840
long way

869
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,519
to de-risk

870
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,640
organizations that don't have mechanisms

871
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,880
to you know come through

872
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,640
and analyze whether something is end of

873
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,960
life or not

874
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,240
as i said before it's very important for

875
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,440
the open source community to drive this

876
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,399
and there's great efforts from owasp

877
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,480
and from a lot of the maintainers to do

878
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,080
this

879
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,480
it's very important to

880
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,720
achieve some transparency

881
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,279
not only in what's in something

882
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,640
but whether it's supported or not

883
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,840
and the process and the verifiability of

884
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,559
the

885
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,360
assurance that's produced

886
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,120
the chain of custody where did something

887
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,039
come from

888
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,279
and the reproducibility of results

889
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,600
because all of these things are

890
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,640
reasonable and fain requirements

891
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,720
for suppliers

892
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,399
in in any kind of critical

893
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,559
infrastructure system

894
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,640
and if

895
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,080
an ecosystem cannot support

896
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,360
reasonable and same requirements

897
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,360
related to supplier risk

898
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,880
then there's a whole bunch of

899
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,000
unreasonable and insane ones

900
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,200
that

901
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,960
i hear discussed

902
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,799
regularly

903
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,040
and that that's just

904
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,599
not a world we want to live in so as

905
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,918
they say in washington if you're not at

906
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,800
the table you're on the menu

907
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,399
and there are a lot of folks who have

908
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,719
just fought so hard

909
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,239
to

910
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,719
create space and oxygen

911
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,399
for open source in critical

912
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,159
infrastructure

913
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,280
that

914
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,040
we just don't want to see that all that

915
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,280
effort wasted

916
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,399
and things wrapped up and occluded and

917
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,560
appropriated

918
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,719
and put on the menu

919
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,078
when they should be at the table

920
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,199
i will leave you with this

921
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,760
most people who

922
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,440
maintain critical infrastructure

923
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,119
understand

924
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,520
that there are some pillars

925
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,920
and the people who maintain the pillars

926
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,680
are generally doing so thanklessly

927
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,920
and

928
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,200
it would be

929
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,400
terrible

930
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,440
to see

931
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,320
all that modern digital infrastructure

932
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
either get pulled down

933
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,640
or just slowed to a halt

934
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,880
because of

935
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,079
catastrophes in the supply chain

936
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,560
and that's what all this new

937
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,280
uh risk calculus is driving towards and

938
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,359
i think there are smart thing and

939
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,000
reasonable steps that we can all take

940
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,839
i know that i personally and ion channel

941
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,079
are going to help

942
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,240
the open source community

943
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,599
assure itself in whatever way we can

944
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,640
and

945
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,560
we know there's enough smarts

946
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,078
out there to get it done

947
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,400
there's some references

948
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
um you know anyone who wants to curl up

949
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,640
with 480 pages of this standards can do

950
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,680
so

951
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
and i'm sure this presentation will be

952
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,880
available to people later

953
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,880
just to understand you know what's

954
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,640
coming down the line

955
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
um and thank you

956
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,839
very much please find me
