here to help

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,520
hi i'm james bohm from leviathan

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,039
security group i run the healthcare

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,199
practice there and i'm here to talk

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,039
about secure application design with

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,320
high data privacy requirements

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,520
a little bit background about me i've

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,440
spent a lot of years consulting in

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,000
technology retail manufacturing and of

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,760
course healthcare and

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,079
most recently before my current position

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,640
i served a little over five years as the

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,480
cso for healthcare technology

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,879
organization where i either ran into

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,079
some of the challenges that we're going

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,000
to talk about today

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
solved them watched other people solve

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,879
them guided other people through them

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,640
and so i think this can be valuable to

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,960
folks in a number of spaces within

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,440
healthcare for ideas for how to build

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400
my current clients span the range of

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
this stuff so i'm i'm doing this out

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,479
there pretty much all the time

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,360
let's just dive in

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,880
so

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,720
this stuff's hard and lots of people get

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,840
it wrong

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
healthcare in particular has a lot of

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,600
work to do in this space but i think

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,360
it's important to spend a few minutes

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,159
talking about what we have to do and

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,680
what we should do

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,840
and some goals behind this that probably

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,680
going to look familiar to a lot of you

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,680
things like building security in and

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,759
privacy too now

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,000
attempting to keep things simple they

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,040
tend to

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,960
wind up and get very complicated very

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,920
quickly when we start building in some

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,600
difficult access patterns and things

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,960
like that

52
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,560
and then setting some patterns and

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,079
expectations you know the paved road

54
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,759
approach that many of you have seen with

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,920
uh give patterns to the builders the

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,000
builders will build the right way uh

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,240
these can help with all of the privacy

58
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,159
compliance regimens that we have to pay

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,119
attention to here

60
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,080
so why are we here i think we

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,319
we all live in a breach centric world i

62
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,319
just got a note another notice this week

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,239
about my data going somewhere it wasn't

64
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,480
supposed to

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,080
that leads to a regulatory response

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,920
which leads to regulatory enforcement

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
which maybe doesn't fix the situation

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
and we start the cycle

69
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,360
all over again

70
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,519
uh and we're not getting away from this

71
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,120
so we might as well try and at least

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
catch up and then

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
do some good design

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,040
goals here to hopefully get ahead and

75
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,480
maybe the next regulation comes along

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
and you take a look at it and say

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
we're ready for it that would be the

78
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,200
ultimate goal

79
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,360
so how did we get here there are a

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
number of regulations they're all

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
exceedingly complex and i've attempted

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,480
to distill them down into something very

83
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,720
very short here so the security rule in

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,920
hippo

85
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,879
talks mostly about protecting the data

86
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,239
and not just in code and and systems but

87
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,720
mostly in human actions so it's a lot

88
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,760
about

89
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,920
rules for the people handling the data

90
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,159
and to a lesser extent about technical

91
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,239
controls for protecting the data

92
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,360
uh the privacy rule talks about what the

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,440
data is allowed to be used for which

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
influences the controls around who's

95
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,560
allowed to see it and what they're

96
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
allowed to do with it and then what you

97
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
have to do if you disclose it which i

98
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,239
think we're probably all pretty familiar

99
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,879
with at some level and ultimately

100
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,560
who do you have to notify that you've

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,760
done something

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,920
wrong

103
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,200
gdpr

104
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,280
europeans have very specific rights

105
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,840
about their personal data and they have

106
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,000
started to find large numbers of euros

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,319
for violations of that

108
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,959
ccpa the california statute that came in

109
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,840
last year is very similar

110
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,599
pertains to californians note that

111
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,560
because it's a u.s state regulation

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,439
hipaa is explicitly

113
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,599
excluded from it so

114
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,280
we don't have a conflict here when we're

115
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,280
looking at ccpa plus hipaa uh hipaa

116
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,040
tender generally tends to overrule now

117
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,560
if we have privacy data that is not uh

118
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,639
health records and it's just personal

119
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,320
privacy data with no health information

120
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,040
attached then ccpa may come into play uh

121
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,280
even in a hipaa setting and then we've

122
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,840
got the u.s state regulations which

123
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,000
there are there are breach notifications

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,880
across all 50 states they tend to differ

125
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,440
a bit and there are three state privacy

126
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,479
laws ccpa being the key one of those but

127
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,160
others are starting to emerge now as

128
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,840
well

129
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,199
and i'm not joking when i say it's

130
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,360
complicated and call your lawyer

131
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,199
most of the response programs that i've

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,440
either been involved in or participated

133
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,840
in as a third party as they're as the

134
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,040
recipient of breach information

135
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,880
people don't tend to build into their

136
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,840
incident response and breach

137
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,919
notification plans what to do for each

138
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,759
state at that point

139
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,039
you really need to call someone

140
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,160
experienced with this stuff to

141
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
understand how the different regulations

142
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,000
and maybe the different counts of

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
affected people in each state that you

144
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,280
may have are going to play into it it

145
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,960
gets very complicated very quickly

146
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,440
so

147
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,520
we have to generally

148
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,919
be able to tell users who saw their data

149
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,520
and this does not include their own

150
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,039
accesses to that data we might want to

151
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,520
keep that for other reasons though

152
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,840
let them opt out this is the right to be

153
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,320
forgotten in gdpr that carries over now

154
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,840
to ccpa

155
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,919
we need to absolutely not keep their

156
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,240
data any longer than we needed and we'll

157
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,919
spend some more time talking about that

158
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,919
because that's complicated and

159
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,840
misunderstood

160
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
we absolutely need to protect the data

161
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,800
that we have and to be able to account

162
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,320
for where it went

163
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,800
and who saw it when

164
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,680
so what we don't have to do

165
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,360
is keep all the data if we don't need it

166
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,120
there's no specific requirement then

167
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,039
don't keep it first you have to ask is

168
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,560
there a regulatory requirement to keep

169
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,400
it and often there is is there a

170
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
business need to keep it and even more

171
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,199
often there is one of those

172
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,680
and ultimately is it your data so this

173
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,280
is where we need to unravel this just a

174
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,160
little bit so the regulatory requirement

175
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,800
speaking about hipaa since that's what a

176
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,680
lot of people tend to keep data for

177
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
specifically talks about certain types

178
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,600
of data that need to be kept for six

179
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,759
years now that data is mostly around

180
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,919
the actions of people handling the data

181
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,520
and who got to see it

182
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,919
it doesn't mean we need to keep

183
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,240
the data itself and as i said a minute

184
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
ago uh

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
it doesn't mean we even need to keep

186
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
access records for the person whose data

187
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,759
it is so if you run a portal where the

188
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,680
user who's phi

189
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,360
we're saving

190
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,919
looks at their data periodically

191
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,599
that's fine the access of someone to

192
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,680
their own data does not need to be

193
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,759
recorded for six years anybody else

194
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,440
looking at their data

195
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,840
does need to be recorded for six years

196
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,440
business needs are a whole other story

197
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,759
lots of folks tend to think we want this

198
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,240
data around just in case we ever needed

199
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,960
but hipaa actually talks about data you

200
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
shouldn't keep which is that you no

201
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,599
longer have a valid business purpose for

202
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,319
so if you don't have a need for

203
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,120
processing uh for producing reports for

204
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,440
any kind of historic information for

205
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,840
data you should probably get rid of it

206
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,039
so

207
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,039
bottom line review what you're being

208
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,039
asked to keep and for how long it's more

209
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,639
than we can talk about here but there

210
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,560
are some very specific categories of

211
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,479
information you do and don't need to

212
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,520
keep

213
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,080
and you should take a sharp eye to

214
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,479
data that you might be able to get rid

215
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,360
of

216
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,160
and

217
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,000
to start start conversations across the

218
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,240
business with do we really need this can

219
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
we really throw it away you can't breach

220
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,840
data that you don't have anymore

221
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,199
all right

222
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,039
what should we do this is where it gets

223
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,000
fun

224
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,759
so there's a famous food writer named

225
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,520
michael pollan many of you may have

226
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,800
heard of him uh he's written about

227
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
the food industry

228
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,039
over a number of years and eating trends

229
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,639
diet habits

230
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,800
all these kind of things

231
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,319
and he's put together a couple of simple

232
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,800
rules about what people should eat so

233
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,879
number one don't eat anything your

234
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,120
great-grandmother wouldn't recognize as

235
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,919
food so don't eat really processed stuff

236
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,840
that doesn't look like

237
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,679
the material that it originally came

238
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,958
from

239
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,640
whether that might be potato chips that

240
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,320
are perfectly symmetrical and came out

241
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,640
of a cylinder as opposed to look like a

242
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,279
slice of potato or yogurt that comes out

243
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,200
of a squeeze tube

244
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,839
things should look like food

245
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,720
number two eat food of course not too

246
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,000
much good idea mostly plants another

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
good idea we're learning

248
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,360
these seem pretty simple and

249
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,440
straightforward and in just a few words

250
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,519
there we've captured some really really

251
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,120
broad topics so i'm going to attempt to

252
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,279
do the same now so store personal data

253
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,240
carefully

254
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
not too much

255
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,760
only for as long as you need

256
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,519
access that personal data

257
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,279
only when necessary

258
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,720
to run your business

259
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,080
so let's look at how we can apply these

260
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
things

261
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,160
some design principles so we'll start

262
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,959
with identity data management

263
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,200
uh this is this is a big one

264
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,000
uh

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,519
the whole point of phi or pii is that

266
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,000
it's identifying to a person and once

267
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,320
we've identified a person

268
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
we have to protect that data differently

269
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
so one thing we can do right off the bat

270
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,519
is we can store that identity

271
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,399
information separately so if we have a

272
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,360
health record for example we can store

273
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,800
the identity of who owns that health

274
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,240
record separate from the health data

275
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,080
that talks about tests they've had or

276
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,040
conditions they've had things like that

277
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,640
it allows us to set up different access

278
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,240
permissions

279
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,160
in terms of when we join that data back

280
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,720
together the other thing we can do is we

281
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,360
can tokenize it or assign random

282
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,880
identifiers to it

283
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,200
the attribution of that identifier

284
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,440
doesn't readily identify the person we

285
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,720
took it back to you need more

286
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,120
information which we keep under lock and

287
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
key and only let very few people or very

288
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,480
few programs access to

289
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,200
get that information back

290
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
so limit how and when

291
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,480
these identifying actions take place and

292
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,959
log those actions and then this is a

293
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,560
critical section of code

294
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,240
uh involving a trust boundary that we

295
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,320
want to test and threat model

296
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
and really pay close attention to during

297
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,399
the sdlc

298
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,720
so some benefits we gain from doing this

299
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,600
right away are we can look at the data

300
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,720
most of it

301
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,640
and we're not instantly identifying the

302
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,079
person back

303
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,839
many of your users aren't going to need

304
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,399
that identifying information

305
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,560
uh those that do we can authorize an

306
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,440
audit and pay close attention to

307
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
enforcing this model can be verified and

308
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,480
tested

309
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,880
and

310
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,720
we can prohibit actions in code

311
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,399
pretty clearly

312
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,760
some of the complications for doing it

313
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,079
this way are the the the data

314
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,839
architecture and the code

315
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,640
uh

316
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,480
they get a little more complicated by

317
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
making this split and having to

318
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
carefully rejoin the information under

319
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,000
certain circumstances so that's one

320
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,360
thing we'll look at a little bit more

321
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,839
too

322
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,240
okay

323
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,120
identity records so we talked about

324
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,920
separating personal identifiers

325
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,440
we can destroy or de-identify

326
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,279
the identity information we'll talk more

327
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,320
about what that gains you as well

328
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,920
and then once we have the identity

329
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
separated we need to account for its

330
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,680
access and movement so when it is when

331
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
it is combined back up when it is sent

332
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,560
anywhere things like that

333
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,320
here's here's some interesting problems

334
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,160
that we run into when we take this

335
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,600
action now is if the identity is special

336
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,000
and separate

337
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
and we sometimes remove the identity

338
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,839
from the view or from the data itself

339
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,320
how do we keep record of access or

340
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
deletion if we don't have the original

341
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,040
identifier in its original form with us

342
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,480
there are some things we can do about

343
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
that but it's one thing to keep in mind

344
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,320
when you're designing another question

345
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,720
is should re-identification even be

346
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,000
possible

347
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
sometimes this is a one-way street and

348
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,519
once you've de-identified somebody

349
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,279
you're never coming back there may be

350
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,120
other business cases where there is a

351
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
infrequent need forensics might be one

352
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,440
of them to really establish you know

353
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,120
what what data was that where did it

354
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,160
come from

355
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,440
so you'll need to look at whether you

356
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,959
have justification or use cases

357
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,279
that require you to put that data ever

358
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,240
back together again

359
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,079
and this leads us to some interesting

360
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,079
considerations for live data access

361
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,200
should

362
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,760
wide swaths of your of your audience

363
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,040
your your users your operators coders

364
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,560
testers

365
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,800
have access to production data

366
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,079
why not

367
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,680
lots of organizations try and limit

368
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,000
production data access use to a bare

369
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,200
minimum

370
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
that's obviously to protect the data now

371
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,519
if we've separated the person

372
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,839
from the rest of their data and we're

373
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,600
trying to troubleshoot a problem if i

374
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,279
don't need to see who that data belongs

375
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,200
to i just need to see why it's causing a

376
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,279
side effect i can go look at that and

377
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,480
i'm not

378
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,440
really looking at pii or phi anymore i'm

379
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,199
just looking at essentially an

380
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,320
abstracted record uh of something that's

381
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,839
causing problems with my code or

382
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,600
reporting or

383
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,519
yeah the use case i have for it for some

384
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,600
other reason doesn't necessitate

385
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
identifying an individual so in that

386
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
case we can allow most of these internal

387
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,959
people

388
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,800
back into the data itself

389
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,000
so think about that for a minute you can

390
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,680
provide access just look at all your

391
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,040
business needs

392
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,440
to non-identity data

393
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,120
think about who looks at this data

394
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,560
whether the identity is really

395
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,800
absolutely necessary to them what kind

396
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,040
of reporting and analysis you can do

397
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,560
without having to look at individual

398
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,720
records

399
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,680
and then

400
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
it becomes easier to think about those

401
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,480
cases where

402
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
we do need to identify that data back so

403
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
a customer service

404
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,199
person for example fielding a call from

405
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,440
the the user whose pii or phi we're

406
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,959
talking about they clearly need it they

407
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,560
need to identify that person and talk to

408
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,240
them directly about it

409
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,160
medical staff perhaps there's there's a

410
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,519
few cases there

411
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,040
but it's certainly not all of your use

412
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,279
cases and if we can design around that

413
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,480
life will get a lot easier

414
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,880
so one way we can accomplish this

415
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,760
separation is cryptography of course

416
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,399
we're going to encrypt the records

417
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,880
interestingly enough hipaa doesn't say

418
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,440
that you have to encrypt all the records

419
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,160
but it does talk about having a really

420
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,480
really good reason for not encrypting

421
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,519
them so

422
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,000
we're going to encrypt them of course

423
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
but if there are strange uh use cases

424
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,959
you have that don't permit encryption

425
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,199
maybe temporarily uh under certain

426
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,920
circumstances you may be able to justify

427
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,720
that just think hard about it

428
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,800
in addition to encrypting the records we

429
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,240
have to protect the encryption keys

430
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,720
themselves and manage the cryptography

431
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,000
lifecycle along with our data lifecycle

432
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,399
things that often happen in complex

433
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,600
programs that handle this kind of

434
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,800
information

435
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,000
our keys either get hard-coded in or

436
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,600
other dependencies get set on them that

437
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,000
makes them difficult to change out in

438
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,160
addition algorithms key links are the

439
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,040
same way they don't live forever

440
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,720
we've certainly seen

441
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,279
the demise of some algorithms in the

442
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,959
past few years and we've seen some

443
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,880
recommendations that key lengths go up

444
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
in the past few years as well that's

445
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,399
going to continue so you should plan

446
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,680
around it

447
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,680
these things should be abstracted

448
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,800
configurable and easy to change

449
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,279
for transportation uh you want to keep

450
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,880
up with all of the changes going on in

451
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,639
tls uh

452
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,160
providing that's the method you're using

453
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,920
which most of us will use

454
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,839
storage gets a little more complicated

455
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,519
and we'll talk some more

456
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,199
about that

457
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,720
now

458
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,399
lots of people think that you can just

459
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,000
set whole disk or whole database

460
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,519
encryption in a managed database

461
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,279
instance or on a storage array or

462
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,040
something of that nature

463
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,000
and call it good technically you are

464
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,279
meeting

465
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,680
any kind of basic encryption mandate for

466
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,399
it

467
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,800
it's just not very practical

468
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
it may keep an auditor off your back and

469
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,399
get them to go away satisfied that the

470
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,560
data is encrypted but there are just too

471
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,720
many access use cases for that data

472
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
where it doesn't help

473
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,639
so let's apply a defense in-depth

474
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,639
approach to the earlier

475
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,959
we have about identity so we can now

476
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,279
encrypt the identity data either table

477
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,120
or column level

478
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,279
we can consider how we're going to key

479
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,119
that data now we could do it with person

480
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,559
level keys we could do it with table

481
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,559
level keys we could do it with customer

482
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,439
level keys just some organization of

483
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,280
keying detail that's going to make sense

484
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,480
for the way

485
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,520
you use your data over its life cycle

486
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
and then once we've abstracted all of

487
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,959
the access

488
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,199
code to encrypt and decrypt it hopefully

489
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,599
made that configurable so that we've got

490
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,679
a line of sight to the eventual sunset

491
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,440
of algorithms or key lengths or things

492
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,280
like that and the ability to change it

493
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,640
in code

494
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,679
we're in pretty good shape

495
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,919
so about rotation length algorithm

496
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:42,960
changes

497
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,039
we know that that these things are

498
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,280
trends that happen over time in fact

499
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,720
there are there are schedules and i'll

500
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,919
get to those in the references at the

501
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,840
end that you can look at to see when

502
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
your favorite encryption algorithm and

503
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,720
key length is good until uh according to

504
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,679
nist

505
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,679
and uh and when you should evaluate its

506
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,360
use again next

507
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,440
uh the other thing here is is that if

508
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,559
we're not storing the keys very

509
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,320
carefully and they get disclosed the

510
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,280
cleanup can be very very painful uh

511
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,120
wanting to perform a sudden keying

512
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,799
change on billions of records of data is

513
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,559
not only not practical it's going to

514
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,000
involve huge amounts of downtime and

515
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,640
a a huge

516
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,960
kind of reaction and disruption to

517
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,799
your business to be able to consider

518
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,480
even doing something like that if we

519
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,000
construct an architecture where that's

520
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,120
an extremely unlikely event uh and where

521
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,760
we've got some defenses to to mitigate

522
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,559
what happens if keys ever get disclosed

523
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,880
it could be very helpful in terms of the

524
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,320
the pain that you might face under that

525
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,480
worst case scenario

526
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,799
uh we want to abstract all the encrypt

527
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,640
decrypt and hash operations it just

528
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,440
makes it easier to change things out

529
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,960
same thing for configuration data we

530
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,400
want to make it as configurable as

531
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,320
possible don't put all that in code

532
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,080
don't don't make it necessary to do any

533
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,240
kind of an update to get that out there

534
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,679
and then we need to protect that

535
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,679
configuration data just like we protect

536
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,120
secrets

537
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,600
use a key manager use an hsm if you're

538
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,480
in aws you can use kms azure and google

539
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,160
compute have similar

540
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,400
key management platforms built into them

541
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,120
we can use hash corp vault in on-prem

542
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,640
code there are some other ways to do

543
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,200
that as well but we want to use

544
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,280
a trusted key manager that has been

545
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,600
fully vetted debugged and designed for

546
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,440
this purpose and then we want to use it

547
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,679
in the manner it was designed for to

548
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,120
basically

549
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,760
pass requests in get requests back and

550
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,000
avoid touching keys

551
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,840
as much as possible and just ask for

552
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,559
them to be retired rotated things like

553
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,480
that

554
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,520
the end goal for this is that no one

555
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,600
person or group in your organization

556
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,480
whether it be a database administrator a

557
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,520
coder an operations person

558
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,200
has access to the entire chain used here

559
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,520
to perform record encryption and

560
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
retrieval so a little more key managers

561
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,000
uh

562
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,640
when we're using a key manager these are

563
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,880
designed absolutely to protect keys but

564
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
they're not designed to protect millions

565
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
of keys so if we have millions

566
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,640
of uh of persons pii or phi in our

567
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,039
system it's not practical to assign them

568
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,559
an individual key and then expect the

569
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,080
key manager to manage millions of keys

570
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,440
so in this case we want to use something

571
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,200
called key derivation

572
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,360
these key managers are very good with a

573
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,679
small number of secrets and handling

574
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,000
rotation life cycles and key generation

575
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,360
and all the other aspects of key

576
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,440
management there we don't want to ask

577
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,000
them to do too much so maybe if we're

578
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
doing this at a table level or a

579
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
database level there's a finite number

580
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
of keys and it can store them just fine

581
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,520
if we want to store person level keys

582
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,799
then

583
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,000
we want to talk about something called

584
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,440
key derivation and this is where we

585
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,280
compose the key on the fly and don't

586
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,520
store it so where the the key is

587
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,720
basically algorithmically composed in

588
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,120
code uh from a combination of factors

589
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,480
part of it is going to be a secret that

590
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,280
we use that that key manager for

591
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,200
part of it is going to be something an

592
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,600
attribute about the person or the group

593
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,679
or customer or some other

594
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,480
division of data storage that you've got

595
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,120
and if we can have a unique identifier

596
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,760
for whatever that person or group level

597
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,799
is

598
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,960
combined with a secret that we've

599
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,840
retrieved from the key manager we can

600
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,240
put those together providing that we've

601
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,919
uh we've got enough entropy in each half

602
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,440
the key manager is almost guaranteed to

603
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,120
give that to you your person data

604
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,960
shouldn't be sequential or reverse

605
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,679
engineerable in any way maybe you want

606
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,520
to hash it first or

607
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,320
assign some kind of random identifier

608
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,480
every time you create a new record but

609
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,039
once we've got those reasonably random

610
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,120
and combined and have a sufficient

611
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
length to compose a key

612
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,799
we put that in either directly as our

613
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,799
key itself or we put it through

614
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,080
an algorithm like like a one-way hash to

615
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,480
derive a key that is now used for that

616
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,080
record you have to be able to repeat

617
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,360
this action

618
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,520
the point of not storing the key is that

619
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,840
we can generate it on the fly without

620
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,080
too many operations from other data we

621
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,000
have readily on hand

622
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,159
and then we have the key back

623
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,679
this works

624
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,960
really well

625
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,280
if you want to go to the complexity of

626
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
having person level records

627
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,679
even up to millions of persons in your

628
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,679
system you just have to have the right

629
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,600
inputs to it

630
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,280
obviously it makes things like key

631
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,880
rotation and algorithm changes just a

632
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,159
little bit more complicated because

633
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,720
we've got so many keys out there

634
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,120
the the operation to say re-encrypt a

635
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,960
database with millions and millions of

636
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,600
different keys inside of it

637
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,480
is a whole lot more compute time

638
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,880
to do and that's that's definitely a use

639
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,600
case consideration for when you decide

640
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,440
uh to retire

641
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,320
a particular key or key uh composition

642
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,840
and rebuild it

643
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
we'll talk about that more in a minute

644
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,400
too

645
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,559
uh so again avoid predictable patterns

646
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,720
when you're creating your keys they they

647
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,120
need to be highly random not reverse

648
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,000
engineerable at all

649
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
logging in accountability so

650
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,039
don't log the pi itself that should

651
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,039
pretty much be a given uh having

652
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,799
personal identifiers in our logs just

653
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,720
subjects our logs to a lot of things we

654
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,960
don't want them subject to

655
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,559
like the kind of encryption we were just

656
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,600
talking about if we have

657
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,760
derived some kind of token or internal

658
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
identifier

659
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,960
for our people we can use that to link

660
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,200
back to the pii

661
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,600
we need to log accesses to the pii so if

662
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
a record got retrieved for some reason

663
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,679
we ultimately need to be able to account

664
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,520
for the fact that that record was

665
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,279
retrieved by

666
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,559
whoever retrieved it at a date and time

667
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,480
this is going to drive

668
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,240
potentially investigation and forensics

669
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,000
needs if you ever get into a breach

670
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,600
scenario uh it satisfies the need for

671
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
multiple regulations to account for

672
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,520
users about who saw their data at

673
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,400
various points in time

674
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,600
but it does make things a little bit

675
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,080
more complicated uh for logging and we

676
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,279
don't want to make logging too hard for

677
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,559
the people who have to go into logs and

678
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,880
troubleshoot things so one of the

679
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,679
methods you can use here is if we have

680
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,640
a token or internal identifier that

681
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,039
uniquely identify as a person

682
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,640
there's a really easy hand-off we can do

683
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,440
so imagine a scenario where

684
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,200
you're notified

685
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,600
by the customer that their record is

686
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
incorrect and the customer service rep

687
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,840
looks at it and says yep your record's

688
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,200
incorrect i'm going to have to get one

689
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,919
of our programmers to look at this

690
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,400
they file a ticket programmer goes in

691
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,080
programmer does not have access to the

692
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,640
pii so in this case the customer service

693
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
person instructs

694
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,279
hey

695
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,960
this record number with this unique

696
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,559
identifier

697
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,400
is wrong and here's what's wrong with it

698
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,840
or here's what the customer is reporting

699
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,520
what's wrong with it so the identifier

700
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,600
gets passed to the person doing the

701
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,120
debugging they don't have access to the

702
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,720
identity at all but they don't need it

703
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,880
it's been the the clue to the identity

704
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,159
that they need

705
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,240
has been given to them and they can go

706
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,120
on and conduct their investigation i

707
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
you think about this when doing tooling

708
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,640
for example uh

709
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
you might make some uh debug and

710
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,360
forensic tools that rely on some kind of

711
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,279
a handoff of identifiers maybe it's an

712
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,679
input maybe it's it's brought in a list

713
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,600
or table a spreadsheet something like

714
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,120
that and you can just put that in and

715
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,440
start doing lookups on the data in

716
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,600
question

717
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,200
the more investigative tools you have at

718
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
your disposal the easier it's going to

719
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,000
be to conclude an investigation which

720
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,600
hopefully leads to lower record counts

721
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,679
record counts being an important thing

722
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,679
here

723
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,559
so hipaa in particular has a standard

724
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,279
for de-identification itself

725
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,120
if you de-identify the data

726
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,200
it's no longer subject to hipaa there's

727
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,360
two ways to do this one is to remove all

728
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,159
18 of the identifiers that hipaa defines

729
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,360
that make a record phi

730
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,200
the second is to have an expert review

731
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,039
of your de-identification process and

732
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,679
this is much more involved

733
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,520
takes a fair amount of time and can get

734
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,640
expensive

735
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,159
in this case you basically have an

736
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,679
expert statistician with deep hipaa

737
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,120
knowledge look at your process and

738
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,720
determine whether it's good enough to

739
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,559
avoid re-identification of that data

740
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,039
so if we've already taken the step of

741
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,039
logically separating identity data

742
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,960
tokenizing it some combination of those

743
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,360
things this gets a lot easier

744
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,679
we just break that link to the identity

745
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,760
we can do that by removing encryption

746
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,400
keys we can do it by making a copy of

747
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,679
the data

748
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,880
and severing

749
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,360
access to the identity data itself there

750
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,799
are a number of methods to do this and

751
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,799
what we arrive at now is a data set that

752
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,480
can be used for just about any other

753
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,640
purpose other than going back and

754
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,960
looking up an individual person

755
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,279
this is one way you can meet the right

756
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,799
to be forgotten

757
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,240
if you've broken

758
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,200
in a one-way direction that linkage to

759
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,640
the person

760
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,000
then

761
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,399
we've effectively been forgotten uh you

762
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,320
still have the data you just can't ever

763
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
attribute it back to that person again

764
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,600
so the person is forgotten

765
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,399
and finally on the data topic retention

766
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,799
too often retention and purge plans are

767
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,120
left to be a future exercise uh people

768
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,279
look at that six-year retention statute

769
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,760
for hipaa don't think real hard about

770
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,679
exactly which things in particular it

771
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,600
applies to and just assume all of that

772
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,679
data is subject to 60 years and that's a

773
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,600
long time from now so i'm not going to

774
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,799
code to that i'm not going to think

775
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,159
about it i'm not going to plan for it

776
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,039
but it'll creep up on you pretty quickly

777
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,480
not only that a lot of that data isn't

778
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,760
subject to that retention limit in the

779
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,600
first place anyway

780
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,760
so when the data has to go away it's

781
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,440
it's time to have a plan for it now this

782
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,840
could be simple it could be a simple uh

783
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,200
you know statement that's written in a

784
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,880
policy somewhere that says we're going

785
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,240
to deal with this when the time comes

786
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,360
and here are the actions we're going to

787
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,480
take

788
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,919
it could be as simple as having a dba

789
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,399
write a sprock that gets stored off in a

790
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,960
dark corner and when the time comes okay

791
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,120
we're going to manually run that sprock

792
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,720
and we're just going to wipe the data

793
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
out it could be doing the

794
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,320
de-identification step we just talked

795
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,440
about

796
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,880
it could be deleting the data there's

797
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,399
any number of things you can do at this

798
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,480
point but the key being stop holding

799
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,720
data you don't need anymore

800
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,799
the identified data itself may often

801
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,120
have a different retention schedule

802
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,799
people like to keep historic trending

803
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,840
information uh if you're in a retail

804
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,360
space

805
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,360
marketing loves to keep pii and spending

806
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,840
habits and purchase habits on people if

807
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,360
you can find a way to de-identify that

808
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,799
from the people and just say you know

809
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,960
our population in this region likes to

810
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,640
buy these things

811
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
and their trend over the last 10 years

812
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,480
was to buy them like this

813
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,919
maybe you can keep marketing happy

814
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,520
without having to go back and keep

815
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,679
records of exactly who bought that stuff

816
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,520
years ago so think about things like

817
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,760
that

818
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,200
first and foremost run a good

819
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,880
vulnerability management program

820
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:23,919
this

821
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,880
is complicated stuff code wise um you're

822
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,279
going to need to ensure that

823
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,440
you've built it well it's subject to

824
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,000
threats we don't know about yet maybe

825
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,360
you're going to threat model a lot of

826
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,720
the code you're going to run the usual

827
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,559
kind of tools on your code whether it's

828
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,399
dynamic or static analysis you're going

829
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,840
to subject it to all sorts of testing

830
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,520
you're going to keep up with the third

831
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,919
party libraries that you undoubtedly are

832
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,279
using and

833
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,720
the vulnerabilities that get announced

834
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,279
in them so do all of those basic things

835
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,120
and be able to demonstrate that that you

836
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
do them we'll talk more about why you

837
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,559
need to be able to demonstrate this in a

838
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,799
few minutes

839
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,080
include multi-factor authentication

840
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,279
way too many

841
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,440
applications in this space still do not

842
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,000
fully support mfa

843
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,080
now which factors you use and whether

844
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,679
they're mandatory in certain cases

845
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,039
there's there's a lot of use case

846
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,799
considerations for that you have to

847
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,480
think about whether if your audience

848
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,000
doesn't all have smartphones and using a

849
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
smartphone based token isn't really a

850
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,279
great idea

851
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,120
sms is not the best mfa but it's

852
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
much more ubiquitous more likely to work

853
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
for more of your audience you may have

854
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,039
some cases where you can't depend on

855
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,159
telephony via sms or a smartphone at all

856
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,039
and you need some other method entirely

857
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,559
you may have a number of internal use

858
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,080
cases where the user's been already

859
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
authenticated through an sso already

860
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,720
subject to mfa somewhere else like a vpn

861
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,520
maybe

862
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,760
or some other entry point and you don't

863
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,880
need to

864
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,520
redo that you may be on a mobile device

865
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,159
where you can take advantage of

866
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,159
the biometrics offered by the device

867
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,440
itself

868
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,120
if you can get that to work with the

869
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,279
rest of your code

870
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,880
but then you're gonna have cases where

871
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,960
not every phone is gonna have them

872
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,679
so this this uh requires a lot of

873
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,679
thought uh but

874
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,799
the general rule here is do what you can

875
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,880
be ready for the future where

876
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,840
you're going to have more token choices

877
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,480
on more devices in front of you

878
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,080
be ready for the point where you can

879
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,559
make this mandatory by

880
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,880
introducing it as advisory first or

881
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,519
mandatory for certain audiences first

882
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,159
and just be ready to have a day when mfa

883
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:34,880
is

884
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,559
the rule rather than

885
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,519
the exception or a special case

886
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,360
separate your production data from your

887
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
lower environments now

888
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,360
this also is kind of a basic

889
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,799
in the world of

890
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,440
live data about people

891
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,039
we want to make sure that we don't allow

892
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,399
production data into the lower

893
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,480
environments that means that if you do

894
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,919
need to make test data out of live data

895
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,159
you've done something

896
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,240
to de-identify or abstract it before

897
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,000
moving it down or you've you've

898
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
scrambled the data somehow so that

899
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,960
resembles nothing like its original form

900
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,120
again our de-identification steps can be

901
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,480
very uh

902
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,720
very useful there we can we can

903
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
de-identify the data and then we can

904
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,679
reassociate it with random fictitious

905
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,360
individuals instead of the real ones

906
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,840
down in the lower environment

907
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,679
we make it hard to mistakenly move the

908
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,159
production data down so a copy down

909
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,279
shouldn't function in a lower

910
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,799
environment and if we're using different

911
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,480
encryption at the environment level at

912
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,159
the table level maybe even at the person

913
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,440
level

914
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,840
these give us a leg up in doing this so

915
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,000
now if the code does or sorry if the

916
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,960
data does find itself in a staging or a

917
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,279
test environment all of a sudden and we

918
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,039
attempt to look it up the keys aren't

919
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,159
going to match and the data won't

920
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,360
decrypt and you'll find out pretty

921
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,639
quickly the data is wrong

922
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,480
so most applications that run in this

923
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,600
space

924
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,480
are going to be subject either to

925
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,159
an internal or external audit or

926
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,760
assessment

927
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,200
and often supply chain assessments where

928
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,039
your customers are demanding certain

929
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,000
things

930
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
of you and they want to know a lot about

931
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,679
this application and the protective

932
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,200
measures it takes

933
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,399
so showing them you've got a good

934
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,320
vulnerability management program maybe

935
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,559
you've got internal and external pen

936
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,559
test data things like that those those

937
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,559
are pretty standard in these in the

938
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,720
supply chain management exercises when

939
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,519
you go through an assessment or audit

940
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,840
also you tend to wind up answering a lot

941
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,600
of questionnaires

942
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,799
and the questionnaires can be

943
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,399
quite detailed about what they want to

944
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,039
know they may ask questions about

945
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,080
the way

946
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,000
you're encrypting records and storing

947
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,919
keys and some of the techniques we've

948
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,200
gone over here are not so common that

949
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,240
someone's going to immediately

950
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,080
understand your answers if you were to

951
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,760
take some of these

952
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,039
suggestions

953
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:57,430
and

954
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,559
[Music]

955
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,960
they may in fact even lead to answering

956
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,200
no's and columns that your assessor is

957
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,360
expecting to see a yes in so for that it

958
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,840
helps to have a write-up so document uh

959
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,280
the protective measures the data design

960
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,679
steps you you've performed in a couple

961
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,520
of pages in a short paper

962
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,480
uh

963
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,159
be able to provide this along with your

964
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,599
assessment answers for need to know

965
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,280
audiences i've gone as far as creating

966
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,639
decks for auditors where it lead them

967
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,639
through this is the architecture

968
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,560
that you're about to go review

969
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,679
these are some things that may be

970
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,760
unusual about this or the approaches

971
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,839
we've taken that maybe aren't so common

972
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,199
and don't make sense to you and here's

973
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,719
why we did them and here's how they

974
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,639
protect the data here's why you should

975
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,079
be comfortable with it

976
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,320
be ready to be uh to be able to explain

977
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,800
those kind of things to your audiences

978
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,480
so that you don't get scrutinized for

979
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,560
not doing say encryption exactly the way

980
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,320
they expected it to and maybe doing it

981
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,560
actually far better but just in a way

982
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,159
that doesn't immediately make sense to

983
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,320
them

984
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,239
risk management if you're subject to

985
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,918
hipaa you need to perform periodic risk

986
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,760
assessments your vulnerability

987
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,839
management program is a major part of

988
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,599
that threat models definitely a part of

989
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,400
that

990
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,160
your remediation plans your actions and

991
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
your priorities should absolutely be

992
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,000
documented you may need to provide proof

993
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,599
of them at some point it says here's you

994
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,200
know here's here are the risks we saw

995
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,720
here's how we assess them here's how we

996
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,839
decided to treat them and prioritize

997
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:19,040
them those decisions need to be

998
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
involved with business stakeholders this

999
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,560
is not just

1000
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,960
security or technology saying we're not

1001
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,240
going to fix that bug or we are going to

1002
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,680
fix that bug there are business

1003
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,359
considerations to all this so you want

1004
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,720
to be able to show that everybody was

1005
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,040
involved in evaluating the risks that

1006
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,960
you found and deciding how you're going

1007
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,480
to take care of them

1008
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,720
periodic external testing

1009
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,560
should definitely be a component it is

1010
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
not necessarily required by regulation

1011
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,880
we all know it's a good idea to involve

1012
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,480
an outside tester from time to time to

1013
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,839
find things we just aren't thinking

1014
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,160
about

1015
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,680
finally future proofing

1016
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,839
so we do need to periodically review the

1017
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,520
decisions we've made here particularly

1018
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,839
around cryptography and data retention

1019
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,599
we're making assumptions based on

1020
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,599
current day standards they're

1021
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,760
potentially subject to change we want to

1022
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,839
look at this periodically i would advise

1023
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,520
no less than annually

1024
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,920
to determine are our algorithms now

1025
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,440
slated for sunset and we need to start

1026
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,720
thinking about replacing them that

1027
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,960
sunset period maybe one two three years

1028
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,280
out that gives us time to prepare uh is

1029
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,880
the retention schedule for certain types

1030
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,800
of records changing

1031
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,640
have we hit one of those time defined

1032
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,560
limits like six years where we should be

1033
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,960
taking action now

1034
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,400
you want to review logs and access

1035
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
rights periodically this gets

1036
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,960
relatively painful it is mandated under

1037
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,119
hipaa although just not exactly how you

1038
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,320
do it so how could be a fair amount of

1039
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,680
automation

1040
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,119
involved in

1041
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,000
bringing anomalous behavior

1042
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,119
to eyeballs to review but having the the

1043
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,760
log process be relatively automated

1044
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,280
you want to delegate some of your review

1045
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,280
activities particularly around

1046
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,119
hipaa access rights

1047
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,040
out of security and audit to keep them

1048
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,800
focused on their day-to-day jobs

1049
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,320
delegate to

1050
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,800
to managers and organizations who have

1051
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,720
the people who access these records to

1052
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,560
review their access rights and whether

1053
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,000
they're still current for everybody's

1054
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,359
job description and needs

1055
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,920
and then finally we have some resources

1056
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,040
here so

1057
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,800
rather than pointing folks back to the

1058
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,560
hipaa security and privacy rules

1059
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,720
themselves they they are difficult to

1060
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,880
read uh they're they're written in the

1061
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,720
federal register format which has a lot

1062
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,960
of commentary and then a very specific

1063
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,640
set of language which is often difficult

1064
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,480
to dig out from the middle of that

1065
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,640
i would point you instead to the office

1066
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
of civil rights

1067
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,760
hipaa audit protocol

1068
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,040
this is essentially a series of

1069
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,560
assessment questions that can be

1070
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,520
answered

1071
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,160
uh on a scale and then you you look at

1072
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
your answers it's essentially an

1073
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,320
auditor's cheat sheet if you look at

1074
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,400
that and you're in line with being able

1075
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,240
to answer all of the questions in there

1076
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,320
regarding treatment and data handling

1077
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,240
you're probably doing a good job but do

1078
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,400
look at the entire list there

1079
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,079
gdpr and ccpa i point here to the

1080
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,839
statutes themselves you'll find lots and

1081
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,920
lots of third-party commentary on them

1082
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,760
but these are where you go to find the

1083
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,680
rule as it's written today and then

1084
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,920
finally a lot of resources from this

1085
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,160
that are particularly helpful here

1086
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,760
sp 800-66 is an overall guide to hipaa

1087
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,520
and it's not exactly a list of things

1088
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,720
you need to do here but it is a

1089
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,560
reference to all of the other standards

1090
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,200
that come into play uh 800-30 on risk

1091
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,040
management for example and then a whole

1092
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,960
bunch of ones on cryptography down below

1093
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,520
and 800-53 for your general security

1094
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,680
controls and it talks in kind of a hipaa

1095
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,079
focused lens about how to apply those

1096
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,680
other documents what parts of them are

1097
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,400
important to consider for hipaa uh which

1098
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,040
which information is is key here

1099
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,400
as opposed to

1100
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,320
let's just apply a whole lot of things

1101
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,000
to it and we'll more than cover the base

1102
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,160
let's we'll look here to determine what

1103
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
do we need to really focus on

1104
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,680
specifically for hipaa and then the 800

1105
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,920
series on cryptography there's a number

1106
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,480
of standards here that talk about how to

1107
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,160
uh how to use

1108
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,880
different algorithms how to use keys how

1109
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,480
to manage keys

1110
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,760
when to when to look at rotation periods

1111
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,280
and sunset times for different

1112
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,599
algorithms and key types so look to

1113
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,359
those 131a is my most useful reference

1114
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,800
here once we've got a completely

1115
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,240
implemented system

1116
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,680
it's kept up to date every couple of

1117
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,920
years with the expected lifespan of all

1118
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,599
of the common algorithms so we can look

1119
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,160
there and see that you know aes 128 and

1120
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,920
256 are considered good for the

1121
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
foreseeable future there are some other

1122
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,599
things in there that are not

1123
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,839
uh if you tracked the long slow decline

1124
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,400
of sha-1 over the last several years you

1125
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,079
will find in the in revisions one and

1126
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,760
two of 800-131 a their predictions about

1127
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,280
when you should get rid of that for

1128
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,240
example so it's a good reference for are

1129
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,598
we keeping up with the times

1130
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,000
and that concludes my talk uh hopefully

1131
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,920
we've been uh taking questions on the

1132
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,480
side here via the chat window and uh i

1133
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,079
will put up my information here for

1134
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,839
follow-up questions

1135
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,760
uh as well

1136
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,119
so look forward to hearing from you if

1137
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,640
you do have questions happy to answer

1138
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,960
them now if they're short send me email

1139
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,800
if they're not thank you very much for

1140
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,280
attending my talk
