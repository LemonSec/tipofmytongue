public pentos reports here this is other

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,880
stuff i've learned in other companies

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,279
and other courses i've written for

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,960
practical web defense about hacking and

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,720
defending uh

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,800
web applications i'm also the os

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,240
volleyball tf project leader one of them

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,400
there's some presentations here and i

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,279
also delivered i also have like a number

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,920
of security certifications and stuff

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,719
um

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,640
that i can talk about

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,320
over some years about how that happens

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,239
if you are interested

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,399
so in this talk we are going to cover

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,719
part of the last three pentas reports

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,120
here about

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,879
chinese police apps

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,640
uh more about surveillance and stuff as

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
well later and the first two are more

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,120
about mobile security about what you

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,520
should never do when you write a mobile

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,480
application

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,800
you can see that pretty much here this

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,640
almost every mistake possible was done

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,199
so very good for

32
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,119
learning about that and there's other

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,560
reports there as well if you're

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,240
interested

35
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,760
so today

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,479
we're going to talk about uh cloud pets

37
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,280
uh and then a couple of chinese police

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,520
apps right so

39
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,479
let's take a look at this so clouds uh

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,880
the best way to explain this is for you

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,560
to

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,799
watch

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,360
so

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,640
in here you will basically see uh

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,400
you know what the vendor says about this

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,000
and it's it just makes it easier to

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,360
understand how the whole process works

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,720
this is another demo

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,799
so essentially what happens is

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,880
the parent is far from home

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,439
and they send messages to the child

52
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,680
using a mobile app right so the idea is

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,159
that the parent somehow feels close to

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,560
the child and the other way around

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200
the child receives this message

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,799
these messages that the parent sends

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,960
through the soft toy and then the child

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,878
can send the messages

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,800
uh some can send messages back to the

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,120
parents using the soft toy

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
and the parent receives the messages on

62
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,319
the mobile app right so

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,280
that is the basic idea and the way it

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,560
works is that the toy uses bluetooth low

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,319
energy to communicate with the mobile

66
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,360
app

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,720
so the the toy has bluetooth it has a

68
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,400
microphone and it has a speaker right

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,879
because it needs to play the message

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,959
from the parent

71
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,120
then the mobile app on the front phone

72
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,800
is away from the toy

73
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
it sends and receives messages to from a

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,879
cloud pad servers at the beginning and

75
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,920
then amazon is three later

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,879
and then

77
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,120
the mobile app on the child device is

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,879
close to the toy so it sends and

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,280
receives messages to um

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,959
from the servers

81
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,879
and uploads and downloads messages to

82
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,640
and from the toy using bluetooth low

83
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,879
energy so that is the main way

84
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,840
which

85
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,800
this was working so uh just pause this

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
for a minute and try to think what could

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,239
go wrong with this

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,680
um yeah so

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,599
basically uh

90
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,440
the first thing that happened was that

91
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,760
the mongol database where all the data

92
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,560
was

93
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
was exposed without authentication on

94
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,000
the internet

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
so

96
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
an authorized parties downloaded the

97
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,319
database they got three ransom requests

98
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,120
it was indexed by showdown um

99
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,680
pretty much one million users at risk

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,239
and the company that developed this

101
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,239
claim to never have found evidence of

102
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,959
any bridge despite all these

103
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
documented stuff

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,799
this is a screenshot from the public

105
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,680
database um and yeah and then there were

106
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
like password hashes emails links to all

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,239
voice recordings from child children and

108
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,239
parents and all these so you can see i

109
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,519
write up on this on trihant's blog

110
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,720
um so this is the first ransom

111
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,879
right and there was uh they basically

112
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,640
got a message like this it was on

113
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,480
facebook on twitter

114
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,439
uh

115
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,519
so the initial timeline is like multiple

116
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,080
security researchers alert the cloud

117
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,480
pets uh through multiple means right

118
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,798
during these dates

119
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,798
and then after so the company did

120
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,600
nothing right and then after this they

121
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
got the first ransom so the original

122
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,639
databases were deleted and uh ransom

123
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,880
demand left on the system

124
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,360
using a please read message

125
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,240
then two more ransoms afterwards

126
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,960
for the same thing and then on the 13th

127
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,479
of january

128
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,720
no databases were found to be publicly

129
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
accessible anymore

130
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,639
so let's talk about uh that's about the

131
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,960
server security or lack of it and now

132
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,040
let's talk about the toy security right

133
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,840
so

134
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,360
um

135
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,080
the charge here was led by paul stone so

136
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,120
you can read his research on this blog

137
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,520
post and basically he concluded that the

138
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,880
toy has no

139
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,199
built-in bluetooth security features no

140
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,680
authentication for bonding or pairing

141
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
between the device and the phone

142
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,840
anyone can connect to the toy as long as

143
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,080
it is switched on so this is very scary

144
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,199
because

145
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,720
if somebody's on the street they can

146
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
tell the child for example to open the

147
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,600
door or stuff like that so it's it's

148
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,039
quite bad

149
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,680
and then for upgrades the firmware is

150
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,120
unencrypted and upgrades only use a

151
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,600
weak checksum for validation

152
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,520
which is not

153
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,039
this is not safe

154
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,600
and is possible to remotely modify the

155
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,639
toei's firmware as well right so

156
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,280
overall pretty bad

157
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,000
and yeah you can watch a demo here

158
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,680
explaining all these weaknesses

159
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,400
so

160
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,240
after all these

161
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,360
of course pollstone also contacted the

162
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,400
[Music]

163
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,600
spiral toys the company behind this um

164
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
so there were multiple write-ups about

165
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
the lack of security of the toy the lack

166
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,919
of use of built-in security features

167
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,800
all attempts to warn spiral tools failed

168
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
and then the company

169
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
confirms that they did not reply to the

170
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
databricks emails and rather decided to

171
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,960
fix them right so that is what

172
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,800
they said so the question is what did

173
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
they fix

174
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,520
uh mozilla who sponsored the audio that

175
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
i'm going to talk about now

176
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,039
was basically asking

177
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,800
are the toys safe now right because they

178
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,919
are saying

179
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
um they fixed everything so

180
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,080
let's check right so this is where our

181
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,160
actual work begins

182
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,960
since i was on this one with jesper i

183
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,600
decided to add some kind of viking motif

184
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
so this is the proper historical viking

185
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,240
helmet and this is the fun one

186
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,120
but yeah we just in honor of him i

187
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,400
decided to do this little tribute to um

188
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,319
how i like biking stuff

189
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,319
so yeah he looked more at the firmware

190
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,880
stuff of the unicorn toy so he was

191
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,000
looking more

192
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
at the firmware and tried to

193
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,080
find problems on that and yeah this is

194
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
my my life actually

195
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,039
um

196
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,880
so yeah what could possibly

197
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,479
go wrong right so the first thing we

198
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,639
found was that the cloud pets app

199
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,319
directs users to

200
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,880
clear text http domain

201
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,720
the domain is currently on sale so

202
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,560
anybody can purchase the domain and

203
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,360
influence users right so this is but i

204
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
mean it's bad already that it uses clear

205
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,080
types http but it's even worse but the

206
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
domain is for sale because anybody can

207
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,080
buy it and just get uh you know

208
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,400
for example from users for credentials

209
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,919
on this page

210
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,759
and can take over accounts and stuff

211
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,639
right

212
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,240
so it prompts

213
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,759
for example you could prompt users for

214
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,759
credentials or you could prompt users to

215
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,599
download malicious apps right so just a

216
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,080
couple of examples

217
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,400
date is requested over cleartext http so

218
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,720
anybody on a public wi-fi could

219
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,960
potentially change that

220
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,280
and replace it with anything else

221
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,400
so

222
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,160
uh this is bad right

223
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,080
and yeah i'm basically the same thread

224
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,240
like you could ask for credentials from

225
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,639
the users to download malicious apps and

226
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,160
all that stuff

227
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,080
um so this is how it looks like in

228
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,199
practice

229
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,879
uh we have uh the app here and then you

230
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,080
uh

231
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,720
click here for help and then you get uh

232
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,400
that this domain is for sale so this is

233
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,639
basically what you will see

234
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,560
on the phone

235
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,520
uh and then other issues are that the

236
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,280
polestones public proof of concept

237
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,679
remains working without any changes so

238
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,519
basically you can navigate with your

239
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,719
phone here

240
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,599
and just play with the toy without any

241
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,080
modification to the proof of concept

242
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,480
uh proving that absolutely nothing has

243
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
been fixed right so you can push all you

244
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
can for example a stranger can connect

245
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,000
to the toy without authentications of

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,080
somebody walking on the street

247
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,839
you can push audio and play it on the

248
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,320
toy so you can for example

249
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,279
uh make the toy say open the door uh i'm

250
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,519
your friend whatever to a child and then

251
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,839
if the child opens the door uh the thief

252
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,920
is in for example right

253
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,680
and you can download audio from the toy

254
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,519
so you can use the toy as a spy device

255
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,920
to see what's going on whatever the toy

256
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,200
is so it's pretty scary stuff right

257
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
and other issues uh no firmware

258
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,000
protections in place so basically the

259
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,480
same problem with firmware verification

260
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,880
remains

261
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,120
the firmware is installed using

262
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,720
bluetooth lower energy but the

263
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
installation process still has no

264
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,040
verification there's no single signature

265
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
or integrity checks in place so the only

266
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,279
protection is just a checksum

267
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,320
so it's uh not safe

268
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,720
and then another problem is that the

269
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,279
cloudpads voice recordings are worlds

270
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,360
readable right so it's all saved on an

271
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,839
s3 bucket

272
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,440
but there's no authentication or

273
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,519
anything so if you know the url you can

274
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,320
dump it and the packet is also not

275
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
very well configured so it's all pretty

276
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,680
bad

277
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,920
um so in summary

278
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,320
cloud storage can store and replay voice

279
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,440
messages

280
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,680
they expose personal information of more

281
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,560
than

282
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,399
8 000 customers

283
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,519
800 000 customers and effectively turn

284
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,519
the toys into potential

285
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,519
spy devices

286
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,120
mozilla asked for a re-test of the

287
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,920
issues and we found that they didn't fix

288
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,839
much other than the mongodb without

289
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,720
authentication right

290
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,160
now the toys

291
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,079
thanks to mozilla are now removed from

292
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,880
amazon walmart and all the other shops

293
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,360
uh because after they retas nothing it

294
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
was found they fixed nothing so

295
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,920
it was basically shut down i think they

296
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,880
are hungry now so with this we finished

297
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,399
so let's talk about

298
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,279
the chinese police apps right so

299
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,399
here i'm going to talk about a couple of

300
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,839
apps that the chinese government uses on

301
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,519
these are called ijob and bxaaq

302
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,519
so they are used to evaluate the threat

303
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,000
level of their minority muslim

304
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,560
population in xinjiang right which is a

305
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,079
chinese

306
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,440
section

307
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,920
an area in china where there's more

308
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,839
people that are muslim for some reason

309
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,720
right and you can read about these here

310
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,800
so basically humans write watch

311
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
requested a project funded by the open

312
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,560
technology fund to report and document

313
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,240
the findings of the apps right to

314
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,959
investigate the potential violation of

315
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,600
human rights right this was the goal so

316
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,959
this is not

317
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,279
um a security that's like the previous

318
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,760
one this is more about uh what data are

319
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,519
they collecting uh

320
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,120
and all that kind of stuff so here we

321
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
were trying to answer the questions

322
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,240
from the human rights activists right so

323
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,399
the main question is is the system of

324
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,640
systems eye job

325
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,640
potentially compromising the human

326
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,360
rights of a minority chinese population

327
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,519
right so the main thing

328
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,959
um

329
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,200
so the integrated joints operation

330
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,240
platform or ijob is a listing program

331
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,160
based on big data analysis and the

332
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,639
program aggregates data about people

333
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,399
often without their knowledge it flags

334
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,839
data it deems potentially threatening to

335
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,440
officials um yeah you can read more

336
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,800
about this here

337
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,839
because

338
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,519
i'm not really into the politics i'm

339
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,839
more we were basically just answering

340
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,519
the questions that the human rights

341
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,720
activists

342
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,680
had

343
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,240
based on the technical evidence we found

344
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,000
on the application right

345
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,839
so to understand the political

346
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,000
background of this about what's going on

347
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,560
and the social background you can just

348
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,880
watch these demons

349
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,639
the human rights activists will explain

350
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,639
it better than me

351
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,560
so with this

352
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,160
let's start talking about the apps

353
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,680
themselves right so

354
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,560
um the ijob was originally developed by

355
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,079
china electronics technology group

356
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,320
corporation is a state-owned military

357
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,399
contractor the company was set up in

358
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,000
2017

359
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,920
as a research center

360
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,240
and they are primarily focused on areas

361
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,079
such as artificial intelligence mapping

362
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,880
and big data

363
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,160
so

364
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,079
first problem we had of course is we

365
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,320
spoke no chinese so we had to translate

366
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,000
the app right so basically what you do

367
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,800
here

368
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,880
you decompile the apk

369
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,200
and then translate the streams.xml with

370
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,040
google translate or similar

371
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,920
and then recompile the apk and you got

372
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,399
an apk in english more or less it's kind

373
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,320
of broken english but it's good enough

374
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,880
um to figure out what the application is

375
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,079
doing right

376
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,519
so apk tool excellent kind of stuff

377
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,200
another thing that we did was to set

378
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,279
footwork so

379
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,440
just to try to be a little bit more

380
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,639
stealthy

381
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,440
in case anything was uh you know like

382
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,199
the app was sending anything

383
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,959
back to their chinese servers or

384
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,279
something we just set up tour and tunnel

385
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,440
the traffic through tour so there's not

386
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,399
going to be uh any problem while we can

387
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,160
still inspect the traffic

388
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,199
uh without leaking or on ips as tester

389
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,880
right so that was what we and then

390
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,279
another problem we had is what is after

391
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,120
the login right because we have the apps

392
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,800
but we don't have credentials to logging

393
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,399
on these police servers

394
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,480
so we cannot log in and we don't know

395
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,639
how politically bad the information on

396
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,680
the screen is so we had to

397
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,360
hack the application

398
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,760
so that it would let us

399
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,399
see all the screens of the system

400
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,519
without being logged in and with this we

401
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,680
would be able to answer the questions

402
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,000
from the human rights activists right so

403
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,240
we modify the app to export all

404
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,440
activities

405
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
and provide the trick bill to the

406
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,959
activist to access all the activities

407
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,959
and then provide a list of adb commands

408
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,839
to activist to see the activities so

409
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,880
basically uh things that they could put

410
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,800
on the command line so that different

411
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
screens of the app would be launched and

412
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,720
then they could like inspect the screens

413
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,040
themselves because the human it's the

414
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,440
human right activists and not as the pen

415
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,680
testers really know if something is good

416
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,120
or bad and

417
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,440
new chinese as well right so we gave

418
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,000
them the broken english and the

419
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
chinese

420
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,040
proper chinese version

421
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,279
both with all activities exported so

422
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,440
that they could review and decide what

423
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,600
is bad and what is not bad right so

424
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,839
activists can now run the script to

425
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,399
review after logging screens quickly

426
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,160
even though we don't have credentials to

427
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,880
login on the system right so let's talk

428
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,120
about what we found

429
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,839
so there was for example collection of

430
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,000
blood type and political views

431
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,240
so the question was as follows recording

432
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,920
of height and blood type we want to know

433
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,519
to what extent the authorities can

434
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
justify this by saying this is all for

435
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,199
counter terrorism so far i see only a

436
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,959
few mentions of terrorism right so we

437
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,480
have to answer

438
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,360
questions like this right so

439
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,399
my job

440
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,560
a job up into indulges in data

441
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,600
collection

442
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,920
likely for anomaly detection

443
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,000
uh it is assumed that the goal of this

444
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,360
data collection is to have more

445
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,680
reference data namely to mine and gather

446
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,560
data on individuals with increases in

447
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,720
increasingly strong indicators

448
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,040
and data that does not match the

449
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,120
information from the headquarters may

450
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,199
reveal more suspicious and problematic

451
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,839
subsets of users actual people and

452
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,920
groups right so that is

453
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,720
uh if you take like ethics and privacy

454
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,240
and all these out

455
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,560
this makes sense for a government in

456
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,880
that to catch terrorism you want to look

457
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,199
for anomalies right so this is what they

458
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,880
seem to be doing

459
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,040
of course this kind of a privacy problem

460
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
there with the government having all

461
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,160
this information

462
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,279
but from the pragmatic uh idea of

463
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,399
catching the terrorists uh

464
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,880
depending on your principles uh it kind

465
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,720
of makes some sense right but that's

466
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,639
right

467
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,800
so this is some evidence about gathering

468
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,320
the height and the blood type

469
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,360
of people this is the application

470
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,680
gathering the the data right so high

471
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,959
blood type

472
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,359
political look so there's information

473
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,919
like that being gathered

474
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,919
and then another interesting thing was

475
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,760
they collect information about the

476
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,959
electricity consumption right so why

477
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,439
why are they collecting information

478
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,079
about electricity consumption so this is

479
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,199
um

480
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,520
this is the take from human rights watch

481
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,119
so it is problematic because the

482
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,640
authorities are logging everyone's

483
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,559
electricity use they are trying to see

484
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,000
if there's a reason

485
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,559
for abnormal level of electricity use

486
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,720
and the application employs a database

487
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,440
with which fetches various utility data

488
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,360
about an individual

489
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,640
right so

490
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,039
uh again

491
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,679
from a privacy perspective this is bad

492
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,320
but if you try to catch a

493
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,799
terrorist or something funny going on

494
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,480
if somebody is using 10 times more

495
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,840
electricity

496
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,520
than other people

497
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,679
then maybe something is going going on

498
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,679
and maybe this is why they are doing it

499
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,640
right so it's speculation

500
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,320
so

501
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,760
yeah the app receives electricity

502
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,640
consumption data from the headquarters a

503
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,440
police officer receives a new task

504
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,039
and then the police officer can file a

505
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,039
report to investigate

506
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,280
the occurrence of unusual power

507
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,360
consumption right so if something

508
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,760
somebody is using too much electricity

509
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,440
they can go there and check what's going

510
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,640
on

511
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
so they can do so at any given date and

512
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,880
mark any reasons for the same which

513
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,320
prepares the ground for further

514
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
investigation by the public security

515
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,679
agency

516
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,760
now in case of a false positive the

517
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,840
officer can file in the actual

518
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,320
electricity matter value and a

519
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
justification by law enforcement might

520
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,039
be to monitor the use of electricity for

521
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,600
cryptocurrency mining growing cannabis

522
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,640
indoors or maybe other reasons right so

523
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,559
these types of activities can lead to

524
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,000
increased

525
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
consumption

526
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,320
and this is uh what it looks like from a

527
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,840
broken english

528
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,640
app

529
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,720
right so you can see

530
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,559
they are pretty much gathering flood

531
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,919
information

532
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,919
so here there's an ethical question

533
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,120
right like what do you think like should

534
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,280
the government be able to monitor how

535
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,600
much electricity everybody uses is this

536
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,440
a privacy intrusion

537
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
and can this stop terrorist attacks

538
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,520
right so this is kind of the balance

539
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,120
you need to strike

540
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,200
depending on where you live

541
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,039
you might

542
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,880
think in one way or another right i mean

543
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,400
it's all

544
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,520
a fine

545
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,039
balance to work right because on one

546
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,039
hand you want to catch the terrorists

547
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,480
but i'm not sure

548
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,039
if the terrorists are going to use

549
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,000
too much electricity or not so

550
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,200
at the same time you're gathering a lot

551
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,520
of information on citizens so it uh you

552
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,440
know something to think about this mods

553
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,760
an easy thing to answer right

554
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,679
now reporting feature for problematic

555
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,960
tools

556
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,320
they have doubts about the tools

557
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,160
specifically the tools they use and

558
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,919
process an option under electronic

559
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,039
appears to refer to problematic tools

560
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,400
this includes tools that may be

561
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,880
implemented to make explosives right so

562
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,840
maybe that makes more sense of terrorism

563
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,440
i'm not sure

564
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,760
so officers can submit a report to the

565
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
headquarters about explosive materials

566
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,840
and tools an officer can ask for

567
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,760
investigation of the matter and this

568
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,480
investigation can be further handed over

569
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,400
and carried on by the public security

570
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,960
agency right so this is how this look

571
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,080
like

572
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,960
um

573
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
yeah so

574
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,640
what you have to bear in mind is that

575
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,480
the eye drop is much more than the app

576
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
itself so this is all

577
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,440
like this all fits into the central

578
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,520
system that they have and they

579
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,080
use with big data and all this so

580
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,720
this is correlated right so the ijob app

581
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,960
is the app that police officers use and

582
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,919
and they

583
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,440
that they use to gather information and

584
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,280
stuff but then this is correlated with

585
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,520
the cctv cameras with facial recognition

586
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,919
and night vision so they know

587
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,400
where everybody is at any point in time

588
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,200
as soon as soon as a camera catches them

589
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,280
then this wi-fi sniffers that track

590
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
computers smartphones and other network

591
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,559
devices

592
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,720
to see for example what they are what

593
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,360
kind of ssids they are probing and stuff

594
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,520
they correlate all this data as well

595
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,280
and then they also check like license

596
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,200
plate numbers cities and id card card

597
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,120
numbers and stuff like this

598
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,039
of course um

599
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,320
vehicle

600
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,080
ownership health insurance family

601
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
planning banking and legal records right

602
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,639
so there's all these

603
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,480
this information goes into a central

604
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,240
database and they correlate all this

605
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,360
right so

606
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,039
a few checks on police surveillance

607
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,320
powers

608
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,799
no effective privacy about

609
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,480
against government

610
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,120
instructions in china and china has no

611
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,679
unified privacy or data protection law

612
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,200
to protect

613
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,280
personally identifying information from

614
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,200
misuse right so they are really not

615
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,799
breaking any laws because they make the

616
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,280
laws and that's how they roll

617
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,000
but from a european or u.s perspective

618
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,679
this is kind of viewed in a different

619
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,159
light so there's always these cultural

620
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,600
differences

621
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,000
uh let's call them that right uh there

622
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,919
is very little information available

623
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,240
about how securely the data is collected

624
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,159
the data collected by this system is

625
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,559
stored and there's no formal system for

626
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,640
people to find out what information is

627
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,799
being held about them in niger right so

628
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,280
for a comparison in europe

629
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,080
any individual can request a company to

630
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,240
delete all the personal information from

631
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,320
the database and the company

632
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,120
has to do it right as long as

633
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,520
there's no uh a law requirement for it

634
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,799
right

635
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,799
so we have very different laws than in

636
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,919
europe and this is how the wi-fi

637
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,280
scanners

638
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,400
play right so when you walk through

639
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,240
the underground or something

640
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,840
there's wi-fi scanners everywhere and

641
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,520
they

642
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,960
get all that so

643
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,600
it is unclear how the hijab and police

644
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,840
cloud are related it's unclear

645
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,159
if and how the ijob connects to other

646
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,559
databases on people

647
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,480
uh yeah and it's capable of collecting

648
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,840
and managing

649
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,760
a lot of information on very specific

650
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,200
data right so

651
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,440
the application has a tracking power

652
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,120
over uh

653
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,360
energy consumption and the recording of

654
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,840
political views and the religious uh

655
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,000
atmosphere right so

656
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,200
yeah this is all like a fine line right

657
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,679
so the review was uh was carried out in

658
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,280
close collaboration with the human

659
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,320
rights

660
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,840
rights watch team

661
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
and at the same time it should be noted

662
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,080
that we operated uh purely as a

663
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,960
technically driven team an unbiased

664
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,440
investigating entity right so

665
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,480
all the ethics and the you know

666
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,080
what is right and what is wrong and all

667
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,919
that we didn't really get into that we

668
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,400
were only answering questions from human

669
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,640
rights right so they had some questions

670
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,880
and we technically tried to answer them

671
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,559
but that's pretty much it right so we

672
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,000
worked on a premise of technical

673
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,080
evidence based on reverse engineering

674
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,919
operations

675
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,600
so yeah and this is um

676
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,799
so now let's take a look at a different

677
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,559
kind of app right so the other app is an

678
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,960
app that police officers would have like

679
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,720
to spit out information and collecting

680
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,600
information about users like final forms

681
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,720
and this is a different app the bx eq is

682
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,279
more about uh

683
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,200
you cross the border and then they

684
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,880
install this app on your phone and then

685
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
they grab all their contacts all the

686
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,480
information on the phone and then they

687
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,440
upload it to some police server right so

688
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,360
this is a bit different in that they are

689
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,520
actually installing an app on the phone

690
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,240
to extract all the information

691
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
from the phone that they want

692
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,720
so this is used in specific regions of

693
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,039
china by law enforcement personnel and

694
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,200
has the potential to gather and must

695
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
manage massive amount of data about

696
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,880
specific

697
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,919
right so this is a quick small but this

698
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,600
uh

699
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,520
yeah and i think i'm pretty much over if

700
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
we take a into account the time of the

701
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,159
demo so basically

702
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,039
um we reverse the app

703
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,360
and we look at what kind of information

704
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,159
was being collected so i'm going to skip

705
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,640
over this but it basically collected

706
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
this is the

707
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,559
entries phone contacts country codes

708
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,080
dialed numbers

709
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,600
uh all the identifiers of the device the

710
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,679
android model text messages sent and

711
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,200
received

712
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,039
so yeah so pretty much is an app that

713
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,720
they installed and gather all the

714
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
information from the phone uh and

715
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,840
download right and this i will have to

716
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,679
skip over so you have time to watch

717
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,679
demos

718
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,559
but yeah it's pretty much

719
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,000
pretty much that right so

720
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,120
uh so yeah two applications uh i drop on

721
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,720
the xaq one the police use it to fill

722
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,279
out forms and stuff and bxeq

723
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,600
they use it to store it on the phone and

724
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,440
get the data from there

725
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,080
so human rights watch these uh raised

726
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,720
concerns uh and their reports produce

727
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,360
reflected highly on the loopholes in all

728
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
of the systems

729
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,679
but yeah we were

730
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,000
like technically driven and just trying

731
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,080
to answer questions so we didn't get

732
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,880
into

733
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,120
uh politics and stuff

734
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,039
so with this if you have any questions

735
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,679
since this is recorded you can

736
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,919
shoot me an email and i'll do my best to

737
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,120
answer

738
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,559
uh and that's it and if you are

739
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,080

740
