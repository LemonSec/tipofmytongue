00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,240
i'm timor

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,200
uh

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,400
this is my three minutes or so prelude

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,359
to our joint talk with peter who is the

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,160
major speaker here and the

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,800
major mind behind the

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,359
program we suggest

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,720
the topic of our discussion is the

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,960
many times missing organizational

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,800
let's say glue

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,719
needed to make

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,879
the elements of application security

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,480
more solid

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,399
set up together

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,280
the glue which is also required to

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,039
reproduce and evolve application

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,640
security

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,719
in that better form that we suggest

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,280
in the common terms we tackle the topic

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,320
of

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,400
maturity

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,240
quality assurance and also champions

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,840
when i'm recording this we are already

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,799
done with our discussions with peter

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,000
let me prelude it with main

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,479
points

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,880
the slides are difficult

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,840
i

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,000
expect you to return to these slides

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,960
later

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,330
or

35
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,840
[Music]

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,360
contact us

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,520
via the feedback form

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,200
which is linked as a

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,640
qr code

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,759
on the last slide

41
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,439
so we approach software production teams

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,680
and departments as an organism

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,320
we assume that organizational structures

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,880
and routines surrounding application

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,399
security are weak

46
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,040
of course there are exceptions

47
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,880
and best practices so don't get offended

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,680
the question opening this approach is

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,520
why should

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,720
security skills routines and quality

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
assurance be treated

52
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,480
on the organizational level differently

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,840
not like

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,200
we otherwise do in software production

55
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,520
there is a new uwa sperm

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,120
thingy

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,360
called integration standard

58
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,760
that's a noaa's project

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
check it out

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,680
it intermingles the arsenal of

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,640
application security into one structured

62
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,280
and an actionable map

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,480
and

64
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,160
it's this map it also shows the place of

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,519
our topic

66
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,120
it calls its

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,640
culture building and process maturing

68
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,720
what is missing there

69
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,840
is the approach of organizational

70
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,560
development

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,680
note that as it is now

72
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,879
it expects an engineerish approach

73
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,560
to the

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,680
field

75
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
that we are talking about

76
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,519
while we suggest

77
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,519
to look at the field

78
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,760
of culture and maturity as an issue of

79
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,400
structured collective behavior

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,239
which is to reproduce and improve

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,840
based on

82
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,920
internal mindset and dispositions

83
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,040
so the solution in our opinion is to

84
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,680
nurture this field using organizational

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,959
development instruments

86
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,360
we can already translate this

87
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,720
into into an actionable

88
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,480
organizational development slash ssdlc

89
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,680
program

90
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,920
though the details are not

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,280
a subject

92
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,640
of this presentation

93
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,400
also please

94
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,159
be patient with the glitches during the

95
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,360
following discussion this was our first

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,358
try to introduce

97
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,399
the

98
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,279
program so now we are

99
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,199
together with

100
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,199
peter nilashi who is the major figure

101
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,479
behind this

102
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,720
idea program concept model whatever

103
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,440
whatever yeah

104
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,560
hi

105
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,000
so in my introduction i try to explain

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,680
what is the map on which we are uh

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,639
trying to find the the missing

108
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,040
glue of organizational uh

109
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,479
measures uh

110
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,479
uh which are uh

111
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,000
which are to

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,720
uh enable all these components which are

113
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,360
originally like engineered to engineer

114
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,960
uh designed

115
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,320
but lacking this organizational uh glue

116
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,199
again

117
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,199
uh which is uh essentially our

118
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,120
proposal today

119
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,919
to add this glue to the organizational

120
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,400
uh treatment of security

121
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
and

122
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,720
it's important to mention that

123
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,440
many other organizations

124
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,880
may have this glue already and it it

125
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,560
could have

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,600
been created organically or naturally

127
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,800
and uh the the the point of our uh

128
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
talk today and and the program that we

129
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,800
uh propose

130
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,560
is how to implement it uh

131
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,680
methodologically so how

132
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,039
a software development workshop uh

133
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,400
like a team or a big organization uh

134
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
could uh

135
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,440
take uh our advice and implement uh

136
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,160
those missing on the organizational glue

137
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
thingies

138
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,600
but first of all let us explain uh

139
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,120
why this organizational aspect is

140
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,120
important at all why all those uh

141
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,440
engineering made when engineers created

142
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,560
made components of application security

143
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,400
why they doesn't

144
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,360
work

145
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,160
or

146
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,400
what is missing

147
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,080
for

148
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,800
the

149
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,720
educational

150
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,120
process of uh security or let's say for

151
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,840
uh security assurance uh within the

152
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,080
software development process

153
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,639
yeah yeah so it took me some time to to

154
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,080
realize that

155
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,639
that security quality is something that

156
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,759
depends

157
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,639
more

158
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,520
on the organizational structure more on

159
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
the roles of the organizational

160
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,639
structure on the rules of the

161
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,680
organization on the processes that the

162
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,599
organization have

163
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,759
on the

164
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,319
scripts that the organization have so

165
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,479
security quality depends more on all

166
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,800
these things than many other aspects of

167
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,199
software quality okay

168
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,479
higher

169
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,120
organization is structured height is

170
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,319
organized it doesn't matter

171
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,319
but it does matter of course in every

172
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,880
every every aspect of software

173
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,319
development but

174
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,479
actually it matters less in many other

175
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,479
fields of software development than in

176
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,319
security okay

177
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,120
now

178
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,759
why is it so and

179
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,080
so i so i believe that there are

180
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,520
probably three

181
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,319
important reasons okay

182
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,400
the first reason is that

183
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,960
security is a typical weakest link

184
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,160
problem

185
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,039
the

186
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,160
weakest

187
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,440
developer you have security wise

188
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,919
it will determine the overall security

189
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,680
quality of your software simply okay if

190
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,560
you just have one junior developer who

191
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,120
never heard about sql injection then you

192
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,520
have a great chance that this developer

193
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,120
will introduce a sql injection

194
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
vulnerability into your software unless

195
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,919
you're actually developer is the weakest

196
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,560
link of uh yes security

197
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,199
flow yes yes yes yes yes

198
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,319
definitely

199
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,720
unless of course you have a candy can

200
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
they can they can be unless you have a

201
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,840
really good

202
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,919
organizational structure which prevents

203
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,720
this developer somehow which which you

204
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,479
know

205
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,679
draws the light lines and

206
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,679
prevents this developer to introduce it

207
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,599
by you know

208
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,360
mandating

209
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,719
code review

210
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,679
or

211
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,360
by

212
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,880
mandating uh

213
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,000
the usage of automatic tools and the

214
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,920
interpretation of those twos and so on

215
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,000
and so on so there must be like a

216
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,839
structure

217
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,640
and a set of

218
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,800
regularities that work yes on the on the

219
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,360
gut level and on the conscious level yes

220
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,800
which uh i prevent

221
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,519
the weakest link the developer from

222
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,120
being a root cause of uh security

223
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,040
problems right yes yes yes yeah

224
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,200
definitely so does the that's the first

225
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
thing the weakest link uh the weakest

226
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,680
link problem is one reason why uh we

227
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,200
have to deal with security on the

228
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,440
organizational level the other the

229
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,320
second thing is is how knowledge spreads

230
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,680
okay

231
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,320
in in technology and in i.t

232
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
we got used to

233
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,760
the fact that

234
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,240
several types of i.t knowledge spread

235
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,800
very very efficiently okay if if

236
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,600
if

237
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,399
i write a software component which i

238
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,519
don't know solves some complicated task

239
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,360
then all the other developers can just

240
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,680
take that component and incorporate into

241
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,839
their software code and they can use it

242
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,560
without you know uh without knowing

243
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,040
deeply the component they can just just

244
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,360
use it very efficiently okay

245
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,320
that's that that's quite similar to to

246
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,320
how technology works you know someone

247
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,720
created this phone

248
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,000
or this notebook but i who use this

249
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,760
notebook i don't have to understand how

250
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,839
it works you know internally and don't

251
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,880
have to understand all the all the

252
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,680
uh internals of of my knowledge book i

253
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,839
shouldn't i certainly wouldn't be able

254
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,640
to

255
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,040
create this notebook actually it wasn't

256
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,279
made by one person it was made by a

257
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,800
merry person

258
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,480
and probably none of them fully

259
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,399
understands how it works so software

260
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,880
development terms you know the interface

261
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,279
to it and it can be a black box yeah yes

262
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,279
yes yes definitely which which also if

263
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,880
you see it from another perspective it

264
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,279
means that that somehow the fruits of

265
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
knowledge spread very fast and

266
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,640
efficiently okay someone

267
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,720
understands the problem and creates a

268
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,800
solution for it and suddenly everyone

269
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,680
else can just use that solution okay

270
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,720
but in security it doesn't work that way

271
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,399
because because

272
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,240
it doesn't really matter even if you if

273
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,320
you have a lot of security knowledge no

274
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,399
all kind of vulnerabilities no all kind

275
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,480
of architecture

276
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,720
security pitfalls it won't help the

277
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,000
other developer to to avoid the same

278
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,399
pitfalls okay it just doesn't it just

279
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,279
doesn't spread easily uh

280
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,880
you spend i don't know years to to to or

281
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,120
masses to understand uh what the

282
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,560
security aspects of your of your job and

283
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,120
still the other developer doesn't

284
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,040
instantly benefit from your knowledge

285
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,279
okay

286
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,920
two security uh uh together in this

287
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,240
explanation because on one

288
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,000
one is that uh everyone can introduce a

289
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,360
serious security problem yes which will

290
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,720
which may not be uh encountered

291
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,839
in the worst case scenario and the other

292
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,320
is this dissemination of the know of of

293
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,079
knowledge yes so

294
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,399
is it that the knowledge should be equal

295
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,920
because it shouldn't be

296
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,600
so the knowledge should be structured

297
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,839
yes definitely it's it's it's uh

298
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,320
unrealistic to to expect every developer

299
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,040
to know every everything about security

300
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,120
but at least everyone should know the

301
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,720
basics that he or she has to know in in

302
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,959
in his

303
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,279
field okay and also we should have rules

304
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,880
which ensure

305
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,519
uh security quality further okay for

306
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,680
example rule is about code reviewing

307
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,760
okay yeah so we are talking about kind

308
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,160
of uh

309
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,399
security controls

310
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,399
on the on the process on the

311
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,720
organizational level yes

312
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,560
yes definitely and there is a third

313
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,399
third reason why

314
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,760
we have to treat security on the

315
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,440
organizational level and that's that

316
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,160
security is a typical attention problem

317
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,600
okay

318
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,839
even if you know a lot about security

319
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,000
when you write your code or when you

320
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,959
design your application or even when you

321
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,519
test your application most likely you

322
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,320
will focus on the functionality okay and

323
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,440
not on the security aspect of of what

324
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,279
it even happens with with security

325
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,079
experts that they write a code and they

326
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,560
introduce a vulnerability and they kind

327
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,040
of have to you know shift their

328
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,639
attention and check that code once again

329
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,519
now with the you know security expert

330
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,399
hat on them to realize that they just

331
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,800
introduced uh security vulnerability so

332
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,160
the problem is that normally when you

333
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,079
write the code or when you when you

334
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,120
design uh the application you focus so

335
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,959
much on functionality that you totally

336
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,959
forget about security and again or

337
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,560
rather you outsource or delegate

338
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,680
this uh part of attention to specialized

339
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,519
people yeah like to pentesters or

340
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,839
whatever yeah i think it's it's another

341
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,800
problem when you trust too much

342
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,920
that um you know pentesters will later

343
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,199
fix everything

344
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,720
uh yes so so again some organizational

345
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,680
roles can help here because if you know

346
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,800
there is a process which says that

347
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
in this and this and this part of the

348
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,360
development process you have to

349
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,920
care about security if there are some

350
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,040
roles which mandate then i don't know in

351
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,360
every group and in every meeting there

352
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,600
is someone who is responsible for

353
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,040
security then then it helps uh

354
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,760
helps people to to to do this attention

355
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,959
shift yeah actually the original idea of

356
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,399
microsoft

357
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,120
uh when they invented this security

358
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,959
champion uh notion or role it was that

359
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,399
someone has to represent security at

360
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,120
every meeting like uh uh

361
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,199
yes exactly

362
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,399
like a special actor at the at the the

363
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,160
greek drama and yes yeah yes yes exactly

364
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,279
because of the

365
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,279
attention program okay so i think

366
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,720
these are these are these are three

367
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,199
important things to to to to remember

368
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,040
and and you have to understand it

369
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,399
because when you understand it you

370
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,160
understand that security is not just an

371
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,279
individual

372
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,440
problem it's not just about teaching

373
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,320
developers it's also also about changing

374
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,240
some things on the organizational level

375
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,279
the question is dan after we introduced

376
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,519
it uh

377
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,360
that it's important to have the

378
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,519
organizational aspect

379
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,440
uh the glue uh

380
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,040
what are the

381
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,680
measures you know what is what is the

382
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,399
content of uh the program that uh

383
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,880
the proposal you propose yes yes yes yes

384
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,279
so let's first define the goals or

385
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,959
trying to define the goals it's a it's

386
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,800
important

387
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
what are the main goals of of

388
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,240
that we want to achieve by

389
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,000
you know

390
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,360
doing something on the organization

391
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,720
level so so i collected five of those

392
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,240
those goals

393
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,880
and the first goal is no code gets into

394
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,519
production without some security review

395
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,759
okay that's that's that's very important

396
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,279
because that's you know that's just the

397
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,839
weakest link that just uh follows from

398
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,000
the weakest link problem if

399
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,560
some developers codes get into

400
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,880
production without anybody reviewing it

401
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,120
then there is a high chance that

402
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,560
you will introduce

403
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,800
security vulnerability

404
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,360
into your project okay and doesn't

405
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,279
automated checking uh help it well yes

406
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,800
it can help it can happen i don't

407
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,639
believe that it solves all the problems

408
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,880
but yes it can help of of course but

409
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,639
that's also part of the you know the

410
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,040
organizational

411
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,399
organizational process so yes i believe

412
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,800
that you have to do automated checkings

413
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,199
and you also have to do a code review by

414
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,040
another person but now you are

415
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,720
advocating for uh everyday uh uh

416
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,160
code reviews yes

417
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,920
and every day uh

418
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
uh security related course yes right

419
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,360
definitely definitely

420
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,400
yeah yeah i wanted to to focus uh or

421
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,160
emphasize it in the last part but yes

422
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,559
that's how how this goal can be achieved

423
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,359
i believe with uh with the routinely

424
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,559
done code review and of course could

425
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,079
this overhead be reasoned

426
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,640
yes i believe yes yes so if i was a

427
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,839
product manager what how could you

428
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,079
convince me that

429
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,200
precious development time should be like

430
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,360
yeah i believe that most most most most

431
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,679
ways for it yeah but i i believe that

432
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,600
most software development companies

433
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,360
start to understand that code review is

434
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,120
necessary anyway not just for the

435
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,960
security of the application but also for

436
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
the overall quality of the

437
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,280
of the of the code and the overall

438
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,400
quality of the code is it's it's always

439
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,080
worse you know to to to uh to put some

440
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,760
effort into it it always comes back it

441
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,679
seems like it's a time it's a waste of

442
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,160
time but it isn't in the beginning it

443
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,679
looks like that but

444
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,600
after you know

445
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,679
a year of development

446
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,600
there is a huge difference between good

447
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
quality code and probably i would say

448
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,480
that there are churches like one church

449
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,160
believes in the code review and the

450
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,000
other doesn't so

451
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,559
you are preaching in the church

452
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,160
of security

453
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
believers at least everyone believes

454
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,320
today in in code quality and everyone

455
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,559
knows that it's important it's it's a

456
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,480
it's an orange that is this is a

457
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,120
it's a major knowledge everyone knows it

458
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,480
however we rarely uh met a good quality

459
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,160
right well it depends on how you measure

460
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,440
but yeah

461
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,080
yeah i believe it's uh

462
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,760
okay so one one of the major uh measures

463
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,679
that

464
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,559
is part of this

465
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,919
method

466
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,120
or or

467
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,679
set of methods is a

468
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,160
security code review on daily basis

469
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,039
right yes definitely so what others

470
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,720
we propose maybe we can we can um

471
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,960
[Music]

472
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,120
we can list the goals

473
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,600
first okay if you don't mind

474
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,360
um so the first first goal was no code

475
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,880
gets into production without summer

476
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,280
reviewing it the second is security

477
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
should be part of the design the

478
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,679
implementation the testing and the

479
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,679
follow-up okay that's that sounds

480
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,760
trivial but it's important to to

481
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,840
emphasize it that it should be part of

482
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,640
every part of development

483
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,240
forever so sure what's different

484
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,000
no difference it's just it's just

485
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,080
important to to make it sure that that's

486
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,480
our goal okay we are finding the right

487
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,919
ways uh

488
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,640
for

489
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,500
uh

490
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,799
[Music]

491
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,720
we are we are trying to understand how

492
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,679
to

493
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,360
and what to change in the organizational

494
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,760
level to achieve this goal okay

495
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
that that security is part of every

496
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,640
phase of software development it's not

497
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,480
just in the testing phase it's not just

498
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,559
in the implementation phase it's also in

499
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,320
the design phase and also you it is also

500
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,280
there during the follow-up period

501
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,720
when the software is already in

502
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,120
production and the

503
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,520
customer is just using it okay so it

504
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,480
should be

505
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,600
should be everywhere it should be

506
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,760
ubiquitous

507
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,840
third goal is that every developer

508
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,159
should understand at least the basics of

509
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,679
security that he or she needs during

510
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,480
his or her work okay

511
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,200
we should somehow answer it again on the

512
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,799
on the uh

513
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,200
on the organizational level that every

514
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,120
dev gets the right uh kind of education

515
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,600
the minimal education that he or she

516
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,120
needs okay

517
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,880
we have two more goals

518
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,640
there are some people who maintain and

519
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,799
understand how to automatic tools okay

520
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,640
because automatic tools are great but if

521
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,400
nobody interprets them

522
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
they are they they are of no use

523
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,159
obviously okay

524
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,679
if you just run your

525
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,120
code checking and your code checking

526
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
gives you a lot of

527
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
problems but you don't react to it it

528
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,400
doesn't doesn't help you need some

529
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
people who understand and able to

530
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,240
interpret it knows

531
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,840
which are the false positives which are

532
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,320
the true positives which

533
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,640
ones have to handle by i don't know

534
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,559
upgrading one of your components which

535
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,720
one have to uh um handled by by doing

536
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,760
some work around and so on and so on

537
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,919
then the fourth one and the fifth one is

538
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:28,720
uh

539
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,039
yes this is the fusion the last one and

540
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,720
our last goal is that uh there should be

541
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,480
some security experts within the

542
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,039
organization who understand architecture

543
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,960
and advanced topics okay so i'm not

544
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,600
saying that everyone has to has to

545
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,000
be a security expert that's that that's

546
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,080
important that while i believe that

547
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,000
everyone should have some basic

548
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,520
knowledge of security i don't think

549
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,679
everyone has to be a security expert but

550
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,600
there should be some security experts

551
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,640
within within the organization okay who

552
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,720
can help the others when they have and

553
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,120
they have a question and who can who can

554
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,039
decide in architectural uh situations

555
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,240
and we call those security champions

556
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,960
yes because we we we actually i actually

557
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,280
believe that that they should have a uh

558
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,000
separate uh uh

559
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,559
security champion role okay

560
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,400
they should be the security champion

561
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,280
architects or the secretary

562
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,760
the reviewer champion

563
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,360
so let's finish

564
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,559
with the explanation of the solution

565
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,080
right yes yes yes yes or at least some

566
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,720
some some suggestions or proposals there

567
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,840
or for for a possible solution actually

568
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,000
peter has a medium

569
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,760
article

570
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
dedicated to this uh

571
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,799
problem and it will be included

572
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,960
and you can follow the

573
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,799
the link which we provide in the

574
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,840
feedback form and uh there will be a

575
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,960
link

576
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,480
to this content

577
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,919
yes so obviously one one um

578
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,200
part of

579
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,559
of

580
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,880
security still has to be education

581
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,960
education is very important you have to

582
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,159
if you have a company you have to

583
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,960
educate your your developers

584
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
so that they can learn

585
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,679
how to produce better more secure code

586
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,919
okay and the thing is that you have to

587
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,640
do it regularly and you have to do it as

588
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,600
early as you can whenever a new

589
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,480
developer enters your company

590
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,720
you should do it as early as you can

591
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,280
obviously because until uh the developer

592
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,000
learns about the most important

593
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,440
security things

594
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,200
there is a chance that

595
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,000
that

596
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,360
he is writing

597
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,480
you know one rebel code also one

598
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,000
other important thing is that that uh

599
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,760
related to education is that you have to

600
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,840
understand what is it what is this is

601
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,520
the basic thing that every developer

602
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,200
should know okay you have to

603
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,360
differentiate between between basic

604
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,200
security knowledge and more advanced

605
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,400
security technology i had this

606
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,240
experience that um in many um you know

607
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,760
soft uh security courses um

608
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,720
we actually teach all kind of things

609
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,799
basic things and mature things together

610
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,039
that's what we also do because that's

611
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,720
what uh that's what

612
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,400
that's what people want that's what

613
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,240
that's what they need

614
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,799
and that's okay you can do it in in one

615
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,640
course you can you can teach it in one

616
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
class but still

617
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,159
you know it should be separated it

618
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,720
should be differentiated uh everyone

619
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,559
should know that okay these are the most

620
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,159
important things that every junior

621
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,000
developer has to do and these are more

622
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,240
advanced things that not everybody has

623
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,440
to know these are more like

624
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,679
architectural stuffs okay

625
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,320
these these two kind of uh knowledge

626
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,840
should be should be separated well i

627
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,840
think it's it's important to

628
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,440
something which which you know deep

629
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,840
which is deep related to education is is

630
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,240
the problem of documentation okay

631
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,640
and it's very difficult to have good

632
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,120
documentation everybody knows that you

633
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,640
have documentation uh fine but if nobody

634
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,120
reads the documentation it is of no no

635
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,080
use obviously so what you need in in

636
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,000
security is some kind of develop

637
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,039
documentation that is um

638
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,600
simple enough to search you know so that

639
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,840
the developer can use it during

640
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,360
his or her

641
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,720
work okay on a daily base like oh i've

642
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,799
wrote this software i wrote this piece

643
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,039
of code okay now i know that i have to

644
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,679
do a security check um

645
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,520
okay so what are exactly the checks that

646
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,880
i have to do let's check the

647
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,360
documentation and then the developer

648
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,400
should be able to search the

649
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,799
documentation based on

650
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,080
on what what she did today she should

651
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,039
get a

652
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,799
kind of a checklist that okay then i

653
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,799
have to check this this this and this uh

654
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,200
from a security perspective okay i'm not

655
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,880
saying that it's easy to create such a

656
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,559
documentation

657
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,080
but it it it it is essential if you want

658
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,000
a good security knowledge one good

659
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,960
framework is uh is skf the security

660
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,720
knowledge framework which is actually

661
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,120
software and which helps a lot in in in

662
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,919
this

663
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,440
uh this task that's um that's one of the

664
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,080
main main goal of sk hello to our

665
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,520
friends yes

666
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,159
yes yes yes yes

667
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,840
we are probably a little bit biased

668
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,480
towards skf but uh we really believe

669
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,400
that it's a good good software which can

670
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
be used exactly for this purpose but

671
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,679
whatever whatever works for you use that

672
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,279
have some good documentation some

673
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,840
documentation that is no no i think that

674
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,080
the in the cupboard forever but it's

675
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,840
used really well yeah and they are

676
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,640
emphasizing in on the good documentation

677
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,600
or or well implemented uh documentation

678
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,640
because

679
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,039
there are like

680
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,240
absolute believers in that documentation

681
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,120
doesn't work in software development and

682
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,880
people never

683
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,640
check documentation they go to

684
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,120
stack overflow or wherever but they

685
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,559
don't check the documentation so skf is

686
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,320
important in that it tries to be like an

687
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,960
embedded uh knowledge yeah

688
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,000
and

689
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,240
yeah they're emphasizing the on the on

690
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,880
the actionable knowledge right yes

691
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,039
yes yes yes yes yes yes

692
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,640
we call it documentation but it's more

693
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,520
like more like policy of of on on how to

694
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,559
write

695
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,039
secure software okay

696
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,640
not to go the wrong way yes yes yes yes

697
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,120
definitely then of course one very

698
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
important thing is code review we are

699
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,520
already we already talked about it uh in

700
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,360
the previous section but yeah just let's

701
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,200
just repeat it once more you have to do

702
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,760
code review you have to do it regularly

703
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,919
and you have to do a code review from a

704
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,240
security point of view okay so that

705
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,440
means that

706
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,240
that

707
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,080
every every code that goes into

708
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,919
production have to be checked at least

709
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,640
by another person okay and who this

710
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,880
other person should be let's see it in

711
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,919
the next

712
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,360
next um

713
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,520
slide show or maybe

714
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,399
uh

715
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,760
right after the next

716
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,919
so the next is is about security

717
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,520
champions

718
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,760
i believe or we believe that security

719
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,799
champions are it's a good system

720
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,120
and we believe that actually it can be

721
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,240
somewhat made somewhat more subtle

722
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,960
uh to achieve those specific goals that

723
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,039
that we have listed in the previous

724
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,120
sections so we suggested actually four

725
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,200
different security champion roles let's

726
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
see what these are the first is the

727
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,279
reviewer champion or we can call it the

728
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,240
architect champion

729
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,799
the names are you know flexible uh the

730
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,039
the reviewer champion is the one who

731
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,399
knows a lot about security

732
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,240
uh understands

733
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,799
uh understands uh

734
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,440
security problems deeply

735
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,440
we call it we call him or her the

736
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,520
reviewer champion because he's the one

737
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,799
who should be called if there is any

738
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,360
doubt during the security uh during the

739
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,919
code review okay so one developer writes

740
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,919
a code another reviews it and the other

741
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,720
is is a bit unsure whether this is which

742
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,000
is this is secure this is this is uh

743
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,120
vulnerable or not he might not know it

744
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,520
perfectly uh

745
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,880
in this case they should call the

746
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,120
security reviewer champion who should

747
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,840
have the the right knowledge to you know

748
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,279
uh uh

749
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,760
make a positive yeah sure it's like uh

750
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,440
probably like the first line support uh

751
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,760
for uh security uh issues is the code

752
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,480
review and the second line is the yes

753
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,520
that kind of uh security champion yes

754
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,320
yes yes also the role of this the the

755
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,200
reviewer champion can be can can also be

756
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,720
educating

757
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,559
new developers okay

758
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,480
it can be done by by uh you know

759
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,720
specific teachers but it probably it can

760
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,600
also be done by by the reviewer champion

761
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,200
and the the education also the reviewer

762
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,559
champion should

763
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,600
uh

764
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,640
or the reviewer champions should be um

765
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,720
responsible for the documentation okay

766
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,799
because they know secretary best so they

767
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,480
should write the documentation or the

768
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,399
policies uh in skf or in whatever

769
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,640
form and they do so so they have a lot

770
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,039
of responsibility they have a lot of

771
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,320
stuff to do and they should uh have

772
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,880
a major knowledge of security then we

773
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,840
have this design champion okay the

774
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,399
design champion is someone who is

775
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,039
responsible for security in the design

776
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,760
phase the design champion surprisingly

777
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,799
doesn't

778
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,679
necessarily have to be as competent in

779
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,360
security as the reviewer champion

780
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,120
because the the role of the design

781
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,799
champion is more a formal law role like

782
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,159
in the original uh concept of um of the

783
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,760
security champion

784
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,279
concept

785
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,120
it's just that you know during the

786
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,279
design phase the security

787
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,080
the the design champion should always

788
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,760
uh bring security into the focus like

789
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,880
okay so we design it this way is it

790
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,880
going to be safe is it going to be

791
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,399
secure have we talked about uh security

792
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,480
okay so we are going to buy the new

793
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,120
let some source code from the

794
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,519
user because it sounds fun and then we

795
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,840
will just you know run it in the

796
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,880
system but is it safe is it safe can we

797
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,360
do it safely and then

798
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,120
it's not the the role of the design

799
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,799
champion to answer the question but i

800
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,480
think at least should

801
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,279
he should bring it to the table you know

802
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,279
and then others they said we say okay

803
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,440
we'll somehow do it safely or no there's

804
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,840
no way to do it safely or whatever

805
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,399
and the third role is the devops

806
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,760
champion okay so we believe that that we

807
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,919
need a different role for for the devops

808
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,840
champion the dev of champion is

809
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,679
basically the guy who uh checks the

810
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,760
results of the automated

811
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,399
dependency checking tools okay

812
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,720
so you should definitely do automated

813
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
dependency checking because if you don't

814
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,480
you will certainly

815
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,640
produce vulnerable software but the

816
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,880
thing is that even if you do these

817
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,880
automated checkings you need somebody

818
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,360
who interprets the results of these uh

819
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,200
checkings and that's not a trivial thing

820
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,679
you need someone who really understands

821
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,679
how to interpret it and what to what to

822
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,000
do what to intervene that's the most

823
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,320
important uh role of the of the devops

824
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,480
champion but also you know he

825
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,360
he or she has some related tasks like

826
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,799
like where to store secrets how to how

827
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,360
to handle them well how not to store

828
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,120
secrets in the

829
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,600
revision control system and so on and so

830
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,039
on and finally the the fourth role is uh

831
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,399
the test champion who is responsible for

832
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,960
uh security during the testing which

833
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,600
means that i believe that software's

834
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
should be tested from a security point

835
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,279
of view during the testing it doesn't

836
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,760
really mean penetration testing it means

837
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,279
just a normal

838
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,000
um you know

839
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,519
sober uh common sense testing like okay

840
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,120
this

841
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,039
url should not be

842
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:27,919
uh

843
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,720
reachable without an authentication is

844
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
it unreachable without any

845
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,200
authentication it's not really it's not

846
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,279
difficult a normal normal tester can

847
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,000
test it okay but most of the times

848
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,360
testers don't

849
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,200
don't do such tests it is the

850
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,120
penetration testers who do such tests

851
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,519
and then realize that oops this is where

852
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,159
i can be actually accessed without

853
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,399
without any authentication or without

854
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,000
the right authorization but this is

855
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,080
something that could be and should be

856
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,440
should be done

857
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,039
during the test uh

858
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,799
during the normal

859
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,200
functionality test

860
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
of the application okay and these are

861
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
four different roles which doesn't mean

862
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,918
that they have to be different persons

863
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,320
it is possible that one person has two

864
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,280
three or four roles

865
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,320
but most of the time especially in a big

866
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,399
company i believe it's better if these

867
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,159
are diff different persons and of course

868
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,079
you have you don't have just one

869
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,760
reviewer champion and one design

870
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,679
champion with you you have many probably

871
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,480
one in every project or

872
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,639
yeah probably that's the

873
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,280
there's the best way yeah and we forgot

874
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,760
to mention that uh we are talking about

875
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,159
uh implement implementing uh things

876
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,879
within a team within the project because

877
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,800
teams and project they have this special

878
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,280
tooling they maybe use different

879
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,040
language from the other

880
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,079
project maybe a different framework so

881
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,240
there are specific

882
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,079
things about

883
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,240
the implementation of the organizational

884
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,160
glue into the team and and other glues

885
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,800
like on the and the whole uh

886
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,760
organization uh or software development

887
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,839
department probably is the organization

888
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,760
that we call organization here um level

889
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,359
uh so probably for uh today it's enough

890
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,640
uh uh

891
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,680
of introduction introducing uh uh the

892
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,560
concept and the program and of course

893
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,040
there are more details so it was only

894
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,839
just

895
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,560
scratching the surface yes because uh

896
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,040
the devil in the in the detail so we

897
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,160
