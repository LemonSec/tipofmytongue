1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,839
arcsan is now digital.ai

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,759
join us at our booth in the virtual expo

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,080
hall to learn how our app protection

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,080
white box cryptography and threat

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,080
analytics solutions can help you stay

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,320
ahead of the evolving threat landscape

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,359
uh hi hello everyone thanks for having

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,080
me here so my name is random liu from

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,320
pinterest it's really exciting to have

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,119
this opportunity to share our research

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,479
from pinterest

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,480
so today i'm going to talk about

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,360
detecting socialmedia.net with linkage

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,640
analysis and machine learning

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,559
so before we get started let me give

16
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,719
some introduction about myself

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,879
so my name is rendung i'm a senior

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,039
machine learning engineer in trust and

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,960
city team at pinterest

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,879
so trust and safety team is like the

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,760
integrity team and our responsibility is

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,199
to detect abusive users unsafe content

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,559
basically to make pinterest safer

24
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,959
and here i have been leading the effort

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,799
building machine learning solutions for

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,080
spam and anti-abuse

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,720
before this i worked at shape security

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,960
as a research scientist where my

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,200
research was mainly around detecting

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,360
automated web attacks

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,240
my first job was at fireeye focusing on

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,640
malware analysis and email security

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,040
so in my daily life i enjoy surfing at

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
pacifica and santa cruz i also have a

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,720
cat called andy

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,600
okay so that's all about me let's get

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,839
into getting started with the topic

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,640
so the outline of today's talk

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,640
contains three parts

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,799
first we'll give an introduction about

41
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,119
social media spam we'll talk about what

42
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,439
is social media spam and particularly

43
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,399
talk about the spam botnet problem which

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,759
is a major threat for social platforms

45
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,960
and second we'll try to build a botnet

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,719
detection solution

47
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,040
we borrow a concept from crime

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,679
investigation which is the case linkage

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,520
analysis

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
from there we'll try to build two

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,319
machine learning models the first one is

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,800
an unsupervised behavior clustering

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,720
model and the second is a

54
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,879
semi-supervised model based on label

55
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,480
propagation

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,200
and the last part is around spam defense

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,319
automation

58
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,760
we'll talk about how to build the

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,519
machine learning pipeline based on the

60
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,160
models we have introduced and also show

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,720
some example applications in our spam

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,360
detection platforms

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,440
so without further ado let's

64
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,920
dig in

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,680
the first part is about introduction

66
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,640
so with the rise of social media social

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,800
network has been affecting our lives

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,720
much more than before

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,560
the recent analysis shows that in 2005

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,879
there are only like five percent of u.s

71
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,319
adults had access to social platforms

72
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,879
but now in 2019

73
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,159
more than 79 of us are using it every

74
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,280
day

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,440
and the average time we spend on social

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,440
platforms is also rising year by year

77
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,440
and in 2019 the most recent research

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,519
shows that

79
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,760
modern adults usually spend two and a

80
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,239
half hours on social platforms every day

81
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,440
so

82
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,159
social media has become a very good

83
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,200
target

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,159
for

85
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,400
make profit online and also attracts a

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,000
lot of spammers and hackers

87
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,480
so there are various ways spammers can

88
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,440
make profit from social media platform

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,640
they'll distribute malware gambling and

90
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,920
porn sites

91
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,319
they also share excessive ads or

92
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,560
affiliate links and utilizing the

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,640
pay-per-view or pay-per-click model to

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,159
make money

95
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,920
we have also seen spammers try to

96
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,640
promote their e-commerce scam sites

97
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,360
when users actually make a purchase on

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
the site they never get the product

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,959
delivered

100
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,238
spammers also sell fake accounts folders

101
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,918
or likes to satisfy people's ego

102
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,479
we can see that most spams are all

103
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,800
around user clicks

104
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,280
more traffic means more money

105
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,040
we have also observed the different

106
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,840
types of spammy behavior spammers will

107
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,400
intentionally spread malicious links to

108
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
get malware installation

109
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,240
they also share excessive clickbait

110
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,600
content to trick for user visiting

111
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,000
bug messaging unfolding is also a

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,479
strategy for spam since there are always

113
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,800
some users who are so curious that they

114
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,360
cannot control themselves from clicking

115
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,199
the links a stranger provides

116
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,120
some smart spammers leverage fake

117
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,680
engagement to gamble the ranking systems

118
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
so their content could run higher in

119
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,720
home fees and get more distribution

120
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,680
a

121
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
successful spam campaign usually

122
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
involves two important factors

123
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,639
the need to attack a scale and attack

124
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,800
with automation

125
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,120
of course the manual fraud is far from

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,280
fulfilling the need for excessive

127
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,679
content distribution

128
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,639
the next part i will talk about some

129
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,120
statistics that are specific to spam on

130
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,639
pinterest

131
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,120
if you have ever used the pinterest app

132
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,039
you should be familiar with pinterest

133
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,479
product design

134
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,440
so we allow users to upload an image or

135
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,680
video to create a pin

136
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,160
and then with the pin users can also

137
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
attach a link

138
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,720
when we see the pin and get interested

139
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
we could click through the pin and reach

140
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
the landing page and find more

141
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,320
interesting stuff

142
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,479
so this design is to provide a more

143
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,720
convenient way for users to share

144
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,919
inspirations and find out what they love

145
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,240
but also this model gives spammers a

146
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,600
proxy for link spamming

147
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,080
the most common types of spam we are

148
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,520
observing are from mystery misdirected

149
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,479
pins

150
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,639
which means spammers will copy and paste

151
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,520
the legitimate user's content and change

152
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,840
the landing page to a spammy link then

153
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,400
redistribute it

154
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,759
a lot of link spamming is around ads and

155
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,120
affiliate links or malware links

156
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
on the right side you can see the alert

157
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,919
box we usually show to users when we

158
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,039
detect a spam domain or link

159
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,919
underneath the pin

160
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,039
ever since pinterest has launched we

161
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,120
have already detected like more than

162
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,400
half a billion

163
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,800
accounts because of spam

164
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,440
that's about like 30 of all accounts

165
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,039
ever registered

166
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,199
and the number is even more than our

167
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,479
monthly active users

168
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,800
so during our long-term fighting against

169
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,039
them we found that most of the spam

170
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,318
accounts are from bots

171
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,599
so spam botnet is a major threat for

172
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,720
social media but it is nothing new

173
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,280
if we quickly do some online search we

174
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,680
can easily find some a commercial

175
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,800
software for social bonnet on the market

176
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,120
well they provide lots of convenience to

177
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,880
control bot accounts

178
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,680
to

179
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,560
do the social marketing or just for spam

180
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,960
purposes

181
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,400
when we actually check their

182
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,880
advertisement you can see they provide

183
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,080
like a lot of features like real browser

184
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,199
simulation so you can avoid front-end

185
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,440
detection and they also provide like

186
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,599
pattern of cascading features

187
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,440
like random delay

188
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,280
and these softwares also provide like

189
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,080
proxy support so if your ip gets blocked

190
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,479
you can easily mutate and most

191
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,280
importantly they allow users to control

192
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,120
like multiple accounts

193
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,039
you can actually import

194
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,599
a lot of bot accounts just using a text

195
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,240
file with username and password in each

196
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,240
line

197
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,240
another usage of spam.net is the spam as

198
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
a service

199
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,440
so instead of purchasing all the

200
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,240
infrastructure to launch a spam campaign

201
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,560
on your own you can just spend some

202
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,360
money to buy some spam services

203
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,120
and the spam service on the marquee

204
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,919
usually accepts your content or your

205
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,080
your link and they will do the heavy

206
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,519
lifting for you

207
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,599
and you just wait at home and they will

208
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,479
generate visitor clicks for your spam

209
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,800
sites

210
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,600
as we can see spam.net has so many

211
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,640
advanced features

212
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,160
they

213
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,720
their behavior are randomized and it is

214
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,399
fully automated

215
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,480
and they leverage a lot of accounts and

216
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,000
ip to bypass the real limit

217
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,800
and they can also be very tolerant which

218
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,279
means they can quickly refill accounts

219
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,000
or ip addresses once some of them are

220
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
blocked

221
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,560
this creates a lot of challenges for our

222
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
detection

223
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,800
sometimes we observe that each spam

224
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,720
account may only have

225
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,279
several actions in their lifetime

226
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,519
so the events log is not sufficient

227
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,920
enough for a high confidence detection

228
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,760
and since most of the traditional

229
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,000
rule-based defense method mostly look at

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,720
spam accounts individually it can be

231
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
difficult to correlate different

232
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,440
accounts within the same campaign and

233
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,600
see the true volume of the spam attack

234
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,120
so in order to detect this

235
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,920
we let's jump into part two to build a

236
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,160
spam bond and detection solution

237
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,720
we will first try to borrow a concept

238
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,680
from

239
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,440
crime investigation

240
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,399
which is called case linkage analysis

241
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,800
it is also referred to as linkage

242
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,920
analysis is the process of determining

243
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,160
whether there are discrete connections

244
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,720
or distinctive behavioral factors that

245
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,360
associate unrelated cases by means of

246
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,440
crime scene analysis

247
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,279
it is also referred to as linkage

248
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,160
analysis is the process of determining

249
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,320
whether there are discrete connections

250
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,880
or distinctive behavior factors that

251
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,279
associate unrelated cases by means of

252
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,200
crime scene analysis

253
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
the idea is to identify crime

254
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,800
committed by the same offender

255
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
i'm sure that most of us have seen crime

256
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,680
investigation movies or documentaries

257
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,000
when detectives analyze multiple crime

258
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,040
scenes

259
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,959
when they find too much evidence

260
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,000
similarity in different crime cases they

261
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,920
may reach to the conclusion that those

262
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,640
cases are committed by the same

263
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,760
serial offender or serial killer

264
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,519
and during investigation they will

265
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,440
collect evidence like

266
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,880
dna or fingerprint shoe print common

267
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,440
usage of a weapon or common

268
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,880
famous location

269
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,600
so they are very good at evidences that

270
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
can correlate different crime scenes and

271
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
help investigation

272
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,760
and similarly we can adopt this

273
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,240
methodology for botnet detection since

274
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,120
naturally crime cyber crime is also a

275
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,240
type of crime the idea is to associate

276
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
butt accounts with their behavior

277
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,399
evidence and discover accounts

278
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,600
controlled by the same spammer

279
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,519
so there are clearly some advantages

280
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,640
from this method we are able to identify

281
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,360
board accounting groups we can

282
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,680
take actions in boxes we are detecting

283
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,760
them in bulk

284
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,000
we can actually capture the whole

285
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,560
campaign by aggregating all the spam

286
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,839
accounts and their behavior

287
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,440
so the key point of performing linkage

288
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,839
linkage analysis is to build the bot

289
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,880
linkage

290
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,279
the bot linkage can be defined as

291
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,120
behavior similarity

292
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,440
so it's basically try to find

293
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,519
properties that commonly shared by butt

294
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,440
accounts but rarely

295
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,079
shared by logic users

296
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,760
let's say if account allison account bob

297
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,240
if addis and bulbs share some behavior

298
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,480
similarity x y and z

299
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
then we believe based on intuition that

300
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,959
the likelihood of them being controlled

301
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,160
by the same spammer is very high then we

302
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,680
add a bot linkage between them

303
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,560
so there are a lot of ways to define

304
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,160
their behavior properties we can include

305
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,560
like network properties like ip address

306
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,079
or user agent

307
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,000
we can also leverage like profile

308
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,800
related features like email user

309
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,839
description profile pictures we can also

310
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,639
involve like engagement related features

311
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,480
like if two accounts have posted the

312
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,079
same content comment if they have liked

313
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,800
the same stuff

314
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,040
here i'll give an example of the

315
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,360
bot linkage and try to analyze the

316
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,680
properties two users can share and the

317
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,560
likelihood of them being connected let's

318
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
say alice and bob

319
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,399
they're both active on pinterest on the

320
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,440
same day

321
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,040
so the likelihood of them being

322
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,600
connected is really low here because

323
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,519
there are a lot of users using pinterest

324
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,200
each day

325
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,560
and what if they also liked the same pin

326
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,440
well this is also low because

327
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,839
for some viral pins a lot of users could

328
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,880
like it

329
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,079
too

330
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,160
so what if they also log in from the

331
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,279
same app address well intuitively this

332
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,199
makes the likelihood of them being

333
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,079
connected kind of higher but there are

334
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,440
still some edge cases like public wi-fi

335
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,240
address where users could share the same

336
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,480
login ip

337
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,720
and then move forward what if they have

338
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,600
also uploaded the same image with the

339
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,760
same hash

340
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,240
will intuitively will believe that

341
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,839
this will make them

342
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,480
their connection probability higher

343
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,160
because this really happened on

344
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,760
legitimate users

345
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,720
and lastly what if they also post with

346
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,320
the same text

347
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,240
like follow us today click the link

348
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,600
below

349
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,880
will base or based on our experience

350
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,600
this kind of common behavior rarely

351
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,320
shared between the german users and at

352
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,680
this point we believe that the

353
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,920
likelihood of anise and bubba connected

354
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,399
are very high

355
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,639
so it is worth noting that

356
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,639
different linkage definition could

357
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,959
result in different types of spam

358
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,000
behavior detection

359
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,519
so from there let's try to build a

360
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,560
unsupervised learning model so the first

361
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,440
step is to build the linkage network

362
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,959
the idea is

363
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,079
connecting to accounts if they have a

364
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,760
bot linkage between

365
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,199
and first we will collect all the

366
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,600
accounts and we should try to connect

367
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,360
every two accounts if they have a both

368
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,279
linkage

369
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,680
then we will have a account connection

370
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,560
graph

371
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,160
with each account as a node and

372
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,519
shared bot linkage as edges

373
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,800
with the graph we can start to perform

374
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,519
like graph based clustering and after

375
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,560
community community detection will find

376
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,440
there a lot of there are different

377
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,639
clusters of accounts and a lot we'll

378
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,360
also find that a lot of legitimate users

379
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,759
will remain as dangling points in the

380
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,000
graph which means they are not connected

381
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,480
with each other since legitimate users

382
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
rarely share the bot linkage with other

383
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,480
users

384
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,759
and from there we'll look at the large

385
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,240
clusters and try to label the botnet

386
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,079
accounts

387
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,399
if our bot linkage definition is strong

388
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,519
enough it is most likely that the larger

389
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,759
the cluster the more spammy it could be

390
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,440
uh here we're using behavior based graph

391
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,240
learning so the advantage of it is we

392
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,959
have better visualization because it's

393
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,880
graphed naturally we can visualize it

394
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,600
just by plotting the edges

395
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,680
and nodes

396
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,399
and from behavior based method it is

397
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,959
completely content agnostic which means

398
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,759
we don't really care about what use what

399
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,560
users are posting we can correlate just

400
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,839
by their behavior similarity

401
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,839
and this method is highly debuggable

402
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,000
which means if you find some false

403
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,800
positive cases you can quickly dig into

404
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,279
the graph and find out what is causing

405
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,360
the false property and fine-tuning your

406
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,560
model

407
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,959
and this method does not require any

408
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,600
labels at all

409
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,160
but in reality during our long term

410
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,000
buying fighting we do collect a lot of

411
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,559
labels so how can we utilize those

412
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,119
labels efficiently as well

413
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,720
so next part i will introduce a

414
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,119
semi-supervised

415
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,119
model

416
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,799
and before that

417
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,319
let's take

418
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,039
uh sorry

419
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,000
okay let's cancel over

420
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,600
uh before moving forward let's take a

421
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,240
look about another crime investigation

422
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,520
strategy

423
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,400
so when we watch mafia related movies or

424
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,520
news we often notice that during a mafia

425
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,080
takedown operation the fbi or the

426
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,160
government normally don't arrest

427
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,799
non-important suspects even though they

428
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,160
have collected strong evidence that

429
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,000
they are criminal and they can make a

430
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,120
charge

431
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,600
but instead they start to monitor those

432
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,840
suspects behavior and helped for the

433
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,000
boss or more members

434
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and they hope to find out the clear

435
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,320
mafia structure so that they can take it

436
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,640
down altogether

437
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,039
we'll look for evidences like

438
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,720
social connections

439
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,160
uh transactions made or their common

440
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,080
home locations

441
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,039
and similarly in social spam detection

442
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,000
we could also take the similar steps but

443
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,960
with a different concept shadow band

444
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,720
so what is shadowbank

445
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,280
shadowbank means when we identify some

446
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,640
bad actors

447
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,200
instead of deactivating them immediately

448
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,039
we silence them

449
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,679
so when we shadow banner account the

450
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,080
camp is still alive for posting you can

451
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,480
still engage with the account by posting

452
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,320
stuff like stuff

453
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,799
but the content generated by this

454
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,960
account is no longer available for

455
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,840
discovery services which means home feed

456
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,760
will not pick up the content from this

457
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
account and this will have very minimal

458
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,720
impact for other users and the content

459
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,400
will not get distributed

460
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
so the advantage of shadow band is just

461
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,120
like the what we introduced during a

462
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,160
mafia takedown operation we can monitor

463
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,760
silenced accounts

464
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,840
and track other accounts with similar

465
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,640
activities and this will help us detect

466
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,840
more spam accounts

467
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,200
here we'll try to leverage the account

468
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,600
connection graph we have previously

469
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,520
and also utilizing the shadow band

470
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,720
accounts

471
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,120
we first build the linkage graph and

472
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,400
from there we'll mark the shadow band

473
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
accounts that were previously identified

474
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,320
as bad

475
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,679
and using some

476
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,000
predefined rules we can start to

477
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,679
propagate the label

478
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,760
just to mark the

479
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,919
accounts connected with the shadow band

480
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,240
accounts as bad

481
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,200
we can then try to iterate this approach

482
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,559
until the graph converge

483
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,280
and from here we gather more positive

484
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,640
spam accounts just from the limited

485
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,720
shadow band accounts from the previous

486
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,960
graph

487
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,360
and of course this method may involve

488
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,720
some risks

489
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,840
the first one is the cascade effect

490
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,480
which means one single false positive

491
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,919
may cost more

492
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,280
let's say we mislabeled one account

493
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,480
as a shadow band account just by mistake

494
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,240
and somehow this account is connected

495
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,080
with some other users

496
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,159
just by label propagation we could

497
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,919
potentially introduce

498
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,280
more false positives because

499
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,919
just the bot linkage they have around

500
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,559
the shadow band accounts and the second

501
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,360
one is adversarial spoilers

502
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,559
if spammers figure out this algorithm

503
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,880
they can intentionally

504
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,799
try to ruin or detect a method

505
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,360
some spammers intentionally try to copy

506
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,080
paste the content from good users

507
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,200
and if we just use the bot linkage

508
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,360
if we just define bot linkage by

509
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,000
behaviors similarity

510
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,640
this could result some good users

511
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,840
being

512
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,080
marked as bad because of the propagating

513
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,440
labels

514
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,280
so there are some possible solutions

515
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,039
from here

516
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,520
first we can limit the propagation

517
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,039
iteration steps

518
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,799
and restrict the

519
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,799
false positive from

520
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,440
being distributed too much

521
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,159
and second we can also define a more

522
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,640
robust about linkage definition by

523
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,320
introducing some non-verbal properties

524
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,480
for example a spammer may intentionally

525
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,880
copy content from good users

526
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,520
but it is very hard for them to

527
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,880
like reuse the same user agent or ip

528
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,960
address from the good users

529
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,360
so by introducing those non-folder

530
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,039
properties with defining your blood

531
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,280
linkage we can limit

532
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
the chance for

533
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,679
we can limit the chance of propagating

534
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,919
wrong labels

535
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,480
so the third part we will talk about how

536
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
to build a

537
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,159
span defense automation

538
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,440
so this slice shows the pipeline we have

539
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,480
to for the machine learning models

540
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,000
it contains three stages

541
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,720
so the first we need to collect the

542
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,159
features and

543
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,640
by processing the logs we'll dump the

544
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,080
event log from user frontend into a

545
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,000
relational database

546
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,799
basically it's a column-based

547
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,039
database with different features

548
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,280
we also try to build behavior profiles

549
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,200
for each account

550
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,280
after we have all profiles for all

551
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,520
accounts we can start to build the bot

552
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,600
linkage

553
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,440
we will cross drawing

554
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,159
account profiles and account every two

555
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,679
accounts if the

556
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,159
link between them satisfies a linkage

557
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,440
definition

558
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,000
and after that we will have a connection

559
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,280
graph in etch listed format

560
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
once we have the graph we can perform

561
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
graph learning algorithms

562
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,000
we will perform graph-based clustering

563
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,240
and after community detection we will

564
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,600
have different

565
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,320
clusters of accounts

566
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,280
so after this stage we will have each

567
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,960
account

568
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,799
assigned with a

569
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,840
unique cluster id

570
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,320
so from there we can start to take a

571
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,120
look at the large clusters and maybe

572
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
take some action

573
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,559
we'll mostly most likely classify

574
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,200
bot clusters by looking at the cluster

575
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,720
size and deactivates the old accounts

576
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,880
within the large clusters

577
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,240
and agents

578
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,600
and analysts will keep monitoring this

579
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,919
cluster results and try to see if

580
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,240
there's any incident response needed

581
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,120
and the whole pipeline we leveraged

582
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,840
several open source libraries like kafka

583
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,640
and spark and for graph based learning

584
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,720
algorithms we use the graphics

585
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,360
so i will introduce some example

586
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,520
applications we have in pinterest

587
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,760
platform for spam detection

588
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
so the first one is the fake account

589
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,880
spam detection the heuristic is simple

590
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,960
we have observed a lot of

591
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,559
spammers trying to

592
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,559
book register fake accounts and they

593
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,400
either resell it or launch the

594
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,960
bot spam campaign on their own and

595
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,360
normally they will register in the same

596
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,760
time period with similar

597
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,600
profiles

598
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,159
so here we will define the bot linkage

599
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,360
as similar signup time and similar

600
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,840
profiles

601
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,159
we'll first

602
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,640
gather all the cons registered in the

603
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,200
similar time period and perform a

604
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,120
locality sensitive hash

605
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,320
and map

606
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,720
each account into a different bucket

607
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
and after that we will connect every two

608
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,600
accounts in the same bucket and get the

609
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,880
connection graph

610
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,559
then we repeat the process we have

611
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,240
introduced and get large clusters

612
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,200
with similar profiles

613
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,960
from there we'll look at the large

614
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,600
clusters and most likely they are from

615
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,559
bots

616
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,360
registrations

617
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,600
so here is a detection example of this

618
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,679
machine learning model

619
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,080
i have shown here what i have shown here

620
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,600
is a cluster of point related accounts

621
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,919
as you can see they have very similar

622
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,440
profile description

623
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,679
we have also observed that spammers are

624
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,000
intentionally mutating their text

625
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,080
description to a white rule-based

626
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,639
detection

627
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,000
so next i will introduce the ping

628
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,720
create.net spam detection

629
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,120
model we have the heuristic is

630
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,440
legitimate users are pretty

631
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,559
random and unique they really

632
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,000
have similar

633
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,880
behavior like posting the same content

634
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,320
multiple times

635
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
and normally those behaviors usually

636
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,720
belong to like protocols

637
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,159
and here we'll define bot linkage as

638
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,120
two accounts have similar active time

639
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,760
and they also post the identical image

640
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,279
or text multiple times

641
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,720
and from the model itself

642
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,200
we detect a lot of

643
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
pin create botnets

644
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
and here i will show this the one

645
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,440
example we have here

646
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,120
on the right you can see the connection

647
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,080
graph

648
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,600
it contains

649
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,760
54k nodes as

650
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,880
accounts

651
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,679
and

652
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,840
900

653
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,720
pages as two users have posted similar

654
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,200
content multiple times

655
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,120
it is worth noticing that

656
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,919
all the jimmy users most admin users are

657
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,480
dangling in the graph so i have removed

658
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,159
them

659
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,480
and we may take a deep look into that we

660
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,120
found that it actually includes several

661
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,000
malware campaigns that were active last

662
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,279
year

663
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,760
so this helped us to detect

664
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,840
a

665
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,679
several campaigns without even digging

666
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,399
into what content they are they're using

667
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,159
and our analysts

668
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,480
also analyzed the results and quickly

669
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,399
patched a rule to stop the campaign

670
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,960
okay i think that's all i have today so

671
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,919
i have several key takeaways

672
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,320
so in this talk we adopted several crime

673
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,640
investigation strategy for cyber

674
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,080
security defense

675
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,880
so this is intuitive because cyber crime

676
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,200
is a crime as well so the methodology

677
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,919
will work here as well

678
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,600
and we also leverage the behavior

679
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,399
analysis to build linkage graph and use

680
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,960
graph learning for spam detection

681
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,440
so this method is behavior-based and

682
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,960
content agnostic

683
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,919
this enables us to find

684
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,640
identify new attacks pattern quickly in

685
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,919
the wild

686
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,559
and the same method would also apply to

687
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,960
