i'm the leader the creator of the

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,640
software security program

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,799
and the security community

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,560
in our cloud protection business line

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,640
which provide products

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
and cloud services

40
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,400
for identity

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,640
and access management

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
data protection

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,680
and the key management

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,920
with such business

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,520
and in fact in all other businesses

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,280
logging is an important and unnecessary

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,840
activity

48
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,079
to most people

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,479
logging is about cutting trees into lots

50
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,799
as we see lots in this picture

51
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,360
logging also

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,599
means to keep a record

53
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,440
of events in chronicle

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,959
the results

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,840
which

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
which may be in books

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,440
files

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,200
or databases are also called logs

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,480
as you know

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,360
this is what we're going to talk about

61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,400
fabrication logging

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
not only we review and monitor our logs

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,840
but also customers who use our products

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,920
do it too

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,239
it is not uncommon

66
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,400
that a customer notices

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,519
some abnormal things in logs

68
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,480
and send us inquiries

69
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,000
in such cases

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
i'm always impressed

71
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,440
while

72
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,079
someone actually review the logs

73
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,640
many systems

74
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,800
such as applications

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,239
web servers

76
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,840
databases

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
firewalls

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,040
load balancers

79
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,080
lock their activity for a variety of

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,840
purposes

81
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,400
log data provides information about when

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,519
where

83
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,040
what has happened

84
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,480
for what reason

85
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,720
and who has done what

86
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,000
when and where

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,799
are different kinds of logs for example

88
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,239
system logs

89
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,519
audit logs arrow logs

90
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,120
security logs

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,640
etc

92
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,200
log data are invaluable

93
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,280
for intrusion detection

94
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,640
monitoring

95
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,080

97
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,840
audit trails and so on

98
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,280
since logs often record who

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,159
logs may contain personal data

100
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,959
as such privacy laws apply here

101
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
owasp

102
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,000
has provided various tools and guidance

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,160
related to logging

104
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,079

developers and operations

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,680
use these tools

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,400
to enhance the performance

117
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,880
and the security posture of their

118
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,840
products and

119
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,040
services then

120
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,360
why are we still talking about logging

121
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,320
on the one hand

122
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,720
different businesses can have different

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,000
sets of security requirements

124
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,639
based on the risks they face

125
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,960

126
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,560

the business

130
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,639
is often needed for developers and

131
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,440
operations

all used by eu persons

144
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,919
developers often raise questions

145
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,680
regarding

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,560
to what data can be can or cannot be

147
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,960
logged to keep gdpr compliance

148
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,120

and services

158
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,440
based on the business need

159
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,240
and by following industry best practices

160
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,639
since people have asked

161
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,520
questions regarding to gdpr

162
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,360
we have consulted

163
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,000
with our privacy lawyers

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,960
to get answers

165
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,680
in this talk

166
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,919
we are going to share what we have

167
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,520
learned

168
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,120
and our best practices

169
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,680
regarding to logging and the gdpr

170
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,560
security logging is about

171
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,840
what to log for security purposes

172
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,440
for forensics

173
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,520
and audits

174
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,840
security of the logging

175
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,360
is about log stream protection

176
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,280
logging regardless for security or not

177
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,319
needs to consider privacy because locked

178
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,520
data may contain personal data which may

179
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,280
subject to privacy laws

180
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,919
last year i attended a threat modeling

181
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,960
workshop

182
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,400
at owasp

183
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,199
alaska which is an annual security

184
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,479
conference

185
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,280
held in austin texas

186
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,720
the first part

187
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
of the workshop

188
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,039
is to imagine a product

189
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,520
and builds its

190
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,840
flow diagram

191
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,759
after some brainstorming the attendees

192
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,120
decided

193
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,039
on an imaginary smart scooter

194
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,120
what can they do

195
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
one person said

196
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,360
collect anything that we can we can from

197
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,639
the rider

198
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
this may include the face

199
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,199
the heartbeat

200
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,599
the palm print the location and so on

201
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,640
i asked

202
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,039
why

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,039
oh we collect as much as possible for

204
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,200
future use

205
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,880
another person said just log everything

206
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,640
i asked again why

207
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,680
i can't get answer

208
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,519
should you do that

209
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,320
just because you can

210
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,640
for what purpose

211
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,360
what are risks of keeping this data

212
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,880
many countries

213
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,360
have data privacy laws

214
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,760
these laws are designed

215
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,600
to protect personal

216
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,800
data

217
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,120
stored on computers

218
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,480
or organize the paper filing system

219
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,760
in transit

220
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,920
and in use

221
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
they define rules

222
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,360
that people

223
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,360
employees and organizations must follow

224
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,640
when dealing with personal data rules

225
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,160
are enforced

226
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,920
by a government agency

227
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,920
data privacy laws

228
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,519
do not prevent

229
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,880
organizations from storing and using

230
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,959
personal data

231
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,199
they just must follow the rules

232
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,240
european union's general data protection

233
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,720
regulation gdpr

234
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
is a law for protecting personal data

235
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,240
the law states

236
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,279
the protection of natural persons

237
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,760
in relation to the processing of

238
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,200
personal data

239
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,399
is a fundamental right

240
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,200
everyone has the right

241
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
to the protection

242
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,839
of personal data concerning him

243
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,680
or hers

244
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,720
this is not an absolute right though

245
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,399
it must be considered

246
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,320
in relation to its function in society

247
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
and be violence against other

248
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,279
fundamental rights

249
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,839
gdpr is enforceable

250
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,920
since may 25th 2018

251
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,760
fines can go up

252
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
to four percent

253
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
of the organization's revenue or 20

254
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,399
million euros whichever is higher

255
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,760
it is the most astringent law

256
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,279
among 110 data privacy laws in the world

257
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,079
gdpr is a long legal document

258
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,920
we are not going to talk about all

259
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,440
aspects of it

260
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
but will highlight

261
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,880
important concepts

262
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,480
that are relevant

263
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,040
to application logging

264
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,399
so

265
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,680
what is personal data

266
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,760
according to gdpr

267
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,200
personal data is any information

268
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,200
relating to a natural person directly or

269
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,120
indirectly

270
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,720
for example

271
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,640
name

272
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,279
phone number location

273
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,640
id number ip address

274
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,360
a racial or ethnic origin

275
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,880
health information and so on

276
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,160
as you can see it is not limited to

277
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,519
traditional identifier such as names and

278
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,000
address

279
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,079
since applications log user activities

280
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,920
logs often include personal data

281
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,639
our developers ask

282
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,519
what personal data we should not log

283
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,800
what personal data we can log

284
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,079
we need to answer these questions

285
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,079
to ensure gdpr compliance

286
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,360
logging involves data recording

287
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,480
storage and the transmission

288
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,760
all these fall into the concept of data

289
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,839
processing

290
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,480
considering logging may include personal

291
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,440
data

292
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,639
it needs to follow gdpr's

293
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,399
principle of personal data processing

294
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,000
gdpr article 5

295
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,800
lists the six principles

296
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,560
relating to processing of personal data

297
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,119
here is a summary

298
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,920
personal data

299
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,839
should be processed

300
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,279
lawfully

301
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,800
fairly and in a transparent manner in

302
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,720
relation to the data subject

303
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,680
personal data should be collected

304
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,440
for specified

305
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,360
explicit and legitimate purposes

306
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,600
and not further processed

307
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,560
in a manner that is incompatible with

308
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,839
those purposes

309
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,240
it should be adequate

310
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,519
relevant

311
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,880
and limited

312
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,959
to what is necessary

313
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,399
to the purpose

314
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,920
for which there is

315
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,600
they are processed

316
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,560
this is also called data minimization

317
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,040
personal data should be

318
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,800
accurate

319
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,880
and where necessary kept up to date

320
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,199
personal data should be retained

321
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,000
only for as long as necessary

322
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,760
it should be processed

323
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,040
in a manner

324
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,920
that

325
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,040
ensures

326
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,079
appropriate security including

327
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,279
protection

328
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,480
against

329
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,920
unauthorized

330
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,720
or unlawful processing against

331
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,959
accidental loss

332
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,599
instruction

333
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,519
so protecting personal data

334
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,160
is part of the

335
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,199
data processing principle

336
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,800
let's look at these

337
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,399
items in more details especially those

338
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,800
closely related

339
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,680
to application logging

340
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,240
as we said earlier

341
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,720
processing should be lawful must be

342
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,000
lawful

343
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,800
gdpr article 6 says

344
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,240
processing should be lawful

345
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,440
only if at least

346
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,959
one of the conditions applies

347
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,199
there are a couple of conditions

348
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,040
among them

349
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,519
the processing is necessary for the

350
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,639
purpose

351
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,759
of the

352
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,240
legitimate interests

353
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,440
pursued by the data controller or by a

354
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,959
third party

355
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,240
for example for providing service or

356
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,360
support to users

357
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,959
the gdpr recital 49 also says

358
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,920
the processing of personal data to the

359
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,399
extent

360
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,560
to the extent

361
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,600
strictly necessary and proportionate for

362
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,199
the purpose

363
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,800
of ensuring

364
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,600
network and information security

365
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,360
constitute a legitimate interest

366
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,199
of data controller

367
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,680
concerned

368
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,880
so it is possible to process personal

369
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,480
data in our case

370
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,720
logging personal data

371
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,160
while in compliance with gdpr

372
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,839
we need to make sure

373
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,040
to follow

374
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,000
other principles

375
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,399
personal data collected

376
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,120
must be for specified

377
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,560
explicit and legitimate purposes

378
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
in other words

379
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,279
you must have a justification of need

380
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,519
what is it

381
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,720
data control data collected should be

382
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,000
necessary

383
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,480
to accomplish the purpose

384
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,040
for which the log data are generated by

385
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
the i.t system

386
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,839
for example

387
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,839
for providing

388
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,039
support

389
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,480
maintenance

390
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,360
and security

391
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,199
personal data in logs

392
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,559
should be adequate relevant and limited

393
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,280
to what is necessary in relation to the

394
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,359
purpose of logging

395
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,839
you want to minimize the

396
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,000
personal data in your log

397
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,799
do not log more than

398
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,799
you need you cannot justify your need by

399
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,320
unknown potential future purposes

400
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,919
as i mentioned

401
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,880
earlier about my previous experience

402
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,240
otherwise you're not compliant to gdpr

403
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,760
now

404
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,559
what should not be long

405
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,919
sensitive

406
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,400
in gdpr terms

407
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,960
called special categories of personal

408
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,240
data should not be loved

409
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
these are examples

410
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,600
racial

411
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,840
or ethnic origin

412
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,400
political opinions or trade union

413
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,840
membership

414
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,679
religious or philosophical beliefs

415
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,919
information about health

416
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,840
or sex life

417
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,960
information related to crime

418
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,000
genetic data biometric data social

419
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,240
security number copy of an id document

420
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,679
these should not be logged you must have

421
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,400
really really good reasons to include

422
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,720
such data in a log

423
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,600
for example for public safety or for

424
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,840
saving lives

425
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,120
in addition explicit consent could be

426
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,760
required

427
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,480
what can be logged

428
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,440
logs may include personal data exact

429
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,400
sensitive data we mentioned earlier as

430
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,600
long as

431
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,039
the need can be justified

432
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,000
the data collected must be necessary to

433
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,880
accomplish the purpose for which the

434
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,120
logs are generated by the system

435
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,600
personal data should be retained

436
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,880
only as long as necessary

437
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,840
in order to do this

438
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,360
define a log retention policy

439
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,760
personal data in logs

440
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,799
may be retained for the duration of the

441
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,440
agreement with the customer

442
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,360
it may go beyond

443
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,440
expiration of the agreement

444
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,919
for example for compliance

445
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,679
reasons

446
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,960
the duration of the retention period

447
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,919
should be driven by the usefulness of

448
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,799
the log data

449
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,720
eliminate personal data at the end of

450
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,000
the retention period

451
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,559
remove personal data or logs if they're

452
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,360
no longer needed

453
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,200
so

454
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,919
they should only be returned

455
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,400
retained as long as necessary

456
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,840
let's summarize

457
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,120
what we have so far

458
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,679
including personal data in logs

459
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,720
must be gener must be justified

460
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,400
do not lock them

461
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,480
unless it is necessary

462
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,880
for your service or for security

463
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,039
be compliant with the principles

464
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,480
of personal data processing

465
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,880
last but not least

466
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,600
protect personal data in logs

467
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,280
improper protection may result in data

468
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,559
disclosure

469
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,640
which can be misused

470
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,840
for example for identity fraud

471
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,280
black mailing

472
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,200
targeted marketing

473
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,080
this can cause personal suffering and

474
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,280
financial damage to individuals

475
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,960
as well as financial harm legal trouble

476
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,679
and reputation damage to service

477
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,960
providers

478
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,120
and organizations

479
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,280
such as lost revenue

480
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,039
loss of customers loss of time lawsuit

481
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,840
and the penalties

482
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,960
the personal data protection is required

483
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,320
by laws

484
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,520
of different

485
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,720
nations

486
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,640
for this reason

487
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,240
protect personal data in logs

488
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,080
for long data protection we need to

489
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,159
ensure

490
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:50,720
confidentiality

491
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,360
integrity

492
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,840
and authenticity

493
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,080
security requirements

494
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,360
of protection may depend on the type of

495
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,960
personal data

496
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,799
sensitivity of it

497
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,919
the impact if it's closed

498
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,080
and hosting infrastructure

499
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,559
including applications

500
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,559
security level

501
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,520
how do we do that

502
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,720
with within tyler's gis

503
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,400
in order to build

504
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,120
a personal data protection framework

505
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,799
and implement privacy by design

506
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,480
we classify data based on impact

507
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,720
caused by unauthorized disclosure

508
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,679
these are what we use in our company

509
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,600
your companies should have your own

510
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,000
classification based on the personal

511
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,799
data you are dealing with

512
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,559
let's see our classifications

513
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,480
we classify data into three levels

514
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,600
high medium and low

515
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,400
for the high level

516
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,679
confidentiality breach

517
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,600
would cause serious harm to individuals

518
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,440
for example

519
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,360
physical social or financial harm

520
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,919
resulting in potential

521
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,520
loss of life

522
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,400
or loss of likelihood

523
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,240
for medium

524
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,039
level confidentiality breach

525
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,320
would cause

526
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,440
harm to

527
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,840
moderate harm to individuals

528
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
for example

529
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,039
financial loss

530
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,440
due to identity theft

531
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,000
or denial of benefit

532
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,640
public humiliation

533
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,760
or discrimination

534
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,279
for the low level confidentiality breach

535
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,000
would not cause individual harm more

536
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,600
than inconvenience

537
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,799
for example having to change

538
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,559
email address or password

539
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,480
let's see examples of what data belong

540
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,279
classification

541
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,799
for individual ids for example social

542
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,600
security number

543
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,520
national id number

544
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,799
passport

545
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,520
we classified as high

546
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,919
and health data

547
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,960
are classified as high and effect so is

548
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,520
financial data like card holder

549
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,799
payment history banking account number

550
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,200
and the locations

551
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,400
uh such as physical address uh gps

552
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,440
location ip address

553
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,720
and

554
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,440
classified as medium

555
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,840
so our public key

556
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,360
password

557
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,360
and the direct identifiers such as names

558
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,240
email address

559
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,799
facebook ids

560
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,600
those are classified as law

561
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,240
so these are what we do

562
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,279
in telus dis your company may do it

563
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,039
differently

564
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,159
data protection should be appropriate to

565
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,200
the classification

566
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,480
how much security protection that we

567
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,760
must apply to personal data in logs

568
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,720
depend on many factors

569
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
we should consider the data

570
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
classification

571
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,000
security level of the infrastructure

572
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,240
of end of the application

573
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,640
data in transit and the data at rest

574
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,200
the higher the classification level the

575
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,880
more protection is needed

576
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,360
let's talk about the production logs

577
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,080
we need to store production logs

578
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,080
security securely since logs may contain

579
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,480
personal data and other sensitive

580
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,400
information

581
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,080
do not allow public access

582
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,039
logs must be access controlled

583
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,919
we must protect logs from unauthorized

584
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,960
access to prevent attacks on the system

585
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,159
or harm

586
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,760
to individuals

587
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,559
or organizations

588
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,840
unauthorized access may allow attackers

589
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,360
to disclose

590
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,960
modify delete or forge log data for

591
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,360
their malicious purposes

592
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,080
and to hide their activities

593
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,799
this would this could leak sensitive

594
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,799
information and impact the

595
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,520
trustworthiness of the laws

596
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,480
which could mislead monitoring system

597
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,720
and auditors

598
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,960
there are many techniques

599
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,320
to protect personal data in logs

600
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,400
for example

601
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
anonymize

602
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,880
of skate obsession

603
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,159
mask

604
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,279
hash

605
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,720
tokenization

606
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,559
and encryption and etc

607
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,679
do not use

608
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,559
debug or trees log level

609
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,320
in production

610
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,279
because

611
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,320
they review too much information

612
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,120
about your system and possibly personal

613
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,320
data

614
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,399
if you have to in certain situations

615
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,039
for example

616
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,960
troubleshooting

617
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,080
and then you may temporarily

618
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,080
set it up set it up for a higher

619
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,039
for

620
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,600
a finer debugging level let's see debug

621
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,240
log level let's see debug

622
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,440
but you should turn back

623
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,600
to the original level as soon as

624
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,600
possible

625
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,640
protect locks in transit

626
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,760
do not send logs in clear

627
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,480
use secure communication channels for

628
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,240
example tls

629
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,799
authenticate both endpoints

630
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,200
make sure that your locks are going to

631
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,960
where they're supposed to

632
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,440
on the receiving end know that locks

633
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,279
come from where they're supposed to

634
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,799
in summary

635
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,480
logging personal data

636
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,559
must be justified

637
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,159
do not do it

638
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,720
unless it is necessary

639
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,159
if you have to

640
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,640
be compliant with gdpr

641
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,320
follow principles

642
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,120
of personal data processing and protect

643
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,239
those personal data

644
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,039
i want to give special thanks to mr
