here to help

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,760
hi everyone i'm veronica i'm otherwise

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,439
known as bee

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,039
i want to talk to you guys today about

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,519
something that's very close to my heart

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,279
little beauty that you see here on your

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,159
screen is actually my device

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,480
it is one that i got in january

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,079
today i want to talk to you about

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,840
falling water

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,399
my opinion my approach to medical device

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,120
vulnerability disclosure

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,680
so who am i

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,640
well

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,760
i started my life out as a cyborg

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,960
i was a goon for defcon i still am

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,039
i believe i'm a hacker builder and a

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,360
protector i am now an assistant

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,760
professor at north university

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,559
i also closely work with a manufacturer

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,119
dealing with cardiac devices in the us

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,600
so why is this talk so important to me

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,000
i spent the last nine months speaking to

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,400
engineers whether it be hardware whether

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,680
it be software firmware or security

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,080
trying to discuss with them what they

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,400
feel their constraints are

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,200
what

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,840
foods on what their opinions are i have

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,920
listened to understand

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,799
that three years ago i did not know when

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,119
i said that dealing with vulnerabilities

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,200
should be quicker what actually went

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,560
into it

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,840
but more so i was reminded in january

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,399
that a medical device will and can save

45
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,040
your lives

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,159
medical devices are important

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,399
medical devices are needed

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,680
they call functionality is after all

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
to give medical treatment to those that

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,079
need it

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,759
i always very much believe that the

52
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,880
process of designing medical devices are

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,119
beautiful and staggering and it has

54
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,360
evolved from years ago

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,920
we are seeing that that more treatment

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,720
options are available to patients

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,800
we've seen advancements in dealing with

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,879
chronic illnesses

59
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,800
but more importantly

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,599
every new device that it's designed

61
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,239
saves a life

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,720
so inevitably we have an extension of

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,840
our lives

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,319
if i think about myself i wouldn't be

65
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,480
here without my device

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,280
in fact i would have not achieved or

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
done everything that i've done without

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
having this piece of hardware and

69
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,280
software running my heart

70
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,000
i wanted to cover some terminology that

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,319
we will use in the space specifically

72
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
the sort because these are things that

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,560
if you are in the medical device

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,440
manufacturing world you know

75
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,840
mdm is how we refer to a medical device

76
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,080
manufacturer for me a medical device is

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,519
a device that was designed and

78
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,360
manufactured to be connected to a

79
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,640
patient

80
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,959
to give medical help medical assistance

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,519
or clinical

82
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,760
clinical diagnosis

83
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,400
a clinical device well that for me is

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
where it gets a little bit different

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,680
these are the endpoints that are

86
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,760
connected to a medical device or a

87
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,000
device containing clinical data of a

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,840
patient

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,599
then we have the electronic healthcare

90
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,959
records

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,840
otherwise known as the ehr

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,400
we have pre-market post-market placing

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,799
on market and these are all processes we

94
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,799
go through manufacturing to actually

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
bring our devices to market

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,159
then we have something which i am very

97
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,920
passionate about which is called

98
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,640
post-market surveillance

99
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,360
now

100
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,959
albeit i don't love the word

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,360
surveillance and i prefer monitoring

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,439
this enables us to have eyes on the

103
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,599
prize and know when our device to start

104
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,519
malfunctioning

105
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,920
some of these are very confusing and

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,720
they haven't been standardized so you

107
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
will hear people using it very

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,200
differently for my talk this is how i

109
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,159
will be using it

110
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,199
now there's no such thing as a

111
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,079
non-vulnerable device now i know sit

112
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,520
back relax

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,479
let me explain

114
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,759
today we design a device we've tested it

115
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,680
we've checked it and it's not been

116
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,120
vulnerable

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,040
but we need to understand that the

118
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,840
lifespan of these devices are not just

119
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,160
for a year or two

120
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,360
they are for 10. take into consideration

121
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,560
an implantable icd device

122
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,400
that device will last in a patient

123
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,320
between 10 and 17 years

124
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,960
because we cannot design with future in

125
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,479
mind meaning that

126
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,360
we can't predispose or have a magic ball

127
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,199
that will tell us what will become

128
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,240
vulnerable in the coming years

129
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,720
we need to understand that we need to be

130
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,440
adaptable and take on board that there's

131
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,039
no such thing as a non-vulnerable device

132
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,039
just like there is no thing no such

133
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,680
thing as an unhackable

134
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,120
system

135
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,600
at one point in its lifetime

136
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,840
it will be

137
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,199
vulnerable it's not so much the fact

138
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,600
that it is vulnerable but how you handle

139
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
that vulnerability how you deal with

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
that process and this is what i'm hoping

141
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
to highlight today

142
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,120
that we need to move away from having

143
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
an idea that we will never have

144
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,039
vulnerabilities vulnerabilities will

145
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,840
forever when you are building be part of

146
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,479
what you do

147
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,240
so let's discuss this further

148
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,479
there's no safety guarantees when

149
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,880
building medical devices

150
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,440
today the device can be safe tomorrow it

151
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,520
may not be

152
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,639
it is a risk management issue

153
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,800
you need to determine what the risk

154
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,520
management appetite of your organization

155
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,800
is

156
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,639
don't even get me started on the risk

157
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,600
management for patients

158
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,360
that is a conversation for another day

159
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,000
we need to know that everything we do

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,560
closely and aligns with how effective

161
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,960
the device is and how the device

162
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
performs

163
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,120
if i ask you functionally

164
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,479
what a medical device should do

165
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,759
you will all agree that it is there

166
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,080
to give medical treatment

167
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,000
it's a medical device after all

168
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,800
we need to consider the lifespan

169
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
these devices last for years you want to

170
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,240
talk legacy

171
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,479
you want to talk technical debt

172
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,319
let's have a discussion about medical

173
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,800
devices

174
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,080
these are

175
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,160
problems that faces a manufacturer's

176
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
every time

177
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,599
but there needs to be a shared

178
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,319
responsibility among stakeholders

179
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,639
as much as the manufacturers build these

180
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,160
devices

181
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,639
it's up to the whole community

182
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,840
to keep them protected

183
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,960
so let's discuss the waterfall approach

184
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,360
now i want to caveat this first i spent

185
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,680
the last nine months working very

186
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,240
closely together with developers

187
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,800
and you know engineers and security

188
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,880
people within mdms

189
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,039
i wanted to understand

190
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,000
how they built these devices i'm a big

191
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,560
geek i love the fact that i have this

192
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,680
piece of technology that is so simple

193
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,400
but so complex that i needed to

194
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,759
understand

195
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,599
how it was built

196
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,759
and the one thing that i realized is

197
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,199
that we are designing for hardware

198
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,759
and some of them like got use of a

199
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,919
standard waterfall approach

200
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,199
some make use of a combination

201
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,759
but i wanted to understand how devices

202
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,879
are built

203
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,879
i wanted to know more

204
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,960
i am not a developer

205
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,360
i'm a forensics person that wanted to

206
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,639
learn how device building works

207
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,800
the general waterfall approach has an

208
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,479
analysis phase

209
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,720
we have a design phase we have an

210
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,599
implementation phase a testing phase

211
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,919
deployment and maintenance

212
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,000
what's important to note here is that

213
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,719
everything is done within a silo

214
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,120
one phase has to finish for the next to

215
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,599
start

216
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,320
so let's consider why waterfall is still

217
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,279
used when building for embedded

218
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,519
implanted hardware

219
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,240
i want to stress that this is

220
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,360
specifically aimed at dealing with icd's

221
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,080
implantables and pacemakers

222
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,279
they are still developing for hardware

223
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,640
the hardware lasts for many years

224
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,839
in my case my new device will last if i

225
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,480
use it at a minimum for 17 years

226
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,600
they're not always as updatable

227
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,080
and and even just doing a ram ware

228
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,120
update

229
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,200
could have detrimental effects on the

230
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,560
patient

231
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,720
this is connected to a patient in the

232
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,680
most intimate form and way

233
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,240
at some point the code will be

234
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,839
vulnerable

235
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,040
if it isn't already

236
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,440
so how does it work

237
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,760
well for one process to

238
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,279
start the previous one had to finish

239
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,200
there's more of a linear and logical

240
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,839
separation of phases

241
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,720
so

242
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,839
can we translate this

243
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,000
so let's translate it we have to do a

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,920
feasibility study

245
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,560
is is it feasible for us to build this

246
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,839
device

247
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,680
will we have patients that need the

248
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,959
device

249
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,399
then we move on to

250
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,320
the design phase

251
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
the design phase is where we put down

252
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
our requirements

253
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,959
we start with system specifications we

254
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,640
start with hardware

255
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,760
we start with battery and sensors we get

256
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,480
to firm where we get to security

257
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,200
but each requirement is detailed right

258
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,440
in the beginning of it

259
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,360
then we move into our developmental

260
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,560
phase

261
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,880
when we start building the hardware we

262
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,800
start building the sensors we do the

263
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,600
batteries and we do the firmware

264
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,519
but what we need to realize is the

265
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,399
extent what we need to verify because

266
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,720
this device is going to go into a human

267
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,760
being

268
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,519
it's going to be connected to someone's

269
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,399
flesh

270
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,399
and blood heart

271
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,000
there needs to be a hundred percent

272
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,399
verification across everything that you

273
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,680
are doing

274
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,480
and it has to always pass

275
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,160
it can't fail fast it needs to be

276
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,839
functional

277
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,079
so when i say fail fast i mean that the

278
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,880
functionalities that it offers can never

279
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,920
be questioned the algorithms used need

280
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,640
to have the correct treatment response

281
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
once we've verified and gone through our

282
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,000
testing this is all validated and only

283
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,880
then will the design be transferred into

284
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,440
a conceptual product

285
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,519
and even then it still gets tested again

286
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,240
as you can see building medical devices

287
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,160
are not as straightforward as i thought

288
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,079
a couple of years ago

289
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,079
i am happy that i spent the time

290
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,000
learning how this was done because i

291
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,240
appreciate my own device so much more

292
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,480
now another thing that i realized is

293
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
that depending on the country that

294
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,639
you're in depends on the regulatory

295
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,240
considerations

296
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
for the purpose of this talk i didn't

297
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,720
focus on a specific country and i tried

298
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,560
to go on regulations that i used

299
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
globally

300
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
every country has different regulatory

301
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
considerations

302
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,079
but what we need to realize is for an

303
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,720
mbn to bring anything to market in that

304
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
country it needs to not only adhere to

305
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,959
global

306
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,880
standards or considerations for

307
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,200
regulations but it needs to do the local

308
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,760
ones as well for example you have the

309
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,519
fda in south africa has their own

310
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,040
so we look at the iso 1348 85 which is a

311
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,959
quality management system for medical

312
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,040
devices we have iso 2417

313
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,440
medical devices information which needs

314
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,839
to be supplied by the manufacturer

315
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,120
we have iso 14971 application risk

316
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,440
management for medical devices

317
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,920
we will talk a lot about risk management

318
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,079
in this conversation because i've

319
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,360
realized when we deal with

320
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,120
vulnerabilities we are doing risk

321
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,800
management

322
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,639
we have iec 62304 2006 which is the

323
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,200
medical device software

324
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,680
standard it deals with the software life

325
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
cycle processes

326
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
it makes mention of how software for

327
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,160
medical devices should be built

328
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
what the requirements are

329
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,680
and specifically deals with medical

330
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
device software

331
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,519
this is probably the one that i've read

332
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,399
the most and i found to be exceptionally

333
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,959
comprehensive

334
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,480
i'm not going to be mentioning all of

335
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,440
them

336
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,720
because i have probably five pages full

337
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
i wanted to highlight the ones that i

338
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,600
have seen use across the board the most

339
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,760
but the idea here is not to talk about

340
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,519
regulations or tell you about the

341
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,480
considerations but to say to you that it

342
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,240
is more complex than just putting

343
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
together a device

344
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,240
there are many facets to go into

345
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,440
building these devices

346
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
we have the newer guidance the

347
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,360
manufacturer disclosure statement we

348
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,639
have iectr 8001

349
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,639
application of risk management for i.t

350
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,279
networks we have nist standards

351
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,279
and so forth

352
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,639
there are

353
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,440
regulatory considerations globally for

354
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,240
medical devices

355
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,000
now this is probably the one that made

356
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,440
me the most excited i got to see the

357
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
unit testing as well as the functional

358
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,160
testing of a device

359
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,639
and what i realized was that some of

360
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,959
these tests that even are

361
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,560
automated takes so long they so

362
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,079
comprehensive

363
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,320
they have to have a hundred percent

364
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,680
parts

365
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,160
meaning that if we have a function that

366
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,800
has multiple variables all those

367
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,040
variables need to be a hundred percent

368
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,519
tested and they need to pass a hundred

369
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,199
percent of the time

370
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,480
again there's no room for failure

371
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,560
when i say failure i mean the functional

372
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,240
failure

373
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,680
we've seen devices grow old we've seen

374
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,199
devices become vulnerable but these are

375
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,600
just the natural progression of dealing

376
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,800
with software and dealing with hardware

377
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,120
the testing process that these devices

378
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,440
go through are rigorous

379
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,560
they are also awesomely interesting

380
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,040
sitting and watching specific functions

381
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,680
that i know i my device has

382
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,000
made me realize

383
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,560
that even though the inners or the guts

384
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,800
of the device look simple

385
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,360
the firmware contained on it

386
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,720
is astronomically complex

387
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,440
and i sat back and thought to myself

388
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,720
that if we now make changes

389
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,120
and we have to taste this again

390
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,440
how was it dealt with how do we deal

391
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
with the vulnerabilities

392
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,959
a couple of years ago i said

393
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,279
vulnerability should be dealt with fast

394
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,040
and ferociously

395
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,360
but i realized that that was playing it

396
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,839
fast and playing it

397
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,920
loose when we deal with medical devices

398
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,639
any changes we make have a real world

399
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,120
impact and they need to be rigorous

400
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,480
rigorously tested

401
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,639
so now we get to dealing with

402
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,720
vulnerabilities

403
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,800
now i don't want to say i've been

404
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,519
fortunate but i feel that my experiences

405
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,199
as a patient

406
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,880
have led me to look at the world

407
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,040
differently

408
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,199
in these last three years i have grown

409
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,360
to understand that vulnerabilities are

410
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,160
something i will be faced with every day

411
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,800
whether it be my physical

412
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,639
vulnerabilities whether it be my

413
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,880
software or hardware

414
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,399
and i will take you through that a

415
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,240
little later

416
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,360
i asked the question we have responsible

417
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,320
vulnerability disclosure programs we

418
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,839
have all of that

419
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,639
but what happens when a vulnerability is

420
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,639
disclosed

421
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,800
and i had conversations and i wanted to

422
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,720
understand

423
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,959
how it's dealt with and i kind of came

424
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,519
to the realization that if i didn't know

425
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,199
perhaps anyone else didn't know

426
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,039
so let's have a look at it we've done

427
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,599
our system definition we've designed our

428
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,760
product we've implemented it we've

429
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,240
tested and validated it and we've gone

430
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,520
to market

431
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,319
and then comes the most tricky part we

432
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,559
have to maintain the integrity of that

433
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,079
device

434
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,199
but now our vulnerability is disclosed

435
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,599
now my question is do we start right at

436
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,240
the beginning

437
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,520
well yes we kind of do

438
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,440
because it has to go through the same

439
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
process again

440
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,000
we can't make changes to a device

441
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
without ensuring the safety of the

442
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,360
patient but more so the integrity and

443
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
the functionality of the changes we

444
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,039
bring

445
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,360
also it gets pretty tricky to start

446
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,880
changing hard way

447
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,559
it's one thing dealing with a flaw in

448
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,320
the vulnerability but a whole different

449
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,559
ballgame when a device is implanted into

450
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,880
someone and now you have a hardware

451
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,840
problem

452
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,919
so

453
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,160
i've heard comments made that why can't

454
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
we deal with medical devices the way

455
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,280
that microsoft amazon google deals with

456
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,120
their devices

457
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,880
well it is a bit more complex than that

458
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,080
now my question is is 30 days enough

459
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,200
is 30 days enough to complete the whole

460
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,080
cycle and have a fresh ramway update or

461
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,840
new software update for you to run

462
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
well it kind of depends

463
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,840
now that is the simple answer

464
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,240
now i'm going to ask you this

465
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,120
right 30 days seems plausible to have a

466
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,360
conversation and have a notification

467
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,600
that there is a vulnerability

468
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,000
but having a solution in that time might

469
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
be hard

470
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
and the reason being that we have to go

471
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,559
through multiple steps to ensure that

472
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,960
when we are dealing with vulnerabilities

473
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,760
we don't break something

474
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,919
how many developers out there have had

475
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,000
to fix a bug and then ended up

476
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,799
introducing vulnerabilities and extra

477
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,720
problems within their code if not

478
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,760
inevitably break it

479
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,880
now

480
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,720
imagine working on something that is

481
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,679
implanted in someone

482
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,480
someone that's looking up to you

483
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,080
and trusting you

484
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,280
to not break their device

485
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,039
so it depends

486
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,039
it depends on the manufacturer's

487
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,160
willingness to engage the researcher

488
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,360
it depends on the researcher's

489
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,679
comprehensive findings

490
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,840
it depends on the problem that's been

491
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,760
found

492
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,440
so my easy answer to that is it depends

493
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,520
and it is a technical and forensic term

494
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,360
we often use when doing cases

495
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,480
so okay

496
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,240
we've now confirmed that there's a

497
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,559
vulnerability

498
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,799
now there's a picture of dolbert that

499
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,919
comes to mind streaming help help how

500
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,799
well

501
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,960
not necessarily

502
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,080
but we need to this is an important step

503
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,919
we need to confirm that it's indeed a

504
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,840
vulnerability

505
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,440
now again i'm not saying that it's

506
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,919
exploitable i simply said that there's

507
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,559
something that's vulnerable

508
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,039
now

509
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,000
do we test it again if we are expected

510
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,400
to functionally test everything and do

511
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,120
unit testing for everything and have it

512
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,320
passed 100 of the time

513
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,240
should we then be testing whether

514
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,880
something's exploitable

515
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,360
it is kind of an important step i would

516
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,200
say

517
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,640
because would we deal with the

518
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,720
vulnerability as that is just a

519
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,840
vulnerability that is not

520
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,760
exploitable no certainly not i'm pretty

521
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,799
sure in the software that you design or

522
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,960
hardware that you build if it's simply

523
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,120
vulnerable but not exploitable you won't

524
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,840
spend the extra manpower to fix it

525
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,360
certainly when something becomes

526
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,720
exploitable

527
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,400
we start seeing an increase in risk

528
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,760
so how do we assess the severity

529
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,880
well

530
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,480
there is something that's used in the

531
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,919
industry

532
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:14,840
we have

533
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,360
negligible okay so it's mining

534
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,840
inconvenience or a temporary discomfort

535
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,520
we have minor

536
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,080
which results in an injury or impairment

537
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,600
but it doesn't really require your

538
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,520
doctor to help you

539
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,240
you have serious okay this is where a

540
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,440
doctor needs to intervene critical

541
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,200
this could result in a permanent

542
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,919
impairment or life-threatening injury

543
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,080
catastrophic is the thing we never want

544
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,520
to have happen

545
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,840
and that results in a patient's death

546
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,640
now

547
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,200
i need to ask you a big question do we

548
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,440
fix all the vulnerabilities do we fix

549
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,720
all the bugs

550
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,760
do we fix everything

551
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,840
this may be difficult to determine the

552
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,120
impact on patient safety

553
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,919
it gets even more so complicated when

554
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,799
the device is implanted

555
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,919
also

556
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,320
a vulnerability might not be exploitable

557
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,480
often in iit security we push for

558
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,880
integrity and confidentiality

559
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,120
but in medical devices we need to push

560
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,679
more for availability

561
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,600
would you rather have a device that is

562
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,840
so secure that it no longer becomes

563
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,520
available

564
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,000
no longer functions as a medical device

565
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,320
because now its core functionality is to

566
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,880
be secure

567
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,280
it also depends on the device it is much

568
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,799
easier updating a home monitor or even a

569
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,799
patient bedside monitor

570
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,679
an infusion pump than it is to deal with

571
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,919
embedded implanted devices there is

572
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,360
certainly not one you know one easy

573
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,960
one-size-fits-all solution i kind of

574
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,120
wish there was because i'd have a lot

575
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,000
less work to do

576
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,559
now this is a very personal story of

577
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,679
mine last year november i first had an

578
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,320
issue with the firmware of my device

579
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,400
which we managed to do a ram way update

580
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,600
for

581
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,400
however what we did not realize was that

582
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
the leads connected to my device

583
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,880
malfunctioned i now had an hardware

584
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,880
issue

585
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,520
i spent months trying to convince my

586
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,000
doctor that the device was indeed lying

587
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
to him

588
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
that the device was wrong that the

589
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,159
device was not correct

590
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,720
i was resuscitated twice november

591
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,080
december

592
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,320
due to my device not giving me the

593
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,760
life-saving therapy i so need it

594
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,080
now you ask me what happened

595
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,480
well my leads were in from my previous

596
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,240
pacemaker this is device number two

597
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,120
i

598
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,480
lovingly call her lilith

599
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,440
due to that the device was not able to

600
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,760
sense the electrical activity within my

601
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,200
heart

602
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,520
meaning according to the device all was

603
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,200
well

604
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,440
but my hard way failed

605
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,159
there was a vulnerability now not an

606
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,720
exploitable one but one that caused

607
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,960
severe and critical risk to me

608
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,520
how did i solve that problem well it's

609
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,400
easy for me i am an e-patient i'm very

610
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,240
involved in the technology that goes

611
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,760
into my body

612
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,320
i was able to pull on my forensic

613
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,840
experience

614
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,919
and i dumped the data off my apple

615
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,279
health kit

616
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,559
i used python to script it out

617
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,720
and understand what was happening in my

618
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,159
heart

619
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,559
i then took the data from my pacemaker

620
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,880
and compared it and could show the

621
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,320
doctors

622
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,400
and fight for it that there was a

623
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,559
discrepancy

624
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,799
i raised the vulnerability with them

625
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,360
that now needed to be investigated

626
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,840
and we had to do our own testing

627
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,080
and in january after a fight with my

628
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,760
insurance i received new leads

629
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,480
new device

630
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,760
and a new lease on life

631
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,080
this is a very personal journey to me

632
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,279
but this is just the difference between

633
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,320
not having the energy to get up

634
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,650
versus the energy to get up

635
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,799
[Music]

636
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,039
now let's discuss what vulnerabilities

637
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,880
and you know what a vulnerability is and

638
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,039
how they are dealt with

639
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,039
i as a researcher now founder

640
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,080
vulnerability what do i do now

641
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,159
most medical manufacturers have a

642
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,200
disclosure program you need to go to

643
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,039
is it going to be easy

644
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,840
probably not the conversations need to

645
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,120
be difficult

646
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,919
does that mean we give up no you keep

647
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,600
pushing on

648
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,679
we should be able to have discussions

649
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,919
about vulnerabilities

650
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,159
but you as the researcher also have a

651
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,799
responsibility to write it up as

652
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,080
comprehensive as you can

653
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,120
so

654
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,360
now you've sent the vulnerability report

655
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,200
to the mda

656
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,520
now sometimes this is where the process

657
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,679
absolutely stops

658
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,080
communication is set down and legal

659
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,320
teams are called

660
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,440
i had this experience three years ago

661
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,799
we kept working at it for three years

662
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,039
and we are now successfully finally

663
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,400
working together

664
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,240
as a team rather than as adversaries

665
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
this is something that the community is

666
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,240
actively working on

667
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,919
but now we've seen

668
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,480
that sometimes it doesn't work out and

669
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,559
it stops right there

670
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,639
and the process doesn't progress anymore

671
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,799
but now once you've sent your

672
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,799
vulnerability report to the medical

673
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,919
medical manufacturer what happens next

674
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,480
well sometimes it gets filled in a draw

675
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,600
joking joking no they need to confirm

676
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,120
your findings

677
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,520
they can't just accept and say that yes

678
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,840
this is indeed correct unless your

679
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,080
report is very comprehensive and very

680
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,279
scientific

681
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,640
they will need to confirm this

682
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,279
vulnerability for themselves

683
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,200
they would need to confirm whether they

684
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,080
are even vulnerable to this or the way

685
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,559
that they've implemented the the flaw

686
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,000
that was raised

687
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,640
is indeed a problem

688
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,880
again throughout this process you'll see

689
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,159
that a lot of risk assessment is done

690
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,360
decisions are made

691
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,200
okay

692
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,720
now once we've confirmed the

693
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,120
vulnerability well we need to identify

694
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,880
the impact

695
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,840
now in manufacturing there is a bill of

696
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,120
materials there's an s form a c bomb

697
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,679
they are all these things they are

698
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,880
ideally asset tracking you need to know

699
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,960
what goes into the device that you are

700
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,480
building

701
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,360
you need to track your fleet you need to

702
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,520
know what you have and where you have it

703
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,360
implemented

704
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,440
because heaven forbid you are faced with

705
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,320
a vulnerability that you have confirmed

706
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,399
but you do not know which devices are

707
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,399
impacted

708
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,960
these are responsibilities and ownership

709
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
that medical manufacturers need to take

710
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,559
on themselves

711
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,799
this is not a process that anyone can do

712
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,799
for them

713
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,200
in terms of dealing with flaws acid

714
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,240
management is a success for fast

715
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,840
identification

716
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,360
of flaws within your feet

717
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,640
now

718
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,880
we have identified that there is an

719
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,919
impact to the devices we have

720
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,159
but now we need to do that very big

721
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,640
thing that no one likes to do we need to

722
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,960
assess the risk

723
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,480
not only the risk to fixing the risk to

724
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,000
not fixing the risk of leading this in

725
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,480
dealing with vulnerabilities is as much

726
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,640
a technical thing as it is a risk

727
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,000
assessment

728
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,960
a risk is acceptance it is all about

729
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
what is your appetite as an

730
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,760
organizational manufacturer

731
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,320
in terms of the risk

732
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,399
once you've identified and completed

733
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,640
your risk analysis portion

734
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,600
you will move on to actually deciding

735
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,159
whether or not you will issue the fix or

736
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,320
recall the device

737
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,720
now there are two options here

738
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,440
you can try and fix the problem and

739
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,840
sometimes it is just slapping a band-aid

740
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
onto a bigger problem

741
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,799
and you end up not being able to fix it

742
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,880
well you have the flip side

743
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,279
where you do fix it and you inevitably

744
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,520
break the device

745
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,640
and it ends up in a recall

746
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,399
now i'm going to give you this example

747
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,960
i had an issue with my firmware which we

748
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,399
will manage to successfully fix

749
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,080
and if you've ever done a firmware

750
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,399
update you know that you pray from the

751
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,640
start until it's completed

752
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,760
because inevitably it might break

753
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,120
but there's a bit more at risk here

754
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,200
the fact is this device is within

755
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,640
someone so we need to identify

756
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,159
and do risk analysis to determine

757
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,799
whether or not fixing the device or

758
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,520
fixing the floor inevitably might take

759
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
away the functionality

760
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,159
of the device it might break it it might

761
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,919
break it

762
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,039
it might

763
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,559
introduce other vulnerabilities

764
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,640
when i made the decision in january to

765
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,600
go back to previous version of a device

766
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,440
i knew that there was vulnerabilities

767
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,120
within the device

768
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
but again i had to choose between

769
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,159
functionalities and vulnerabilities

770
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,480
and i chose the functionality of it

771
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,360
because i wanted to live

772
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,559
i was going through physical surgery

773
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,200
i wanted to be sure

774
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,279
that the device that i got was the one

775
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,000
that was functionally and clinically the

776
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,240
perfect one for me

777
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,120
unfortunately there was a vulnerability

778
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,000
it's not necessarily an exploitable one

779
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,919
not today that is

780
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,440
but i had to take that risk mitigating

781
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,360
decision

782
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,559
do i

783
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,279
try a new device that might not be

784
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,840
functionally perfect for me

785
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,320
or do i embrace the vulnerability of my

786
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,799
device and let the functionalities

787
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,000
outweigh the vulnerable portion of it

788
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,840
i did

789
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,159
and i can tell you that having quality

790
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,919
of life back

791
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,399
versus having this uber secure device

792
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,799
that's not clinically perfect for me

793
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,840
was an easy decision as a patient

794
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,960
unfortunately most patients are not my

795
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,080
age they're much older

796
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,000
and this is why it's so important that

797
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,840
we take on board the dealing with

798
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,480
vulnerabilities of embedded devices is

799
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,519
not a paper-based exercise there is a

800
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,720
human being that might need to go in for

801
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,080
painful

802
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,000
unpleasant surgery

803
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,640
i wanted to show you the pictures of my

804
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,120
experience because

805
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,360
it made me realize that having surgery

806
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,399
was not

807
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,519
easy

808
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,440
the longer you have your device the

809
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,519
worse it becomes and harder it becomes

810
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,320
to remove it

811
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,760
and then

812
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,159
in the final portion of dealing with it

813
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,320
once we've decided whether we can issue

814
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,440
the fix

815
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,200
now we need to get the patients to come

816
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,760
in so that we can introduce the fix

817
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,240
this is not something that you can do

818
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,200
automatically or push over the wire

819
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,880
this is something that needs to be done

820
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,200
under a controlled environment again

821
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,399
updating and dealing with

822
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,640
vulnerabilities and devices which is not

823
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,440
implanted in a patient is much easier

824
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,679
than dealing with patients that have

825
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,720
devices implanted

826
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,840
now i've highlighted the process to you

827
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,720
so how do we make it move faster

828
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,880
because if you think about it some of

829
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,799
the functional testing

830
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,600
can take weeks if you have many

831
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,480
variables that it have to run through as

832
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,799
a researcher when you're doing a

833
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,880
vulnerability disclosure

834
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,039
try and be comprehensive with your

835
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,159
findings put examples put the code you

836
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,120
used put as much information that you

837
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,679
can to make the mdms take note

838
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,799
medical manufacturers are trying to

839
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,600
change the conversation

840
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,840
very slowly but these are big

841
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,600
organizations

842
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,360
they are big silos to break down

843
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,679
but if a medical manufacturer comes back

844
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,679
with a negative response

845
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,000
you as a researcher need to push them

846
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
further you need to push them out of

847
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,320
their comfort zone you need to make them

848
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,360
listen

849
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,840
i often said why am i the only one

850
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,760
shouting the loudest in the room about

851
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,840
us

852
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,679
and you know what three years later it's

853
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:02,640
fatal

854
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,480
it was not easy

855
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,440
it wasn't pleasant

856
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,359
i am pretty sure i got called names

857
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,040
behind my back

858
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,960
but i have a device

859
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,599
i want to build them better i am so

860
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,079
tired of having to hear that i cannot

861
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,918
have something because we didn't build

862
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,679
it that way

863
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,800
i want to build this in

864
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,239
how are we going to deal with

865
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,239
vulnerabilities well we are going to

866
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,040
deal with it by building in the capacity

867
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,679
to deal with them

868
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,918
meaning we have to start developing and

869
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,000
building for the future

870
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,239
we need to anticipate

871
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,359
what may become vulnerable

872
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,760
when we are dealing with vulnerabilities

873
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,399
we need to be better at identifying the

874
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,760
impact

875
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
and mdm needs to have their asset

876
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,000
management on point

877
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,918
this is something which is your

878
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,599
responsibility

879
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,920
it's not anyone else's

880
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,839
make sure you know what goes into your

881
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,119
product

882
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,079
when we do risk analysis don't just look

883
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,720
at the paper consider the perspective of

884
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
the patient

885
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,200
when you decide to do a ram wear

886
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
or software fix

887
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,800
make sure that you've tested it

888
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,480
comprehensively

889
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,359
don't rush to a fix

890
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,839
because you've afraid

891
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,200
i'm going to point the finger because

892
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,359
you've taken the extra time to properly

893
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,480
test it

894
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,960
you cannot fail at this portion you need

895
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,200
to be successful in whatever you decide

896
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,680
to implement

897
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,640
and you don't have to fix it all

898
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,000
sometimes a bug doesn't need to be fixed

899
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,560
sometimes even for better vulnerability

900
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,480
doesn't need to be fixed

901
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,280
sometimes we need to outweigh the fix

902
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,320
versus what it might introduce

903
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,560
the last thing you want is to do a minor

904
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,800
fix now in a couple of years there's a

905
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,640
major fix that has to be done and the

906
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,839
cpu cycles aren't available for that

907
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,560
then we inevitably end up in surgery for

908
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,640
a patient

909
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,920
if you choose to recall a device

910
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,680
you should be sure

911
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,520
that you are willing to put a patient

912
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,359
through surgery

913
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,320
again i often feel implanted devices are

914
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,760
forgotten

915
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,440
i feel like it's something it's that

916
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,760
it's the ginger step child of the

917
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,520
medical device world

918
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,640
but it is the coolest device there is

919
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,240
except a friend of mine would say that

920
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,119
your neck healthy records are but we all

921
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,200
have our poison

922
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,520
and i find the way that these things are

923
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,800
built magnificently beautiful

924
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,720
but we need to take on board that we

925
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,359
will deal with vulnerabilities we will

926
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,079
deal with devices that break this is

927
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,800
often all technology and this is not

928
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,400
something you can switch on and off and

929
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,839
hope it works again
