1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,560
hello everyone uh welcome to this talk

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,480
about maturity categories for security

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,799
champions uh thank you to all uh who

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,880
have chosen to watch this talk

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,920
um this talk is in two parts uh so the

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,400
talk is um

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,079
firstly about security champions and

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,320
then we'll cover the project uh which is

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,920
maturity categories for security

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,400
champions

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,160
so introductions first my name is gareth

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
dixon i'm a principal test engineer at

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,119
sage

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,079
i also lead the uk and ireland security

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,920
champion community and i've done that

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,079
for four years now

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,879
i support the wasp and newcastle uk

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,079
chapter

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,239
when i can and i'm also studying for a

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,600
master's degree

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,879
in cyber security

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,120
i'll just go through a bit of background

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,120
about the company that i work for so i

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,480
work for sage

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,600
sage was founded in the uk in 1981

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,280
and we're a global supplier of business

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,640
software

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,719
for businesses ranging from startups up

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,640
to enterprise

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,680
we've got

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,519
13 000 colleagues

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,799
and of those 2500 are engineers

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,479
and within the engineering community we

34
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,200
have 200 security champions now

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,840
and we support a global security team

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,479
who have 45 members

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,680
we're an active supporter of a wasp and

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
current and former sage employees have

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,840
created a number of olaus

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,840
and where we have offices

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,880
we also support chapters through

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,600
attendance or actually some of the sage

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,960
employees

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,158
or offices for those chapters

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,560
so i'm going to go through basically how

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,200
i got started as a security champion and

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,320
this started about four years ago

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,720
so the internal security team created an

49
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,960
initiative which was called raising the

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,360
bar and the raising in the bar

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
initiative was about introducing a

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,280
security champion program within sage in

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
the engineering teams

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,520
initially that presentation the the

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,600
project was shared with the leadership

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,360
uh within the organization to ensure

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,520
that we had buy-in and commitment

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
from a leadership perspective

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,239
and we'd be able to roll that out into

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,800
the engineering teams

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,239
so at that time

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,480
i was actually a people leader

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,080
i've been in engineering for 10 years

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
now but uh i worked my way up to a

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,319
people leader and at the time i actually

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,440
made the decision that i wanted to

67
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,560
return to a tech role

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
i was very interested in security didn't

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,879
consider myself an expert at the time

70
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,480
but i had good work and relationships

71
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,680
with the security team within sage

72
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
so

73
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,959
the raising the bar presentation the

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,560
raising the bar program was actually

75
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,400
rolled out within sage

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,239
and i sat down with one of the security

77
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,040
team

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,560
and volunteered to help out through

79
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,480
leading that program in the uk and

80
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,519
ireland

81
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,360
so when we started out

82
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
uh we had quite a flat structure in the

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,080
uk islands so we had about 38 security

84
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,519
champions spread across different

85
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,800
offices

86
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,239
and one lead champion which was myself

87
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,040
so

88
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,959
after a bit of analysis and reflection

89
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,800
that structure really wasn't working so

90
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,720
what we did was introduce the concept of

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
a lead security champion

92
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,200
and they would attend a weekly meeting

93
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
with other lead security champions which

94
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,680
would effectively be an engine for

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,480
collaboration and increasing security

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,000
maturity throughout the organization

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,360
so what's it like to be a security

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,080
champion at sage um

99
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
i get involved with a lot of other teams

100
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,000
which i normally wouldn't be involved

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,920
with because

102
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,519
my expertise

103
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,440
uh now is sought after within the

104
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
organization

105
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,239
i've built good relationship

106
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,040
relationships with the global security

107
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,239
team

108
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,360
and

109
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,599
i undertake a lot of training

110
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,680
and participate in internal and external

111
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,400
events relating to security

112
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,560
the security champion role essentially

113
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,799
gives me a lot more opportunities from a

114
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,799
personal development point of view but

115
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,360
also um from a career perspective as

116
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,920
well um as i'll be looking at some point

117
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,239
to move into a purely security focused

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,560
role i think

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,120
so what do security champions do um so

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,399
essentially what we do is take

121
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,079
responsibility for

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,240
um bringing security milestones into the

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,720
development life cycle

124
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,479
if there are any issues we escalate them

125
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,800
to the security team

126
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,040
and what we do is also look at using

127
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,919
maturity models and perform gap analysis

128
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,160
to see if there are areas of focus that

129
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,840
we need to work on to improve our

130
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,919
security maturity

131
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,840
we learn about the internal processes

132
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,919
that we have relating to security

133
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,160
controls uh threat modeling and the

134
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,680
definition of done

135
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,440
and ensure that the

136
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,360
engineering teams are actually

137
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,160
um using those and adhering to those so

138
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,040
that

139
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,520
we reach our own standards for security

140
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,120
within the within the life cycle

141
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,880
we learn about remote with security

142
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,600
tools so whether that be uh sas or das

143
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,160
tools dependency checkers etc

144
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
also how we build security into our

145
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,840
automation

146
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,520
and we also look at vulnerability

147
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,039
tracking so whether that be through

148
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,080
internal activities or external um pen

149
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,039
tests

150
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,440
uh we ensure that we have um

151
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
trackers for those for different

152
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,360
products and services

153
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,080
we have internal champion meetups uh so

154
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,160
we run internal conferences for security

155
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,080
champions i've already mentioned the

156
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,160
weekly security champion leeds meeting

157
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,000
that we use as an engine an engine for

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,639
collaboration

159
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,919
we also undertake training and

160
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,840
certifications so

161
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,080
we have an internal training program for

162
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,919
security champions

163
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,759
and we also have security champions

164
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,600
who've gone through

165
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,919
recognized certifications in the area of

166
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,400
security

167
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,680
we've built a safe security portal

168
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,280
which is essentially a central

169
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
repository for security information

170
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,240
relating to policies and standards

171
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,840
security information relating to

172
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,479
particular application tech stacks

173
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,400
also information around our definition

174
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,600
of done and the use of maturity models

175
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,680
as well

176
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,039
we collaborate with other security

177
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,039
champions around the organization so

178
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,120
i've mentioned that we have

179
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,360
essentially a global organization so

180
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,800
security champions from different

181
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,720
regions will collaborate as well

182
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,479
and also we look to

183
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,319
spend time volunteering

184
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,759
for things like

185
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,280
digital defenders

186
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,520
or stem outreach programs where we help

187
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,800
out

188
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,160
local students or organizations uh when

189
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,720
it comes to improving security or

190
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,199
knowledge of security

191
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,639
so security champions uh are recommended

192
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,720
by a number of different uh maturity

193
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
models or programs

194
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,599
so i've already kind of mentioned basim

195
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,840
there's also a wasp sam safe code guide

196
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,800
nist

197
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,400
sans uh mozilla verifier code and check

198
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,639
marks and there's also the

199
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,440
um wasp security champions playbook

200
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,000
which was created by alexander antook

201
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,080
so why have security champions

202
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
essentially this is all about increasing

203
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,039
our

204
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,160
upset maturity really within an

205
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,880
organization security champions can

206
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,960
increase the maturity of security within

207
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,680
the organization by undertaking training

208
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,919
themselves or depending on their level

209
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,440
of expertise

210
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,360
they can deliver training to others

211
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
within the organization

212
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,599
uh within sage the security champion

213
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,919
program has been recognized as a

214
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,840
cornerstone to our upset journey over

215
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,599
the last four years

216
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,160
and that influences things like strategy

217
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,360
and metrics when it comes to security

218
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,080
a lot of our security champions as well

219
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
undertake security testing or work with

220
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
external consultants around pen testing

221
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,080
as well

222
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,000
and also look at how we bring in

223
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
security code reviews uh to our products

224
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,280
and services too

225
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,160
so let's have a look at some of the

226
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,599
statistics uh from the latest bsim

227
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,080
saw the bsim which is building security

228
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,759
and maturity model

229
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,759
basically that looks at um

230
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,520
a number of different firms who signed

231
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,440
up to undertake

232
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,039
an assessment under the b7 framework

233
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,240
and in the last version 122 firms uh

234
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,679
completed this

235
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,519
and that represents 468 000 developers

236
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,240
6298

237
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,720
satellite members in this context are

238
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
security champions

239
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
and ssg members which are the core

240
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,200
security personnel within a particular

241
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,240
organization that would be 1596.

242
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,440
if you look at the top

243
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,880
create a growing satellite which is

244
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,680
essentially a security champions program

245
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,920
42.6

246
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,800
of firms have that in place

247
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,880
but if you look at the bottom uh where

248
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,839
we've got

249
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,160
a reward progression through curriculum

250
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,839
for those who are effectively in

251
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,680
security champion rules

252
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,319
only 2.5 percent have that in place

253
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,640
so what does ospan say about security

254
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,320
champions so that would be the owasp

255
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,560
security maturity model

256
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,399
so basically have you identified a

257
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,040
security champion for each dev team

258
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,120
all the security champions are receiving

259
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
appropriate training

260
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,279
do you train your architects and other

261
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,880
stakeholders in practical threat

262
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,399
modeling

263
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,560
and to the application security and dev

264
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,320
teams receive periodic briefings from

265
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,279
security champions

266
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,000
maturity level 2 looks at product

267
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
champions and whether they are

268
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,959
responsible for promoting the use of

269
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,880
security tools

270
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,680
but in the context of this talk uh we're

271
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,440
really interested in maturity level

272
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
three

273
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
which is developing a platform to help

274
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,560
identify future members of the security

275
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,160
software of excellence

276
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,040
or

277
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,640
security champions based on their

278
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,560
expertise and willingness to help others

279
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
so

280
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,360
we want to understand really how we

281
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,320
recognize and reward security champions

282
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,279
and

283
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,800
one of the key things really that we

284
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,079
need to look at

285
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,600
is

286
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,720
knowledge

287
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
so knowledge itself can be a reward and

288
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,959
through personal development and trading

289
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,320
increasing your skills and your

290
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,079
capabilities is is is a good thing but

291
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,279
one of the things that we should really

292
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,800
look at is things like career

293
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,079
advancement

294
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,839
as having increasing skills and

295
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,680
increasing capabilities

296
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,519
uh individuals who are undertaking those

297
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,040
security champion roles really want to

298
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,240
look at

299
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,079
what does this mean for my career how

300
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,880
can i progress

301
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,519
also corporate training uh that's

302
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,000
something which um

303
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,920
we would deliver to security champions

304
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,760
over and above the standard

305
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,360
basic training which engineers would

306
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,880
receive

307
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,839
but a

308
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,600
software security group essentially

309
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,360
which is the internal security team for

310
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,519
an organization really need to have a

311
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,440
means to monitor security knowledge in

312
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,079
the

313
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,240
in the firm

314
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,399
in terms of some internal events

315
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,279
you know

316
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,760
prizes like coffee mugs and t-shirts are

317
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,200
nice to haves

318
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,519
but really um it's going to take the

319
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
possibility of a real career progression

320
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,480
to change behavior

321
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,800
so thank you for listening i hope you

322
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,279
find that insightful um and now i'm

323
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,959
going to hand over to lucian colin who's

324
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,240
going to talk about the second part of

325
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,079
this talk which is the maturity

326
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,600
categories for security champions

327
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,720
project

328
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,079
thanks for listening

329
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,880
thanks very much gareth for uh taking

330
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,279
care of part one of this presentation

331
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,560
um

332
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,480
it was obviously very very important to

333
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,079
introduce the concept of security

334
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,680
champions first

335
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,519
uh to kind of understand

336
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,800
uh what's happening with this concept

337
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,560
around the world

338
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,800
it is the reason why we insisted on bsim

339
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,000
10

340
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,240
and the statistics

341
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,000
it is important to understand that there

342
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,079
are a number of organizations and

343
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,680
standards which recommend security

344
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,279
champions

345
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,639
and basically

346
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,959
it is my duty now to introduce the

347
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,000
project

348
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,079
which will help you manage

349
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,200
uh some of the later stages of a

350
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,120
security champions initiative

351
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,200
mostly focusing on the maturity levels

352
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,279
two and three

353
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,480
um i'm lucian i

354
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,720
work in sage

355
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,959
i am the opsec head

356
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,600
lead the application security team

357
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,120
in sage

358
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,560
i used to work for osp

359
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,040
obviously in a volunteer

360
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,600
a manner a chapter lead for one of the

361
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
romanian chapters i'm currently

362
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,839
supporting the uk chapter

363
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,240
um been working in security for a while

364
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,399
now in upsec in the apsec field for

365
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,120
about six to seven years

366
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,480
and in general security for a long time

367
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,760
and

368
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,160
you can check my security weekly

369
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,320
at securitystock.com

370
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,480
i extract

371
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,800
those news which i believe are relevant

372
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,600
especially for upset people

373
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
and i post them

374
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,720
once a week so if you're interested you

375
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,000
can check

376
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,199
this weekly

377
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,600
my website

378
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,279
i will

379
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,279
go through the project now we came up

380
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,279
with a name for it which is maturity

381
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,079
categories for security champions

382
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,600
maybe uh this name can change uh but i

383
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,440
will explain the reasons why we chose

384
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,720
this name

385
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,320
um it's because security champions uh

386
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,360
need to evolve and we need to tell them

387
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,199
how they need to evolve

388
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,440
um because they will know themselves

389
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,399
some of them i guess my guess how

390
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,160
most of them might not and i think it's

391
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,120
the the duty of the security team

392
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
which by the way some of them

393
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,519
as gareth said will be joining the

394
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,000
security team at some point but for the

395
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,959
ones that don't we need to capture

396
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,079
uh their kind of security journey

397
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,040
um and we need to

398
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,839
to achieve that we need to take note of

399
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,920
the actions that they perform

400
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,519
for security

401
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,440
uh obviously those actions can be done

402
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,160
at various levels of maturity so this is

403
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,399
what this is about this is introducing

404
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,000
the categories

405
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,800
uh on on which security champions can

406
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,720
contribute

407
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,959
uh we as kind of associated it with

408
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,680
ostop then just to make it more familiar

409
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,480
to to people familiar to orasp

410
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,399
there are indeed 10 categories and i

411
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,399
will go through them uh right now

412
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,880
these are the categories

413
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,360
um you see maturity levels one two and

414
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,120
three and there is a later slide which

415
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,320
will be effectively detailing

416
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,760
each of the activities that can be

417
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,839
performed against against these

418
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,720
categories i will go go briefly through

419
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,440
the categories themselves

420
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,959
the first one is the use of tools

421
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,880
most of most security champions when

422
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
they start

423
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,680
maybe before they even become champions

424
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,360
they start playing around with security

425
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,839
tools uh most of them maybe start with

426
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,360
oasp zap

427
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,120
then they potentially

428
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,480
look at static code analysis tools

429
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,120
now dependency checking is much more

430
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,320
available to various solutions out there

431
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,240
through github through snake through

432
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,720
dependency checker of course the tawasp

433
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
um so the first category is pretty

434
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,000
straightforward and by the way this

435
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,079
doesn't apply only to developer security

436
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,079
champions it applies to

437
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,320
um security champions from other fields

438
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,240
from devops from all pure ops uh maybe

439
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,639
even desktop support security champions

440
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,920
so really it's the use of security tools

441
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,399
um and a later slide will explain the

442
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,480
levels the maturity levels

443
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,800
bounty refers to as you might suspect

444
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,360
about bounties

445
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,040
security champions can contribute in

446
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,480
various ways

447
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,959
they can perform the triage

448
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,480
obviously they will be involved in

449
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,199
fixing the issues

450
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,360
they could even manage a a smaller bug

451
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,600
bounty challenge so there are various

452
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,320
ways in which uh security champions can

453
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
contribute to bug bounties and this is

454
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,959
what this category is about

455
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,759
training is is a very very

456
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,440
straightforward this one

457
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,519
uh most of the security champions

458
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,639
initiatives out there propose training

459
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,759
um

460
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,680
to security champions and this can be

461
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,519
done at various levels

462
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,959
um and

463
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,439
uh this is what the maturity levels for

464
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,000
this category will be about depending on

465
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,799
the difficulty of the training

466
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,000
um

467
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,079
the champions will be considered more or

468
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,319
less mature

469
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,119
events this refers to attending or

470
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,720
presenting

471
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,520
or even organizing events

472
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,720
um we have examples such as gareth

473
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,840
which they they have organized events uh

474
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
locally and globally

475
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,000
in in sage internally and externally

476
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,240
champions that have presented at all asp

477
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,720
and at other conferences

478
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,600
so

479
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,919
their contribution to events also needs

480
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,960
to be taken into consideration i believe

481
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,919
um

482
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,720
uh security operations security ops uh

483
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,640
we had champions and this was actually

484
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,320
very much recommended by one of our

485
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,000
other lead security champions dave he

486
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,400
um insisted that champions can

487
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,640
contribute to osit

488
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,520
um

489
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
and and luckily they actually found a

490
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,039
few things hanging out there on the

491
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,280
internet which should not be there

492
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,200
um obviously there are many other ways

493
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,240
in which

494
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,640
a security champion can contribute to to

495
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,320
security operations

496
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,840
uh and this much this maturity category

497
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,720
i very much admit can or should receive

498
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,559
much more love than he has

499
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,640
uh i'm we are very much open to

500
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,960
contributions for for this for this

501
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,640
particular category

502
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,320
security reviews and assessments this

503
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,160
can be of any flavor

504
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,320
um it's important uh to to capture these

505
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,520
uh

506
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,720
very important i would say maybe it's

507
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,480
one of the most important categories

508
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,160
security champions that can't produce

509
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,679
security reviews themselves uh are super

510
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,240
useful i think to any company

511
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,520
uh they obviously are able to analyze

512
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,960
the the the application with uh

513
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,840
very different lenses to a

514
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
to a penetration tester which

515
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,760
theoretically doesn't know much about

516
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,440
the application

517
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,240
or knows only what was what he or she

518
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,200
was introduced to

519
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,840
research uh this

520
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,799
exactly as the category name suggests

521
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,679
uh

522
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,520
revolves around performing research in

523
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,880
in the context of information security

524
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
they could be

525
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,039
researching for an alternative fix to an

526
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,120
issue they could be researching for

527
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,240
innovative issues zero days

528
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,039
anything or obviously it has to go into

529
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,440
design potentially as well so any sort

530
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,120
of design patterns

531
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,280
uh specific to security that could be

532
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,480
elaborated

533
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,799
uh go into into this category which

534
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,320
actually links

535
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,960
very closely with the next one

536
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,679
which is development for security um

537
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,480
they could be developing tools

538
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,880
to be used by the security team or by

539
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,039
themselves there are now automated

540
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,360
pipelines for a few years

541
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,480
which

542
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,720
which use developer or security

543
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,000
champions develop develop tools

544
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,760
for automated security testing for

545
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,520
example

546
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
this activity

547
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,559
would be captured against this category

548
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,280
reporting i i added this one because

549
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,480
i think uh reporting is important to

550
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,400
to everyone out there

551
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,840
you need to show

552
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,039
the leadership of your business

553
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,039
what you're doing you need you need to

554
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,600
to to demonstrate

555
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,799
um you know progress to uh against your

556
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,840
strategy

557
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,679
uh you need to show that the stats are

558
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,440
going in the right direction

559
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,840
and i guess in a in a security champion

560
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,240
developer world it's important to show

561
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,320
that remediation is happening

562
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,559
uh as as soon as uh it is necessary

563
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,640
um for example in stage you need to fix

564
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,919
a critical issue in two days

565
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:02,720
and

566
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,320
it's important to show that we have

567
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,880
actually done that

568
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,600
and this is what this point is about

569
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,959
finally threat modeling

570
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,320
obviously

571
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,000
it refers to design and the contribution

572
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,400
of developers to security and privacy by

573
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,720
design this can also be done at various

574
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,039
maturity levels

575
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,159
you can

576
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,240
or you can participate in a threat model

577
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,720
you can organize the threat model uh you

578
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,600
can document the threat model properly

579
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,120
this

580
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,159
again

581
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,120
will

582
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,760
be associated with different maturity

583
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,679
levels for this category

584
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,880
now

585
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
you were wondering how do we capture all

586
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,640
of these things

587
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,679
um

588
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,520
and uh

589
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,200
and it is true and up

590
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,000
uh there is an excel version currently

591
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,919
available until we make the the app

592
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,320
itself available which would be

593
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,159
relatively soon i hope by the end of

594
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,760
october we would be able to make this

595
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,280
public

596
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,799
and unless in the in the meantime there

597
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,640
is an excel version available

598
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,080
on screen now it is the the actual app

599
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
uh which shows the profile of the

600
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,720
security champion shows the belt

601
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,360
that the the belt color that the

602
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,520
the champion has achieved

603
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,240
uh it shows the rank on the on the kind

604
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,520
of the security champions leaderboard

605
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,760
all of these activities what i which

606
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,880
i've mentioned earlier they all

607
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,880
receive one two or three points

608
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,120
this is kind of the suggested

609
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,840
a way of keeping track of things these

610
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,919
two points

611
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,120
and

612
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,640
as you can see on screen it shows the

613
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,240
rank it shows that

614
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,400
as i said the color of the belt and the

615
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,159
maturity level you can share an

616
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,679
achievement you can comment on an

617
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,880
achievement

618
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,799
uh innovators you can obviously log

619
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,360
achievements as you can see on screen

620
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,159
this is meant to be available to

621
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,480
everyone uh including known champions so

622
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,240
they can have a look and see

623
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,159
uh you know who's who's in the first

624
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,320
place what have they done

625
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,240
uh maybe they can contribute to don't

626
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
really need to be as an official

627
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,600
officially a security champion to to uh

628
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,159
to be taken into consideration any

629
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,520
security activity performed by anyone

630
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,320
should be able to find its way to

631
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,400
to this to this app that we will be

632
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,080
introducing

633
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,880
um

634
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,679
we

635
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,120
uh we will be introducing this up uh

636
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,840
with with an api attached to it so if

637
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,679
you will need to

638
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,679
uh hook it up to

639
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,000
any other system uh that you're using to

640
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,760
keep track of things that's that should

641
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,520
be very much possible

642
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,960
um it's important maybe for um let's

643
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,120
let's imagine uh there are a number of

644
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,360
vulnerabilities found for one of your

645
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,640
applications

646
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,960
uh it would be good to know

647
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,159
quickly if possible or in an automated

648
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,360
manner if the team

649
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,520
responsible for that product

650
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,720
um

651
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,480
has been trained

652
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,000
what have been tre have they been

653
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,480
trained against uh what sort of

654
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,720
performance they have

655
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,679
in regards to activities uh uh performed

656
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,200
for security

657
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,120
uh where do they stand

658
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,559
at that point in time when those

659
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,880
vulnerabilities have been identified

660
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,080
maybe they're not doing the right

661
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,120
training

662
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,279
maybe they're they're doing activities

663
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,159
for security but not in that area which

664
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,840
relates to the vulnerabilities that have

665
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,520
been identified

666
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,240
um so it's important to have a to have

667
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,000
some sort of connection between this

668
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,480
system and the vulnerability management

669
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,600
system so our intention is to link this

670
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
uh with our vulnerability management

671
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,039
system for uh for to to determine in a

672
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,840
in a in a better way what's going on in

673
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,760
a more precise way what's going on with

674
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,679
the security of um

675
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,400
of

676
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,919
our products

677
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,559
so this is the app uh we watch this

678
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,918
space the github

679
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,480
repo is is linked

680
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,640
in this slide um

681
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
the app will be made available

682
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,480
on the same on the same space as the

683
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,520
excel

684
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,000
on this this presentation

685
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,159
um in the next slides and the next two

686
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,080
slides um i have the detailed uh

687
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,360
bits

688
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,880
so

689
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
effectively each uh explaining each of

690
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,720
the maturity levels

691
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,679
uh for these categories that i've uh

692
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,559
i've defined earlier i i will not go

693
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,919
into detail

694
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,520
in this slide

695
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,799
i hope

696
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,120
it is straightforward for everyone the

697
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,200
excel is public and it allows people to

698
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,640
comment so please do contribute to it

699
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,120
and and let's make these categories more

700
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,640
more clear

701
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,559
if this eventually

702
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,640
will be pushing

703
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,760
um the um

704
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,400
kind of the application security sector

705
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
towards um

706
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,200
a world where devs do security by

707
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,880
default and we don't even need to call

708
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,960
them champions because

709
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,360
um they they already perform security

710
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,120
kind of by default

711
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,840
then

712
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,000
i hope it helps us to get there

713
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,559
but until we get there um

714
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,919
this project

715
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,080
uh as i was mentioning at the beginning

716
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,559
um we hope it can be associated with

717
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,960
maturity two and three

718
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,640
uh for for oasp sam and and bsim

719
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,799
maturity models

720
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,400
um

721
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,799
the the second slide with the detail is

722
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,559
the the excel that allows you to keep

723
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,520
track of things now this is this is uh

724
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,279
what the the the app that i showed

725
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,360
earlier will be doing

726
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,200
uh if you prefer to use excel if you

727
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,320
prefer to

728
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,799
import this excel or borrow this excel

729
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,039
to use it in a in your own app or in a

730
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,320
different app

731
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,039
that achieves the same things uh you are

732
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,480
you are very much free to do so

733
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,240
there are two things i i just want to

734
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,080
mention is there are two things that are

735
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,440
important to

736
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,480
um

737
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,640
that this excel is achieving one is it

738
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,799
is um keeping track of your belt color

739
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,559
which would be renewing on an annual

740
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,600
basis

741
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,080
uh i'm anticipating this as a question

742
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
do you reset this or where does this go

743
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,559
forever our recommendation is that this

744
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,640
gets reset at every six months or one

745
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,919
year

746
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,279
whereas the leaderboard could

747
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,640
potentially continue beyond that here

748
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,200
um because as i was mentioning at some

749
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,440
point some of these security champions

750
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,440
will join the security team

751
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,159
i think it is it is good to see

752
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,880
canada whole journey uh since they've

753
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,399
become champions

754
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,640
um their whole security journey of kind

755
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,000
of helping the security team

756
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,600
um

757
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
and finally i want to kind of end with

758
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,919
why we're doing this

759
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,720
and it is to support security champions

760
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,919
we've we've realized in sage that um

761
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,520
recognition

762
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,080
um and rewarding

763
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,200
uh

764
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,919
whilst it might happen here and there it

765
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,399
wasn't organized properly some people

766
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,360
were

767
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,440
not recognized when they should have

768
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,840
been they were recognized much later or

769
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,120
not at all

770
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,880
um

771
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,039
things were not visible

772
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,279
to to the security team

773
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,039
uh and they were not visible to their

774
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,880
managers properly uh it will it will

775
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,399
it will offer

776
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,159
an exact

777
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,360
view of

778
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,440
uh what are what are these champions

779
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,600
really spending their time on and as you

780
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,360
can see one of these one of the points

781
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,960
on the slide says that uh this project

782
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,799
will help security champions fulfill

783
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,039
their objectives towards contributing

784
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,279
with how much percent

785
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,279
of their time to security now in sage it

786
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,120
is ten percent

787
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,240
uh but obviously depending on the uh on

788
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,320
on your business depending on the

789
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,399
experience of the champion depending on

790
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,320
the dimension of your security team as

791
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,080
gareth was was mentioning

792
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,480
in in the statistics slide earlier

793
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,120
the uh the kind of the ratio of security

794
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,039
champions to security team um is is uh

795
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,880
one to four

796
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,919
it will be one security person and and

797
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,720
four security champions associated with

798
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,720
uh with a security uh professional um

799
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,320
how much time do they need to to

800
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,080
dedicate um

801
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,799
again ten percent is is our

802
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,360
uh is our recommendation but it is it is

803
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,440
up to you to determine that

804
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,159
uh hopefully this this project can help

805
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,760
could help determining that as well

806
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,320
because some some some uh security

807
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
champions and stage have trouble

808
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,760
identifying how much time they've

809
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,039
actually spent

810
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,720
they they have trouble keeping track

811
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,000
themselves

812
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
on on the many things that if they have

813
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,399
done uh towards helping the security

814
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,919
team really it's a it's a way to scale

815
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:06,799
um

816
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,520
and and and this app is a way to manage

817
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,520
this the scaling

818
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,279
um

819
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,720
some champions don't know how to

820
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,640
contribute to security this will help

821
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,399
them achieve that

822
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,960
uh they will grow because they will know

823
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,480
what to do to grow

824
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,000
uh they will be recognized everywhere

825
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
that i already mentioned that they will

826
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,320
keep track of their progress

827
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,480
um and i don't want to go through all of

828
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,200
them

829
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,520
uh but if i i'd lastly i want to mention

830
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,480
is is building a capability

831
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,600
we don't want security champions

832
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,080
to kind of stay flat we want them to

833
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,919
grow and we want to build that

834
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,880
capability maybe for certain products

835
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,080
they could take

836
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,480
the the control the full control of

837
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,320
security themselves so they don't need

838
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,880
to rely on the security team at all

839
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,279
really maybe just for advice uh now and

840
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,399
then

841
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,440
um

842
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,840
and uh once they have received this

843
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,200
advice for a few years they have

844
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,760
contributed to security uh for some time

845
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,279
and they have proven

846
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,320
their their their expertise

847
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,000
they can join the security team and some

848
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,519
of them have

849
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,200
in sage

850
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,320
and i'm sure many more will

851
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,720
um i think this is this is this was my

852
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,799
part this is what i wanted to

853
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,559
to um to to detail in this presentation

854
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,200
um i hope it was enough to convince you

855
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,399
that

856
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,159
this tool is needed

857
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,440
that it was

858
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,799
a gap

859
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,840
um

860
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,640
