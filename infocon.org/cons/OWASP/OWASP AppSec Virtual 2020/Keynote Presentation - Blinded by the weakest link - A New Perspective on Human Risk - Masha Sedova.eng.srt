i'm so excited to be talking to you

58
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,600
about a new perspective on human risk

59
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,360
how we insecurity

60
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,880
have been blinded by the weakest link

61
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,160
before we get started i would like to

62
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,759
just tell you a little bit about how i

63
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,240
got here today and i'm so excited to be

64
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,600
talking to you about this particular

65
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,720
subject

66
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,800
so i've been in the security

67
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
space for over 16 years started my

68
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,960
career initially

69
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,680
working for the dod

70
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,120
and focusing on russian apts

71
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,280
and in that capacity i became really

72
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,800
fascinated with the human element and

73
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,360
came to believe that security was people

74
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
attacking people with a whole bunch of

75
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
technology in the middle

76
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,599
that love and interest and passion took

77
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,720
me to salesforce where i got to start

78
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,479
and run a team

79
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,120
focused on the full spectrum of the

80
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,440
human element and human risk

81
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,080
and for five years got to help people

82
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,440
tackle things like phishing and

83
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,759
tailgating all the way through secure

84
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,680
coding practices and security feature

85
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,199
adoption

86
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,560
ultimately

87
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,160
my love of the human factor in security

88
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,759
took me to starting my own company

89
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,759
elevate security which i'm the

90
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,639
co-founder of and today elevate security

91
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,599
is the leading platform that helps

92
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,960
companies

93
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,840
measure and influence human risk in

94
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,000
their organization

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,560
throughout my career i have been

96
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,039
really focused on the question of how do

97
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,120
we get people to want to do security

98
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,960
instead of just have to

99
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,720
and that question has took me to the

100
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,120
field of behavioral science and positive

101
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,560
psychology

102
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,759
all of which

103
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,000
i've been working into

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,319
my work as a security practitioner and

105
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,919
helping

106
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,319
organizations across the world

107
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,560
start thinking about human risk in a

108
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,960
totally different light

109
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,440
and so with that i wanted to start by

110
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,120
sharing one of the realizations i've

111
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,879
come throughout my country throughout my

112
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,400
career and that is that human risk is

113
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,639
one of the largest unsolved problems in

114
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,160
security

115
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,479
it's also one of the largest unexplored

116
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,319
areas in security

117
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,720
and the reason that i believe this is

118
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,919
because

119
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,520
if you open up the verizon data breach

120
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,440
report this year

121
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,560
you'll see

122
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,280
that the top reasons for tax and

123
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,799
successful incidents in this last year

124
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,440
are those that you see in front of you

125
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,519
now if i were to ask you

126
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,760
if any of these came a surprise

127
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,159
you'd likely tell me no because these

128
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,440
are the same

129
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
reasons attackers have been getting into

130
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,720
our organizations for at least a decade

131
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,080
and so as thoughtful security

132
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
practitioners we've invested in all of

133
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,800
these technologies that help us

134
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,320
mitigate and detect and

135
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,000
respond from

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,080
these type of vulnerabilities and yet

137
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,000
they are still the ones we're tackling

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,440
year after year

139
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,360
and why is that

140
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
it's because there is

141
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,920
a human component that we have failed to

142
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,839
address in every one of these attack

143
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,120
vectors

144
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,480
the human element or human risk

145
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,519
is the soft underbelly of security

146
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,800
and without looking into it closely and

147
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,040
thoughtfully it will continue to thwart

148
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,800
us in our efforts to defend our

149
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,120
organizations

150
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,160
now the reason this ex

151
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,680
this weakness exists could be

152
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,959
one option and that employees are users

153
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,040
are done they're the weakest link and

154
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,880
they're always going to make mistakes

155
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,959
and frankly this is the

156
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,360
approach that we have been thinking of

157
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,480
about the end user for quite a long time

158
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
in fact we don't even call them

159
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,399
employees or the workforce we call them

160
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,000
again end users and uh have

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,959
not been attributing very kind thoughts

162
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,959
around them things calling them things

163
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,440
like what where or the problem exists

164
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
between the keyboard and the chair or

165
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,480
the weakest link

166
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,000
and so

167
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,320
it's been really comfortable for us to

168
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,200
say

169
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,399
oh well

170
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,640
employees are just the weakest link in

171
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,160
the system they're dumb they're always

172
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
going to be dumb let's just throw

173
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,320
technology at this problem

174
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
there's a different approach and a

175
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,279
different philosophy and that

176
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,959
is that it is not the employee's fault

177
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,320
but it is our inability as security

178
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,600
practitioners to meet them where they

179
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,720
are at

180
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,920
and instead of using the weakest link as

181
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,519
an excuse

182
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,640
for the standard status quo

183
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,800
it should in fact be a rallying cry for

184
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,160
us to meet this very challenging problem

185
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,680
head on

186
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,160
and with the resources it deserves

187
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,440
because the our inability to do that is

188
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,880
going to continue to thwart our ability

189
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,600
to effectively secure our organizations

190
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,200
now we have spent

191
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,360
a lot of resources

192
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,959
evolving our security tech stacks and

193
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:17,760
over

194
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,640
over decades we have done an amazing job

195
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,000
at evolving our technologies and helping

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,839
our

197
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,360
organizations evolve

198
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,040
but the human operating system has had

199
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
very little progress

200
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,240
from what we were doing back in 2002 to

201
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,399
what are we doing today

202
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,680
in fact

203
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,000
if i were to again ask you to raise your

204
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,440
hand if you've ever gone through an

205
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,079
annual security training in your company

206
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,640
that you have muted skipped to the end

207
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,399
and guessed the quiz question

208
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,800
i would guess a hundred percent of

209
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,240
everyone listening and watching this

210
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,040
right now would raise their hand

211
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,079
this is the same approach we have done

212
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,040
year

213
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
after year

214
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,079
and hoping that we are going to somehow

215
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,760
solve this problem in our organizations

216
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,279
this particular approach of using the

217
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,360
annual security training

218
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,399
is really driven by a compliance mandate

219
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,800
it's done as one size fits all and its

220
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,320
impact is

221
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,560
very hard to measure arguably there's

222
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,800
very little impact to measure

223
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,880
and so if we continue to use this

224
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,959
approach time and time again

225
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,880
we're going to

226
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,279
reinforce what albert einstein used as a

227
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,120
definition of insanity

228
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,440
which is expecting a different result

229
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,839
from the same old approach

230
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,160
and so what i would like to do

231
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,040
in this talk is explain

232
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,720
and walk you through

233
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
that how human risk

234
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,760
is a critical and foundational piece of

235
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,360
security that has not had the attention

236
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,200
it deserves to date

237
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,920
and show you how it affects every aspect

238
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,079
of security no matter what role you hold

239
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,440
in today

240
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,959
i'd like to

241
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,360
explain to you how you as a security

242
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,800
practitioner

243
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,440
are a stakeholder in this conversation

244
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,279
and provide an alternative framework

245
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,040
that can help you understand how to

246
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,680
measure and influence human risk in

247
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,760
whatever organizations you work for

248
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,959
today

249
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,320
so let's get started

250
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,120
i've used this term a couple of times

251
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,800
uh human risk

252
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,560
what do i mean by that

253
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,600
what what does uh what do these two two

254
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
words uh stand for

255
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,519
so first and foremost let's talk about

256
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,199
what it is not

257
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,720
so you may work for an organization

258
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,000
that

259
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,360
already

260
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,320
has security practitioners uh working

261
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
security awareness practitioners and

262
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,000
those folks are responsible for

263
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,920
potentially rolling out training

264
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,199
but security awareness is not

265
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,519
the same thing as understanding human

266
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,399
risk and let me explain why

267
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,560
uh the difference

268
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,399
uh the thing that security awareness

269
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,760
focuses on

270
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,880
is knowledge it focuses on the idea that

271
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,839
if our if we just tell our

272
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,880
employees that

273
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,639
about more information around security

274
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,160
and security best practices they're

275
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,000
going to change their behaviors

276
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,480
and that in fact is not

277
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,199
what we have seen time and time again

278
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,560
lastpass did a great study of their

279
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,040
users and found that despite a huge

280
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,440
portion of their population knowing what

281
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,600
good security practices look like

282
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,680
many of them continue to exhibit poor

283
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,279
password habits

284
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,959
similarly if any of us knew about

285
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,079
uh

286
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,480
if if knowledge was enough all of

287
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
all the smokers in the world

288
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,839
would heed the

289
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,320
smoking kills package

290
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,160
awareness on the cigarette packages and

291
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,880
not smoke but what we understand is that

292
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
awareness is not the same thing as

293
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,959
action and what people do is so much

294
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,320
more important

295
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,639
than what people know

296
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,040
and if any of us have worked for

297
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,199
organizations with very

298
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,519
independent-minded employees and i would

299
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,760
argue this exists in almost every

300
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,399
organization we find that the best-laid

301
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,839
policies and the best-laid

302
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,279
um advice

303
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,759
will always be circumvented by the

304
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,720
actions our employees think that they

305
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,320
should be taking

306
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,519
and so

307
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,639
again

308
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,279
measuring how much our employees know

309
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,279
and their quiz questions

310
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,240
and how committed they are to security

311
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,399
isn't enough

312
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,839
human risk

313
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,440
is is the study of going beyond that and

314
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,800
understanding what our employees

315
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,240
actually do now human risk isn't just

316
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,120
bad behaviors and the introduction of

317
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,759
negative actions it is the combination

318
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,320
an understanding of all of the decisions

319
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,920
that employees make on our in our

320
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,519
environments both good

321
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,639
and bad

322
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,199
the combination of which that i can

323
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,920
either reduce our exposure to incidents

324
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,720
or help

325
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,480
accelerate it

326
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,199
now

327
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,839
you might be thinking well we already

328
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,279
measure human risk as it relates to

329
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,040
phishing we have an understanding of how

330
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
well people are related to

331
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
people are in detecting

332
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,360
efficient compromise rates but there are

333
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,399
so many other factors that go into the

334
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,600
security decisions our employees make on

335
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,480
the networks of our environments and our

336
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
with our technologies and our source

337
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,880
code

338
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,079
and

339
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,560
this wheel is just a sampling of what

340
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,440
many of the factors that on a daily

341
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,480
basis

342
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,279
our workforces are asked to

343
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,240
think about and make decisions on as

344
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
related to security and every one of

345
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,880
these points is an area where an

346
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,240
employee can make

347
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,679
a good dis security decision or a poor

348
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,199
security decision

349
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,520
all of which are helping

350
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,880
uh

351
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,439
our security posture or hurting it as

352
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,359
you can see some of these

353
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,079
are

354
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,280
preventative and in choosing to do so

355
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,640
can help my

356
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,760
uh organization uh be more secure so i

357
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,480
can apply my patching fa and my machine

358
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,440
faster i can turn on 2fa proactively i

359
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,919
can use password managers i can be

360
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,919
thoughtful about how i should handle my

361
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,880
data

362
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,360
i can also be much better at detecting

363
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
when things come at me like malware and

364
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,320
phishing

365
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,400
tailgating incidents or if i'm

366
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,919
navigating to a site that looks

367
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,720
suspicious all of which can help

368
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,160
understand

369
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,840
help help the security team understand

370
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,600
if i am

371
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,520
a good or bad

372
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,799
minded

373
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,240
security individual

374
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,559
so i wanted to

375
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,120
share this in a story to paint this

376
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,520
picture a little bit more clearly

377
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,960
and i want to tell you the story about

378
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,080
clara

379
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,880
so

380
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,679
clara is a developer and she needs to

381
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,280
she's working on a piece of code that's

382
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,039
getting shipped

383
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,240
and

384
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,640
she has 10 days worth of work to do that

385
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,840
includes

386
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,559
security reviews but she only has seven

387
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,400
days in her uh in a work day in in her

388
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,000
allotted work time to be able to ship

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,160
this code on time

390
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,919
so what is she going to do

391
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,240
is she going to ship this code

392
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,440
on time but without the security testing

393
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,919
or is she going to ship it late

394
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,200
and securely now

395
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,679
in this case security is an opposing

396
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,600
force to all of the other business

397
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
pressure pressures that are uh pushing

398
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,720
down on her

399
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,400
whether or not she's going to meet her

400
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,080
deadline how

401
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
her boss is going to

402
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,200
either reprimand or support her

403
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
how her bonus is affected based on all

404
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,559
these decisions

405
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,360
but in this moment clara has the

406
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,679
opportunity to make a security decision

407
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,280
of whether or not she's going to

408
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,400
thoroughly test her code for security

409
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,320
and

410
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,720
if she works for an organization that

411
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,799
supports good security decision making

412
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,520
and thoughtful about reducing human risk

413
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,440
she will choose a decision

414
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,240
that will be pro-secured

415
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,120
and will push push the code later uh

416
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,039
later but securely but let's say she

417
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,160
works for an organization where

418
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,559
the deadline and the bonus is tied to

419
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,280
timely releases

420
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,360
what will end up happening

421
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,559
maybe

422
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,960
nothing at all maybe she ships this code

423
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,280
and no breaches or incidents happen and

424
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,200
maybe nobody finds this particular

425
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,840
vulnerability and life goes on but

426
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,600
what's happened

427
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,799
is that in this situation

428
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,960
claire has introduced just a small

429
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,799
amount of security debt in her

430
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,480
organization

431
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,679
and

432
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,760
that security debt as you can see on the

433
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,520
screen is the

434
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,159
yellow triangle starts building over

435
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,200
time

436
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,440
in all of the organization with all the

437
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,120
claire's happening

438
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,400
every time a decision like this is made

439
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,559
then we are adding

440
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,799
towards the security failure up until

441
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,559
the point the security debt of the

442
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,520
organization is so great that it results

443
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,960
in a breach

444
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,000
so by no means has any one risky

445
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
decision at one point

446
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,400
lead to a headline but it is the

447
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,360
aggregate of the debt and the aggregate

448
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,039
of these decisions that increase the

449
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,559
probability towards security failure

450
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,520
now the example of clara is not the only

451
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,039
place that security risk the the human

452
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,679
risk exists for organization in fact it

453
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,320
touches every element of the modern

454
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,799
cyber security tech stack no matter what

455
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,039
part of security you work in

456
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,000
there's a human being who is responsible

457
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,720
for making thoughtful security decisions

458
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,320
associated

459
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,039
with the security protocols that we set

460
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,000
out

461
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,559
if i am i have access to infrastructure

462
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,039
as code and i'm setting up settings i

463
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,960
need to make thoughtful decisions about

464
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,400
permissioning

465
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,520
if i

466
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,360
am adjusting firewall rules and i am in

467
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,120
charge and have some amount of change

468
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,039
management that i'm responsible for what

469
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,880
kind of approvals and threat modeling

470
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,320
have i done

471
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,000
for these types of uh white listing of

472
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,919
of accounts for example

473
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:42,799
and so

474
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,840
these decisions touch our code

475
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,000
our infrastructure

476
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,360
our tech stacks on an ongoing basis and

477
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,520
regularly so the debt that we think

478
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,400
about

479
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,880
gets added on to every one of these

480
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,440
categories

481
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,919
and eventually build up over time

482
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,600
and so

483
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,159
it doesn't really matter

484
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,320
what part of security you're in because

485
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,000
human risk

486
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,799
introduces these vulnerabilities when

487
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,400
they are ignored uh and and decided

488
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,200
poorly and so we can see that

489
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,679
if you're an infra engineering aws

490
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,600
buckets uh

491
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,200
get leaked quite quite frequently uh

492
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,520
these days product security coding

493
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,240
errors and code gets that's unshit

494
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,600
untested gets shipped access management

495
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,840
with stolen credentials

496
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,280
if you're in charge of privacy and

497
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,760
access control to to sensitive data

498
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,039
handling and

499
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,720
and careless decision making by

500
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,919
employees

501
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,400
unpatched vulnerabilities if you are

502
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
work if you work in enterprise security

503
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,720
and if you're an incident response then

504
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,960
you're cleaning up all of these

505
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,159
decisions

506
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,440
all of these mistakes and pain points

507
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,200
that have been introduced in your

508
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,880
organization

509
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,840
now

510
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,400
when it goes well it looks totally

511
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,480
different and i don't have headlines for

512
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
you to show you what it looks like when

513
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,720
it goes well because this never makes

514
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,919
the news a well-run secure organization

515
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,840
is not going to the next headline of

516
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,000
wall street journal but what it looks

517
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,679
like is that

518
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,039
when you have human risk as part of your

519
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,919
integrated strategy in your security

520
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:28,720
team

521
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,799
for incident response the metrics you're

522
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,039
held accountable to like the number of

523
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,320
incidents

524
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
will start going down because there's

525
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,240
less uh

526
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
less vulnerabilities to clean up less

527
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,480
mistakes happening and your time to

528
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
close starts improving

529
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,720
if you're in compliance your audit

530
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
findings reduce and as people are

531
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,279
leaning more into

532
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,919
following compliance rules if you're in

533
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,760
enterprise security

534
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,080
uh it's it's thoughtful adoption of

535
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,120
patching metrics or vpn usage or even

536
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,480
the use of

537
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,120
mfa across your organization

538
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,600
if you're in product security the number

539
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,919
of bugs you find in code how fast those

540
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,200
bugs are fixed and how frequently you

541
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,039
have releases that are secure on the

542
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,400
first round

543
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,840
and if you're in in on a red team your

544
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,159
life actually becomes harder and

545
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,240
that's great because you're going to

546
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,679
find that more people um are resilient

547
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,000
to attacks reporting more

548
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,520
and

549
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,640
are

550
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,559
are introducing less vulnerabilities

551
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,799
into their organization

552
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,279
and on a final note on this particular

553
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,880
section

554
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,039
the the addressing human risk in our

555
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,000
organization is not a silver bullet but

556
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,960
it is a key layer of defense

557
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,320
and what

558
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,080
what you see right now on the screen is

559
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,480
my favorite model of risk which is swiss

560
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,600
cheese

561
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,440
and really anything related to cheese is

562
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,679
delightful but in the swiss cheese model

563
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,880
of risk we see that everything is a

564
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,039
layer that helps defend our

565
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,400
organizations in some but no one layer

566
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,600
is perfect

567
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,880
so that when a hazard gets through one

568
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,640
layer like in engineer control there are

569
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,880
subsequent layers that can help catch us

570
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,120
and so behavioral controls which is what

571
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,000
we've been talking about the human risk

572
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,679
and the decisions our employees make in

573
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,279
an organization

574
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,120
are a key factor

575
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,720
that help reinforce the other elements

576
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,039
that we have in our organization both

577
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,120
the engineering controls the process

578
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,960
controls we have in place that should

579
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,559
all work together

580
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,480
to help make our organizations more

581
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,600
secure

582
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,159
by choosing to just

583
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,640
think about behavioral controls as a

584
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,559
compliance exercise where we check the

585
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,840
box

586
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,720
we fail to add a full layer

587
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,200
of defense in our organizations in the

588
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,760
way and help defend them in the way that

589
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,240
they really can be defended

590
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,120
so

591
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,760
hopefully uh we're all we're all on

592
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
board on the idea that

593
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
each one of our jobs and security no

594
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,559
matter what role you have is directly

595
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,320
impacted

596
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,279
by

597
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,320
the the human element and the type of

598
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
decisions that our employees make in our

599
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,840
organization

600
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,880
so

601
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,559
how now that we realize we're all

602
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,640
stakeholders how do we actually affect

603
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,600
change

604
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,080
what is your role

605
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,640
in in doing all of this

606
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,679
well first i'd like to acknowledge that

607
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,080
the human element is not

608
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,880
a programmable os

609
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,919
as we called it earlier and has many

610
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,919
layers to it and so we can't solve this

611
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,880
problem from the same

612
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,120
space as we solve most of our other

613
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,400
security problems

614
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,600
human beings are messy and dynamic and

615
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,880
complex

616
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,960
and so the things that we need to be

617
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,320
applying here

618
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,440
are actually tools outside of security

619
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,760
to help tackle this problem in my

620
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,919
decade plus of looking at this problem

621
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,000
space i found that three particular

622
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,520
areas of study

623
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,559
have been really valuable in

624
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,840
addressing

625
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,240
this risk one is data analytics which

626
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,559
will help us measure this problem

627
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,559
the last two are psychology and

628
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,240
behavioral science which can help us

629
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,360
understand

630
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,440
how and why employees are making these

631
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,679
decisions that they are and how we can

632
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,600
influence it so i'm going to walk

633
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,679
through

634
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,320
in two sections

635
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,720
a couple of ideas and frameworks that

636
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,279
might empower you to be able to

637
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,000
gain visibility and influence this

638
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,919
particular problem so let's start with

639
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,080
the first part of this question which is

640
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,480
how do we measure human risk

641
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,919
measuring this isn't really important

642
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,480
because we can't change what we can't

643
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,440
see

644
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,679
so how do we understand the level of

645
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,000
human risk in our organization what do

646
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,399
we need to do about it

647
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,760
so

648
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,919
when we think about the the security

649
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,440
actions that

650
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,600
that our employees in our workforce take

651
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,360
in our organization it's because of two

652
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,240
major categories of

653
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,919
concepts the first

654
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,520
is everything above the iceberg and

655
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,360
these are the observable behaviors the

656
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
decisions that we choose to do

657
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,399
and then everything below the iceberg is

658
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,880
what we believe why we do the things we

659
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,760
do

660
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,840
now we're going to walk through ways of

661
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,120
measuring both of these at scale

662
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,240
and i want to walk you through

663
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,039
specifically some examples the first is

664
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,440
observable behaviors so what i mean by

665
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,159
that is when an employee clicks on a

666
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,799
phishing link or if they're reporting an

667
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,440
attack or using a password manager all

668
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,279
of these are the things that have

669
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,520
metrics associated and we can see if it

670
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,440
is going up or down

671
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,240
now underneath it the reason i would do

672
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,240
one of these observable behaviors is

673
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,760
because

674
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,520
i have a belief

675
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,240
that security is part of my job that i

676
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,880
am a target or i am not a target or i

677
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,480
have valuable information to protect if

678
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,159
i don't believe that i have valuable

679
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,760
information to protect

680
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,240
then i am much more likely to click on a

681
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,000
phishing link if i don't think i'm a

682
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,559
target then who cares if i use a

683
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,279
password manager now the reason i would

684
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,919
hold these beliefs and values are

685
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,679
because of assumptions that i've had in

686
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,120
my life

687
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,520
do i think a breach can happen to me do

688
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,559
i think

689
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,720
that security

690
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,559
belongs in some other

691
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,600
department and i may not be

692
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,200
capable of

693
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,760
tackling these kinds of

694
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,039
problem sets

695
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,480
and

696
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,440
all of this is underneath the foundation

697
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,320
of the experiences i've had in my life

698
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,039
and if i have ever been through a breach

699
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,640
in my life

700
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,039
i am much more likely to believe that a

701
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,960
breach can happen to me

702
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
and i'm much more likely to believe that

703
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,120
i am a target and securities part of my

704
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,840
job and i am much more likely

705
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,600
to be careful about clicking on phishing

706
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,679
links reporting attack

707
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,919
attacks being thoughtful about how i

708
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,480
handle my source code or being very

709
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,559
careful about how i set up

710
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,440
my

711
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,520
controls and permissions

712
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,960
now if i

713
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,799
do not have i've never experienced a

714
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,720
breach or never been part of a red team

715
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,399
where it has given me these types of

716
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,799
data sets everything built on top of

717
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,120
that is

718
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,640
it is much more questionable

719
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,240
so that's why it's really important to

720
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,480
measure the two two of these

721
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,000
the observable behaviors are actually

722
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,679
where the risk gets introduced it's

723
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,240
where the rubber meets the road and

724
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,360
where vulnerabilities happen or defense

725
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,120
happens in our organization but the

726
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,200
bottom part is the y

727
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,320
so let's focus on the above the iceberg

728
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,480
part first

729
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,360
so

730
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,200
we all know

731
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,240
in that in our organization

732
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,240
there are some employees that make risky

733
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,039
decisions sometimes there are also some

734
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,799
employees that make really great

735
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,279
decisions

736
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,080
can we answer today effectively

737
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,720
which employees are which what decisions

738
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,279
they're making and how often

739
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,640
the reason we have

740
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,600
one-size-fits-all security trainings

741
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,880
today is because very rarely

742
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,440
can organizations answer this very

743
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,919
critical and fundamental question

744
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,919
we can do this we can answer questions

745
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,600
like this for our technology stacks we

746
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,120
can say which of our computers are

747
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,559
patched

748
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,480
and we talk about asset management and

749
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,840
understanding what's going on in your

750
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,120
organization

751
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,640
we do not have the same rigor around our

752
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,240
employee base

753
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,080
so let's talk about how we can answer

754
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,760
this really core fundamental question

755
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,480
so

756
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,000
the first

757
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,919
thing that's important to realize is

758
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,000
that past predictors

759
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,279
are one of the best indicators uh the

760
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,440
one of the past actions are in the best

761
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,960
indicators of future actions in fact a

762
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,360
study done in 2015 by dr caputo

763
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,279
called going spearfishing

764
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,000
showed that in three targeted

765
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,840
spearfishing attacks

766
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,080
that have happened that were sent to a

767
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,200
population of 1500 employees

768
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,360
employees were likely to either click on

769
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,480
all of them or none of them and how you

770
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,320
performed on the very first spear

771
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,960
phishing attack that you

772
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,320
received was a very high indicator of

773
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,240
how you were going to react to the next

774
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,080
sets of spear phishing attacks that you

775
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,679
were going to get

776
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,159
so with that in mind we can start

777
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,399
realizing that there are decisions that

778
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,799
employees are making in our environment

779
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,840
all the time that can help us understand

780
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,320
our level of exposure to this particular

781
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,600
problem set

782
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,880
so i want to take the example of

783
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,159
malware

784
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,360
so let's say we have two uh employees in

785
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,720
our organization

786
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,320
sue and joe

787
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
and they both receive

788
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,760
malware

789
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,480
that gets sent to them now sue

790
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,919
is more

791
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,480
is more security-minded than joe and she

792
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,240
immediately recognizes that she should

793
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,600
not be downloading and running

794
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,240
executables from unknown senders good

795
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,919
job too

796
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:32,880
and

797
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,120
doesn't click doesn't execute

798
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,640
deletes this

799
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,960
now joe really is intrigued by this

800
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
executable seems like something he

801
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,799
really wants to run so he tries to

802
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,799
download it he tries he downloads and

803
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,960
tries to execute it and

804
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,559
uh both jones who work for an

805
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,720
organization that has thoughtfully

806
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,480
installed endpoint protection on the

807
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
machines that detects that malware is

808
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,760
trying to be run and stops the execution

809
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,200
great

810
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,960
but usually this is the spot where we

811
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,640
even in our most

812
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,960
advanced states as security teams

813
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,679
stop we think about the incident as

814
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,639
having been prevented and so

815
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,879
the the day is done we're good

816
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,079
however

817
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,159
this particular

818
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,839
event it gets logged and is pure gold in

819
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,918
helping us understand

820
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,639
which employee exhibits

821
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,800
low malware risk and which employee

822
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,119
exhibits high malware risk

823
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,839
joe in this case is clearly

824
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,399
not certified to judge what what should

825
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,639
or shouldn't be executed and therefore

826
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,879
needs to have follow-up intervention and

827
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,199
course correction here it could be that

828
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,280
he might need training but it could be

829
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,199
that he needs more advanced policies and

830
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,440
controls or more dedicated

831
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,719
uh dedicated technology to help him

832
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,159
with malware

833
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,239
now endpoint protection is not the only

834
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,400
technology that can give us insight into

835
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,720
the risk in our organization

836
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,200
in fact so many of our technologies that

837
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,480
we have spent

838
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,720
millions of dollars on

839
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,599
help us map and understand the type of

840
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,040
decisions our employees are making today

841
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,079
and we can map things like sensitive

842
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,640
data handling password protection

843
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,480
internet browsing upfront and

844
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,800
device security all from

845
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,119
the tech stack we have in place

846
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,839
so

847
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,640
we as we we revisit the wheel that we

848
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,960
talked about earlier we can see that

849
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,560
every one of the

850
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,240
segments of human risk that we think

851
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,960
about actually ties to technology that

852
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,040
can give us the insights

853
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,560
that we need to understand intent

854
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,280
and

855
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,440
just to close the loop on this

856
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,599
the technologies that we have in place

857
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,560
can then help us understand

858
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,119
which individuals are stronger and

859
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,240
weaker and in what areas giving us a

860
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,079
really fine level of precision to

861
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,280
understand

862
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,119
how to course correct for this

863
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,000
particular risk

864
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,400
as many of you who have been insecure

865
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,200
for a while uh have are familiar with

866
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,400
this

867
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,200
the definition of risk

868
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,320
is

869
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,680
impact times likelihood of an event

870
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,040
and so if we extract that through human

871
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,359
risk similarly

872
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,400
we have these two components and now

873
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
likelihood is exactly what we just

874
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,440
talked about this user reputation

875
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,040
of an employee of how good or bad they

876
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,280
are at understanding and detecting

877
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,400
malware

878
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,640
and impac as an example

879
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,400
an impact is their role and access level

880
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,839
so if someone has very little access in

881
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,560
an organization but is very terrible at

882
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,720
detecting malware to keep the example

883
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,599
going

884
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,680
then

885
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,680
they might not be as a as a significant

886
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
edition of human risk specific factor of

887
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,920
human risk in my organization as someone

888
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,119
who has high level of access

889
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,000
and high level of user reputation

890
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,960
today much of our security work only

891
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,440
focuses on role and access level and

892
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,760
while that is an important component it

893
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,800
only focuses on half of this equation

894
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,400
which is impact

895
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,920
the other half

896
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,640
in is to understand likelihood and as we

897
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,920
just talked about

898
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,560
likelihood can be mapped

899
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,119
and tracked as a function of the

900
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,520
security logs you already have in your

901
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,800
environment

902
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,200
that can use past decisions as

903
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,359
predictors for future

904
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,800
so that is how we can understand and map

905
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,119
the level of human risk that observable

906
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,760
security action in our organization

907
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,400
now what about everything underneath the

908
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,440
iceberg how do we map beliefs values and

909
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,079
assumptions

910
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,760
so

911
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,640
this area of uh security has been

912
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,720
studied a little bit deeper than

913
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,320
measuring observable behavior so i'm

914
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,320
only going to touch about on this at a

915
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,880
pretty high level but one of the best

916
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,640
reports that i've found on this

917
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,359
particular space is a combination of two

918
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,119
sources the first

919
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,560
was the corporate executive board did a

920
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,640
a study a few years ago

921
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,720
that found that there were six main

922
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,079
categories of reasons uh psychological

923
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,119
reasons

924
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,240
why our employees in our workforce

925
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,480
believed that security wasn't part of

926
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,520
their jobs right they had these beliefs

927
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,200
and assumptions

928
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,000
that

929
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,040
uh

930
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,280
uh actually related to insecure

931
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,880
behaviors and

932
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,480
um some of them was that they in fact

933
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,000
they didn't know the appropriate

934
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,839
behaviors in policy and so a training

935
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,520
was appropriate but the other five uh

936
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,079
were uh much more of a surprise so some

937
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,320
of them were not particularly interested

938
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,760
in security or thought it was too

939
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,839
overwhelming

940
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,359
they just didn't care about security

941
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,839
uh they didn't think that a

942
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,640
breach was possible or likely at an

943
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,320
organization

944
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,800
they thought security and

945
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,599
this is perception burn was too hard it

946
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,400
was too taxing it wasn't worth the juice

947
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
was not worth the squeeze

948
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
and finally they thought

949
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,800
uh everything was already fine why would

950
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,200
they why should they go about this and

951
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,640
as you can see

952
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,440
having any one of these fundamental

953
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
beliefs

954
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,000
can and absolutely would affect how

955
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
likely you're going to get

956
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,880
people reporting people clicking on

957
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,280
links people going out of their way

958
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,800
people like clara choosing to delay

959
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,440
a send in her organization

960
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,640
i sorry a shipping of code

961
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,800
in favor of security

962
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,320
and one of the best ways to measure

963
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,640
something like this

964
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,839
is

965
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,200
this awesome free survey

966
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,440
called the security force survey

967
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,640
and it is uh licensed under the creative

968
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,599
commons uh surveymonkey published a

969
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,720
a uh

970
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,560
free version of this on off of this

971
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,240
particular blog but there are several

972
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,480
versions that you can access on your own

973
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,119
and it helps

974
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,720
answer a couple of core questions

975
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,760
related to this mindset so how do my

976
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,000
employees view security do they feel

977
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,480
empowered to take action do they feel

978
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,359
that security team prioritizes this

979
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,200
and doing a survey like this in your

980
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,960
organization can help you map the

981
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,560
mindset

982
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,440
which is a great place to start

983
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,599
but as we started as we noted at the

984
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,520
very beginning

985
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,319
don't just stop at the mindset

986
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,599
the awareness around something and then

987
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,240
delivering into action are two

988
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,160
core things so you need to be measuring

989
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,280
both the above the iceberg and below the

990
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
iceberg

991
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,000
so that

992
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,280
is how we can provide visibility into

993
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,680
this very challenging problem

994
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,920
and the ability to understand

995
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,720
what our level of human risk is what are

996
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,760
the mindset of our employees can help us

997
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,119
understand

998
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,880
where we need to be focusing our time

999
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,160
and our attention

1000
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,000
where do we need to be

1001
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,400
driving change where do we need to be

1002
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,440
making better technology investments

1003
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,920
what kind of interventions we should be

1004
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,480
focusing on what regions need more but

1005
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
our of our intention

1006
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
so that's measurement

1007
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,359
let's flip over to the other side we

1008
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,960
just use a lot of our

1009
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,480
right brain then let's go to our left

1010
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,599
brain

1011
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,880
which is

1012
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,200
how do we actually get people to make

1013
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,240
more thoughtful security decisions

1014
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,920
and how do we

1015
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,200
influence

1016
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,680
the people that we work with

1017
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,400
on a regular basis to

1018
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,079
make

1019
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,960
more thoughtful security trade-offs like

1020
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,560
clara

1021
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,440
so

1022
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,720
let's bring up claire again and

1023
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,560
as you remember in that example

1024
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,040
she had several reasons

1025
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,079
um to push back on her

1026
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,160
uh desire or her or her interest to

1027
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,680
ship code

1028
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,680
so part of it was bonus deadlines

1029
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,880
management but fundamentally

1030
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,400
there was a there was a couple there was

1031
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,480
something missing that prevented her

1032
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,119
from actually executing on that

1033
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,920
now there's actually a formula in

1034
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,920
behavioral science that helps us

1035
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,839
understand

1036
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,839
and diagnose what's missing in an action

1037
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,359
and so to think through uh the study of

1038
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,280
behaviors if we if we go into the field

1039
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,200
of behavioral science there's the

1040
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,880
formula that you see in front of you

1041
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,119
that introduces the concept that three

1042
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,280
things need to exist at the exact same

1043
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,040
time in a moment

1044
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,400
for specific behavior to to happen

1045
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,480
i need to have the motivation

1046
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,400
to do that behavior

1047
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,720
i need to have the ability to do that

1048
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,480
specific behavior or action and i need

1049
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,880
something to remind me to do that

1050
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,560
in the case of clara just to wrap that

1051
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,800
up she may have absolutely had the

1052
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,960
ability to check the code in her

1053
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,480
organization but she may not have had

1054
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,920
the motivation

1055
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,200
she may not

1056
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,920
been motivated from a bonus perspective

1057
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,920
she may not have thought it was

1058
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,240
important she may not thought have

1059
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,319
thought it was part of her job she may

1060
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,680
not have thought her boss cared about it

1061
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,720
she may not have thought that

1062
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,040
anyone would have noticed so

1063
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,000
all of the reasons

1064
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,440
that

1065
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,800
are not related to her ability

1066
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,560
fall into the motivation category and as

1067
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,000
you can see that's a pretty large

1068
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,200
component

1069
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,200
now it's totally possible she doesn't

1070
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,640
know

1071
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,640
how to do this in which case secure

1072
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,480
coding would have been a great

1073
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,839
resource

1074
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,720
now if we unpack this formula even

1075
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,760
further

1076
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,000
we actually see that it has an inverse

1077
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,760
relationship to each other now this

1078
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,160
model was done by dr bj fogg out of

1079
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,960
stanford university and what his model

1080
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,319
shows is that motivation and ability

1081
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,040
have inverse relationships to each other

1082
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,400
so that the

1083
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,040
harder something is to do the higher

1084
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,400
motivation

1085
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,560
you need to actually do it

1086
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,319
now the exact opposite is true if

1087
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,680
something's really easy to do i don't

1088
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,000
need to particularly be motivated to do

1089
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,040
it and so when a trigger or a prompt

1090
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,599
happens in a and reminds me

1091
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,119
to do that action

1092
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,680
if the right balance of motivation and

1093
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,319
ability exist at the exact same time

1094
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,640
then i'll i will do that specific

1095
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,760
behavior or that specific action

1096
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,720
um and so we have two choices as

1097
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,560
security practitioners

1098
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,400
it to be able to change people's

1099
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,200
security behavior the first is to make

1100
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,280
something easier to do

1101
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,119
and the second one is to increase

1102
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,119
motivation

1103
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,760
let's take the first of that example

1104
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,839
something that's easier to do

1105
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,640
uh

1106
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,680
three

1107
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,599
security actions that i've been talking

1108
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,119
about in the model of human risk is

1109
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,640
secure

1110
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,200
password and credential management

1111
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,319
another one i would talk about is

1112
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,640
reporting and the third one is physical

1113
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,839
security

1114
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:36,880
so

1115
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,920
there

1116
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,440
um if we take a look at secure password

1117
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,200
practices so we would like people to

1118
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,119
have unique and secure passwords across

1119
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,079
all sites now the hard thing to do is to

1120
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,720
ask people to remember unique characters

1121
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,960
across all of their sites and and try to

1122
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,599
memorize that and

1123
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,040
studies have shown that it's actually

1124
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,760
very hard to do and most mere mortals

1125
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,560
cannot remember the security

1126
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,720
complexity length and uniqueness

1127
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,400
required to actually do this at the

1128
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,599
ultimate level

1129
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,640
so one of the ways for us to increase

1130
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,200
the ability of somebody to be able to do

1131
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,520
this action is to get them to install a

1132
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,920
password manager for example

1133
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,720
again this is not necessarily trending

1134
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,960
it is giving tools and technology to

1135
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,480
change a behavior

1136
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,920
same thing with reporting suspicious

1137
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,400
activity you could ask people

1138
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,359
to remember a specific url of the

1139
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,319
reporting guidelines please forward with

1140
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,119
the

1141
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,520
the headers attached

1142
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,680
or we can just install a reporting

1143
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,760
button in our organizations and to save

1144
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,040
just click this button when something

1145
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,040
doesn't look right so again we've made

1146
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,440
it easier to do

1147
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,599
less relevant for the era in which we

1148
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,280
are all working from home

1149
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,400
but in offices where we are trying to

1150
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,240
stop tailgating and make sure everyone's

1151
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,880
wearing physical badges we can try to

1152
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,040
create social norms

1153
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,480
in which

1154
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,560
we

1155
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,799
are

1156
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,520
figuring out how we get people to um

1157
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,440
hold each other accountable

1158
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,560
or we can install physical devices uh

1159
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,680
that

1160
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,400
allow called mantraps that actually uh

1161
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,760
let people come in and out

1162
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,839
one at a time just realizing the hard

1163
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,200
and easy for the last needs to be

1164
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,480
switched

1165
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,520
so

1166
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,480
uh

1167
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,079
that's how we can think about making

1168
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,559
something uh easier to do from an

1169
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,280
ability standpoint

1170
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,160
in the case of claire insecure coding

1171
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,240
the ability for her to have

1172
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,599
tools and scans to check her code before

1173
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,720
it gets shipped are one ways we can are

1174
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,760
ways we can help her with her secure

1175
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,520
coding process

1176
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,400
now

1177
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,480
let's talk about motivation

1178
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,599
motivation is largely one of the

1179
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,839
more unexplored areas and security

1180
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:06,800
because

1181
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,839
we often use a constant

1182
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,160
force and compliance and say if you

1183
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,559
don't do this

1184
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,839
then

1185
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,680
you'll hear from us

1186
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,040
so

1187
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,359
that's obviously not ideal um and

1188
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,119
uh we'll talk about positive and

1189
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,520
negative reinforcement but

1190
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,520
this section will show you three

1191
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,480
motivational hacks that i've seen in my

1192
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,640
experience decade plus experience

1193
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,400
getting people to want to do security

1194
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,240
instead of have to so the first

1195
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,240
motivational hack that i wanted to walk

1196
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,599
you through is one called social proof

1197
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,160
now you've seen social proof out in the

1198
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,240
wild because it has been used by

1199
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,160
marketing and

1200
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,400
and and

1201
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,040
and in fitness and in

1202
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,839
energy consumption for years now now

1203
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,200
social proof uses a

1204
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,640
a phenomenon in our minds of

1205
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,720
of getting us to

1206
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,880
follow the herd

1207
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,359
and we are constantly understanding

1208
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,240
looking around to see if we are behaving

1209
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,800
like everyone else around us and is our

1210
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,680
actions are our actions normal

1211
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,640
um a lot of the time this is not even

1212
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,000
conscious

1213
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,559
and so when we see on our uh we see on

1214
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,040
your screen there uh

1215
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,359
amazon and online shopping sites use

1216
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,280
social proof all the time and how they

1217
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,760
use their their reviews and say look at

1218
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,839
all these people these 2 000 people who

1219
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,559
think this is a great book

1220
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,119
you'll probably like it too so again

1221
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,200
signaling that this is like everybody

1222
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,359
else or if you're uh buying um or

1223
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,359
booking a a

1224
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,880
hotel room on online you can see

1225
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,200
this particular example six people are

1226
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,040
looking at this moment at this at this

1227
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,520
very moment this this has been booked 41

1228
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,760
times the last 24 hours it's in high

1229
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,160
demand only six rooms left again

1230
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,359
signaling

1231
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,000
others other people think this is very

1232
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,040
good

1233
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,200
and then the last is a

1234
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,680
has been used in the getting people to

1235
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,480
be more efficient in their energy uses

1236
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,160
and so

1237
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,319
you may have received an energy bill

1238
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,040
that shows you how

1239
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,520
well you did an energy consumption the

1240
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,920
last month compared to your neighbors

1241
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,319
and how much more less efficient you

1242
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,359
were

1243
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,000
now uh this has also been done in a few

1244
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,920
places for security

1245
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,559
uh georgia institute of technology and

1246
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,480
facebook teamed up a couple years ago to

1247
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,599
try to

1248
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,000
see if social proof worked well in

1249
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,240
getting people to turn on mfa for their

1250
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,440
accounts and in the control group and

1251
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,680
users got this notification and said you

1252
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,359
can use your security set you should use

1253
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,280
security settings like mfa it's good for

1254
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,000
you

1255
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,640
and then the last and then the main

1256
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,160
experimental group uh showed how many of

1257
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,880
a person's friends were already using

1258
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,200
this and so in this example there's 108

1259
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,040
of your friends are already using the

1260
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,280
security settings and you should too

1261
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,599
and they found that the social context

1262
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,800
was 1.36 times more effective at driving

1263
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,960
the adoption of mfa for those accounts

1264
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,400
than just

1265
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,079
good old security best practice

1266
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,599
we've seen

1267
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,680
in our work at elevate that comparing

1268
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,559
specific behaviors to your department

1269
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,520
like how good you are at

1270
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,200
detecting phishing attacks and not

1271
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,520
giving up your credentials

1272
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,599
has been widely successful in reducing

1273
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,599
fission click-through rates

1274
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,280
and in areas where people are not

1275
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,240
not

1276
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,880
as good compared to their peers

1277
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,960
following up with training and course

1278
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,000
corrective actions the uh people are

1279
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,400
much more likely to engage with the

1280
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,720
training after the fact after being

1281
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,240
presented with

1282
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,800
social proof showing them that they are

1283
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,440
below a specific threshold

1284
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,720
there's also

1285
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,480
a sneaky technique in social proof

1286
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,160
called celebrity social proof that

1287
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,599
highlights

1288
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,800
whether or not you are um

1289
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,160
sorry uh

1290
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,119
whether

1291
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,559
uh a famous person that you know is

1292
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,960
already doing that kind of technique um

1293
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,559
you see it again with uh famous

1294
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,680
sports stars showing off a specific type

1295
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,800
of shoes for example or outfits or

1296
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,920
makeup

1297
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,359
well the list goes on and on but

1298
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,760
we see again in advertising but in

1299
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,040
security

1300
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,119
we can do something very similar and

1301
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,440
similarly we found that when we

1302
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,359
highlight

1303
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,760
the fact that senior executives usually

1304
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,000
someone you respect ideally the ceo of

1305
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,160
companies use is doing a good behavior

1306
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,920
like using a particular password manager

1307
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,280
you

1308
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,920
were able to drive really great and fast

1309
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,960
adoption

1310
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,079
um

1311
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,200
in fact uh 80 80 adoption over six

1312
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,839
months just by using hot and

1313
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,880
highlighting celebrity social proof

1314
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,040
now the next area that i wanted to

1315
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,160
highlight

1316
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,480
is gamification

1317
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,040
now gamification is all all the rage

1318
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,599
these days but i wanted to

1319
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,680
level set on some definitions around

1320
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,680
what it is and isn't

1321
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,559
so gamification is not about playing

1322
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,160
games at work

1323
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,880
uh it is

1324
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,839
about using game mechanics things that

1325
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,800
make gaming successful

1326
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,000
into business environments that so you

1327
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,880
can drive engagement motivation and

1328
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,720
business results

1329
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,520
so

1330
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,359
uh i want to walk through a couple of

1331
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:54,480
examples where we've seen this in the

1332
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,079
wild so your airline miles are an

1333
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,760
excellent uh way of

1334
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,400
of show of seeing gamification

1335
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,880
being used to

1336
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,520
encourage loyalty to a particular

1337
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,400
airline brand and because of that

1338
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,960
because of our points and status and

1339
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,480
expiration

1340
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,280
they

1341
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,119
airlines have figured out how to get us

1342
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,960
to

1343
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,200
leave at certain times fly through

1344
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,800
different airplane

1345
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,559
airports

1346
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,480
all in favor of this loyalty status

1347
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,960
bonus points

1348
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,400
reward

1349
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,960
fitbit and similar fitness trackers are

1350
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,960
excellent at helping us do a couple

1351
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,720
extra jumping jacks a day just to make

1352
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,440
sure we either beat our own goals or be

1353
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,599
the goals of people we know

1354
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,400
your linkedin profile is gamified to

1355
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,040
encourage the behaviors the action

1356
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,799
of you

1357
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,200
completing your profile as you can see

1358
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,720
it ties into

1359
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,119
why they're asking you to do it it helps

1360
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,079
it helps you with your next step but

1361
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,920
there is a progress leader board that

1362
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,720
shows that you're moving all the way up

1363
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,559
to

1364
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,720
to completing account and last is

1365
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,559
loyalty to your favorite coffee club

1366
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,240
that shows by 10 get the 11th free again

1367
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,799
using reward and streaks the concept of

1368
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:20,480
streaks to

1369
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,599
to

1370
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,520
encourage

1371
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,960
uh loyalty to to the particular coffee

1372
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,240
brand

1373
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,319
how about using this in security

1374
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:34,079
so we've seen this uh similarly

1375
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,559
showing somebody where they are on a

1376
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,000
security strength score and giving them

1377
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,079
an idea of how well they

1378
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,040
are doing as far as

1379
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,760
becoming a excellent security champion

1380
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,200
organization

1381
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,680
if we go back to the example about how

1382
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,760
we are measuring human risk in our

1383
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,040
organizations we can use those data sets

1384
00:55:59,040 --> 00:55:59,760
and

1385
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,400
communicate using gamification

1386
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,640
how far away someone is from having

1387
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,720
excellent scores that's the example on

1388
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,799
the left now if we go all the way to the

1389
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,599
right we can use the gamification

1390
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,160
principle of competition

1391
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,720
to compare a department's performance

1392
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,079
against each other

1393
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,640
what i've seen this work really well is

1394
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,280
sharing picking a particular

1395
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,440
security action security behavior that

1396
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,359
you're trying to drive

1397
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,200
again if we go back to the example of

1398
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,119
secure coding

1399
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,079
how about

1400
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,799
scrum teams that have had

1401
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,280
the bugs closed within sla most

1402
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,200
frequently or introduced no security

1403
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,280
bugs at all

1404
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,040
and used that particular metrics to

1405
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,319
create a leader board and show how each

1406
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,319
department's leader is ranking against

1407
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,520
each other so you're creating

1408
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,160
competition amongst managers

1409
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,760
and lastly the one in the middle is

1410
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,960
creating a streak in competition at a

1411
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,079
company-wide level or a

1412
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,280
as a huge group collective

1413
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,839
now as you may be familiar

1414
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,280
the uh in safety cultures

1415
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,119
like oil and gas

1416
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:14,559
they or

1417
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,119
manufacturing they really care about the

1418
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,960
behavior of safety and so what they do

1419
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,480
is number of days since

1420
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,880
last accident or number of days since

1421
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,359
claim and so

1422
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,200
what you're doing is creating a streak

1423
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,040
that every employee is a participant of

1424
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,200
why not do something like this for your

1425
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,960
organizations

1426
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,000
how about number of days since last

1427
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,040
known

1428
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,520
successful fish at our company and it

1429
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,400
resets every time someone clicks and

1430
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,079
gives up their credentials

1431
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,760
um and

1432
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,160
so this provides extra motivation for

1433
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,880
every one of our individual employees

1434
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,040
to think just one second before they

1435
00:57:59,040 --> 00:57:59,839
click

1436
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,480
in case they reset their company clock

1437
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,720
so those are all ways we can use the

1438
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,760
elements of gamification so leaderboards

1439
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,920
scorecards

1440
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,680
and competition

1441
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,680
for security

1442
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,319
now the last one and the last area to

1443
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,200
focus on is positive reinforcement

1444
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,640
i want to start

1445
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,520
by

1446
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,640
defining

1447
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,280
positive versus negative reinforcement

1448
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,359
now negative reinforcement

1449
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:30,640
is when we strengthen a behavior

1450
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,839
uh

1451
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,720
with the removal of a negative outcome

1452
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:39,200
so i will i put on sunscreen

1453
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,920
to avoid getting sunburn

1454
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,520
so the behavior that i'm being

1455
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,440
reinforced is putting on sunscreen

1456
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,599
because doing that

1457
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,760
is the absence of a painful outcome

1458
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,440
in security

1459
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,799
this is something that we do very often

1460
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,960
if you don't have it if you don't click

1461
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,799
on a phishing link you don't have to

1462
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,640
take training

1463
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,680
that

1464
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,400
is a negative reinforcement

1465
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,359
um

1466
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:10,799
the example of positive reinforcement uh

1467
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,720
is something that we see often in

1468
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,880
training of our pets

1469
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,160
or our kids when we do potty training or

1470
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,000
good behaviors or chores

1471
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,880
when

1472
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,559
let's say your dog does something great

1473
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,960
like go outside uh go to the bathroom

1474
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,000
outside

1475
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,319
you then give them a treat and so the

1476
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,440
dog knows this is the action that

1477
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,920
that gives me positive reinforcement

1478
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,480
and so in that space

1479
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,319
the dog decides to make

1480
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:39,920
course corrections in their own life to

1481
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,160
get more of that good behavior

1482
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,680
and so

1483
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,760
when we think about let's say the

1484
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,839
example of fishing

1485
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,599
as i was mentioning earlier

1486
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,200
we use the training as a really as a

1487
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,559
painful motivator

1488
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:57,440
to

1489
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,240
to stop people from clicking on training

1490
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,400
but so many of our

1491
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,319
other behaviors are also negative

1492
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,960
reinforcement reset your password or

1493
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,240
we'll lock you out um take your annual

1494
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,640
security training or we'll lock you out

1495
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,400
wear your badge or you'll get escorted

1496
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,960
to security

1497
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,160
check your code or

1498
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,480
you'll get

1499
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,559
you'll get a notice from the security

1500
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:25,599
team

1501
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:26,799
what about

1502
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,799
using opportunities for security for

1503
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,440
positive reinforcement again back to the

1504
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,520
example of phishing

1505
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,680
what that would look like is when an

1506
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,000
employee does a great job of detecting

1507
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,160
an attack and reporting it

1508
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,720
replying back to the email replying to

1509
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,960
the employee and ceasing their manager

1510
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,559
letting them know that they did a great

1511
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,599
job using that particular event as an

1512
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,520
opportunity for recognition to their

1513
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,119
peers

1514
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,040
you can use similarly

1515
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,119
similar you can you can take this

1516
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,799
particular behavior

1517
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,520
and call it out at the next all hands

1518
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,119
everyone who's doing a particular

1519
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:04,880
security action

1520
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,319
very well

1521
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:09,040
used that as an opportunity to highlight

1522
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,880
great behavior in front of the entire

1523
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,880
organization

1524
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,119
and

1525
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,440
the last note on this is that

1526
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,200
while punishment can be very effective

1527
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,280
in short-term gain studies have found

1528
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,000
that positive reinforcement is just as

1529
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,400
effective at increasing the behavior

1530
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,440
you're trying to influence but also

1531
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,160
encourages an environment of engagement

1532
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,599
satisfaction

1533
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,839
so with using positive reinforcement

1534
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:42,160
with our security messaging and the in

1535
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,079
the security actions we want to drive

1536
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,480
again in reducing the human risk that we

1537
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,079
were talking about earlier

1538
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,240
by using positive reinforcement to

1539
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,400
encourage people to to

1540
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,960
get the the outcomes we'd like

1541
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,319
we are then also creating a

1542
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:01,359
culture between the security team

1543
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:04,480
and our employees that is built on trust

1544
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,000
and engagement and we are move we move

1545
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,079
away from being the department of no to

1546
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,880
being a colleague and an ally and a

1547
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,160
trusted resource for our security team

1548
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,480
and so in wrapping up

1549
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,079
i want to take us back to where we

1550
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:21,359
started

1551
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:24,960
which is the idea of the

1552
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,400
the employee

1553
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,039
being the weakest link

1554
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,039
and for decades

1555
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,359
we have thought

1556
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:37,359
um that it is the end user's fault for

1557
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,039
being dumb and that we should be

1558
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,839
investing in so much technology to work

1559
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,520
their way around it

1560
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,400
and

1561
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,160
we have found in the decades of doing so

1562
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,359
that it continues to be one of the areas

1563
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,039
of greatest

1564
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,839
pain in our in our

1565
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:59,280
security stacks and the reason we often

1566
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,200
end up on headlines

1567
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,920
and it is quite possible to have a

1568
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,160
different reality than that one

1569
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,960
and that reality is one in which our

1570
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,480
employees

1571
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,960
make thoughtful decisions in our

1572
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,559
organizations

1573
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,680
are able to detect and report suspicious

1574
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,760
attacks when they happen

1575
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,280
are able to be thoughtful and proactive

1576
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,000
in creating secure processes

1577
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,480
and are able to take preventative

1578
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,079
measures that leave us in a place

1579
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:34,400
of security resiliency instead of

1580
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,559
security vulnerability

1581
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,640
and so

1582
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,480
as we can see

1583
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,119
human risk affects every part of

1584
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,240
security there's not a div

1585
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,480
a division a department a section of

1586
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,760
security that doesn't have a stake

1587
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,160
in ensuring that we tackle human risk

1588
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,680
effectively

1589
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,079
the way we need to do this is in two

1590
01:03:58,079 --> 01:03:59,039
parts

1591
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,599
first we need to measure it we need to

1592
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,440
understand where risk lies in our

1593
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,039
organization

1594
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,160
and as we saw we have a lot of the

1595
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,000
technologies in place

1596
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,640
we can understand the decisions our

1597
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,720
employees are making today and use that

1598
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,520
to understand likelihood and and map

1599
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,880
human risk

1600
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,720
as it relates in our organizations today

1601
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,160
to create

1602
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,359
a map

1603
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,480
of

1604
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,480
where we need to be focusing our time

1605
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,720
and attention and our influence to

1606
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,119
actually change these behaviors and

1607
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:33,119
address this risk for for our

1608
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,400
departments

1609
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,000
the second half

1610
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,880
is

1611
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,280
the psychology and the influence part

1612
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,599
once we understand where these risks lie

1613
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,839
there are tools available to us rooted

1614
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,079
in behavioral science and psychology

1615
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,599
that can help us

1616
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,160
really focus on

1617
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,160
the motivation and increasing the

1618
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,559
ability of our employees

1619
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,079
to

1620
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:58,160
step up and become

1621
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,680
better security champions in our

1622
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,520
organization

1623
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,480
and if we fail to do this

1624
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,400
we will continue to see the same

1625
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,880
headlines time and time again

1626
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,760
of vulnerabilities in our organization

1627
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,240
and even the best technology advances

1628
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,319
will continue to be thwarted by the most

1629
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:17,599
ingenious

1630
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,559
of our employees and it isn't until we

1631
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:22,799
think about human risk in a whole new

1632
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:23,599
light

1633
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:24,880
can we

1634
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,400
tackle the weakest link and actually

1635
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,920
make it the strongest element of

1636
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,280
security

1637
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,359
and with that i'm happy to take any

1638
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,359
questions

1639
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,520
thank you masha for that deep dive into

1640
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,599
human risk if you're interested in

1641
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,440
hearing more from masha she'll be

1642
