the community

40
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,280
john was an employee in cyberside

41
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,000
when he resigned his job

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,759
his behavior was so suspicious

43
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,919
were multiple

44
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,440
uploads and downloads from his account

45
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,160
there were also suspicious login

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,920
accounts in

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,360
different geographical locations

48
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,239
now let's see how the insider threat

49
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,360
detection techniques using user behavior

50
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
analytics helped

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,160
to detect uh and send alert to the

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,840
security management

53
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,560
team

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,120
in this talk we are going to learn about

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,599
what is insider threat detection need

56
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,599
for the threat detection

57
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,319
how the behavioral analytics works types

58
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,280
of threats and use cases

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,400
what user behavioral analytics can do

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,800
and how do we automate this will help

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,519
in detecting the right threats by

62
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,040
following

63
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,200
the

64
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,760
insider threat detection is risk by

65
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,920
insiders who are within the organization

66
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,879
that is

67
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,560
employee or a contractor

68
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,200
like sensitive data theft

69
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,720
misuse of the access privileges or

70
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,040
fraudulent activity that puts the

71
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,799
organization reputation at risk

72
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,280
it is nothing but the capability to

73
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
detect potential insider threats

74
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,680
based on defined risky user activity

75
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,319
the insider's behavior can be malicious

76
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,000
or normal or ignorant that can intensify

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,319
the potential impact

78
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,400
to the organization

79
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,200
that might cause monetary or

80
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,680
reputational

81
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,040
we need insider threat detection

82
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,359
why

83
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,319
to notify the right people and provide

84
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,920
data to help

85
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,799
cyber security teams take the best

86
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,239
possible course of action

87
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,600
and also proactively maximizing the

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,520
ability to stop incidents from occurring

89
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,560
or

90
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,199
mitigating the risk from getting worse

91
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,280
too many false alarms if we have also

92
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,000
then it is a show stopper to detect

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,320
insider threats

94
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,280
because a false security alarm may

95
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,199
result in

96
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,240
short term or more loss of availability

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,080
so it is very important to have a

98
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,120
reliable insider threat detection

99
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,440
because loss of availability could

100
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,560
result in employees not being able to

101
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,280
have access to system

102
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,160
or

103
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,720
do their jobs effectively at the need of

104
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,199
the earth

105
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,759
maybe this can lead to

106
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,280
higher cost

107
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,479
or lost revenue and reputational damage

108
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,880
as well

109
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,280
who are the types of insiders

110
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,039
they are the people present within the

111
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,600
organization or maybe a somebody guest

112
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,080
who came organization but accessing your

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,680
wi-fi data

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
it might be careless workers

115
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,400
who does um all careless mischief by

116
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,759
unknowingly

117
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,160
and they can be insider agents

118
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,960
and they can be disgruntled employees

119
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,919
or

120
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,919
people who resign malicious insiders

121
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,199
these are

122
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,880
wantedly they do it

123
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,080
third party uses

124
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,639
and this

125
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,319
71

126
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,280
of

127
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,318
inadvertent data breach or leak

128
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,919
because of the careless user causing

129
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,120
accidental breach

130
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,520
65 percent negligent data breach

131
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,039
because user willingfully ignoring

132
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,400
policy but not malicious

133
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,280
and

134
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,880
60 percent are malicious data breach

135
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,000
user

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,880
willfully causing harm for the

137
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,319
enterprise or the organization

138
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,800
some of the abnormal user behaviors are

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,919
sending sensitive data to wrong email

140
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,759
ids

141
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,560
frequent uploads of the large data

142
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,440
uploads or downloads just like john did

143
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,000
too many emails

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,120
they send

145
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,080
with

146
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,120
quantity of attachments

147
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,160
and maybe a combination of such

148
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,680
anomalies detected as violation

149
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,599
inserting infected usb disk

150
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,840
performing another is system access

151
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,960
taking others credentials

152
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,400
detecting

153
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
or deleting

154
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,720
editing confidential information

155
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,240
sharing data over unsecured public

156
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,000
mediums

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,880
connecting to organizational critical

158
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,400
data sources via public wi-fi

159
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,199
repeated access for an

160
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,840
unauthorized data

161
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,360
and also

162
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,800
experiencing multiple login locations in

163
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,319
five to ten minutes which is an abnormal

164
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,680
behavior for the use

165
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,440
and it is very important to detect this

166
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,280
insider thread

167
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,319
detecting or eliminating an insider

168
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,199
thread is nothing but

169
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,759
analyzing the user behavior

170
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,560
and knowing what to look for across the

171
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,840
enterprise that could indicate malicious

172
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,639
insider activity

173
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,319
to name few

174
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,840
indicators of audit log tampering

175
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,560
suspicious commands

176
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,240
executed

177
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,080
account sharing

178
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,880
or authentication anomalies self

179
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,679
escalation of privileges and awareness

180
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,838
of

181
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
what is ueba

182
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,559
user

183
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,279
entity behavior analytics

184
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,160
if you look at this slide here user and

185
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,600
behavior is getting intersected

186
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,839
that is where the threat is so

187
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,440
upea is

188
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,959
analytics data analytics driven threat

189
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,000
detection technology

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,120
that uses machine learning and data

191
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,279
science to understand

192
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,959
how

193
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,800
insiders

194
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,640
or employees within and corporate

195
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
behave

196
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,040
this actually helps to find out risky or

197
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,920
any suspicious activity

198
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,279
that deviates from a normal daily

199
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,839
baseline activities

200
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,040
and

201
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,200
automated system

202
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,760
also gives risk score

203
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,839
based on the amount of deviation

204
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,640
also the type of behavior of the user

205
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,360
that might be a threat so higher the

206
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
risk score so

207
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,120
it is um

208
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
critical for us to

209
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,839
fix the risk

210
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,680
and there are many

211
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,800
anomaly algorithms supervised learning

212
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
or unsupervised learning

213
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,920
machine learning techniques to baseline

214
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,040
normal activity or used

215
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
and also

216
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,000
this has been proved to be a successful

217
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
model in

218
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,800
detecting notorious insider threat

219
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,519
behaviors

220
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,640
coming to the

221
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,000
different anomalies um example for

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,800
logins that can be after our logins

223
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,720
or

224
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,680
logins on users pc or at the same time

225
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,920
if they have logins on others pc login

226
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,560
duration time login frequency

227
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,800
these are the parameters used in the

228
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,160
algorithms

229
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,959
and for files file activities time of

230
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,360
the day file created date

231
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,040
copied moved written renamed or deleted

232
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,920
dates

233
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,360
for database activities um

234
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,560
which

235
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
data items were accessed

236
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,519
were there any modifications made what

237
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,440
time they were accessed etc for http web

238
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,760
server logs um from from web server logs

239
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,160
we can get whether the website is

240
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,079
encrypted or browser information history

241
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,760
keywords uh

242
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,120
in

243
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,800
multiple browsers for removable devices

244
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,839
um from the event logs we can get device

245
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,959
name and type they are logged with usage

246
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,560
code time of the day activity code etc

247
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,279
for the email email transaction logs is

248
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,600
a source to get this information

249
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,160
um and we can get the source and

250
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,839
destination destination of the email

251
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,040
like email traffic and the communication

252
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,639
patterns in case of mobile calls it is

253
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,560
source and destination of the mobile

254
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,360
calls and duration and time of calls

255
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,200
communication patterns

256
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,480
for the print activity logs

257
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,639
it can be the id activity code time of

258
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,279
day name of document printed and the

259
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,880
number of copies printed and the tcp ipv

260
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,760
workflows are logs it is the source and

261
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,959
destination of ip packets on a tcp ip

262
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,519
network the size of traffic sent over

263
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,240
the connections the average duration of

264
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,360
connections positive and failed events

265
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,240
from different ip addresses and time

266
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,639
difference between the ip events is

267
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,839
calculated for the

268
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,480
algorithm

269
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,240
now how these anomalies can be

270
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,959
detected

271
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,480
as we have seen in the example of the

272
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,519
john

273
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,680
john is uploading

274
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,839
huge volumes of the documents which is a

275
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,120
suspicious activity that can be detected

276
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,920
by volumetric analysis which is um

277
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,240
similar to behavioral anomaly

278
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,200
where

279
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,480
it detects

280
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,519
deviations from normal behavior in terms

281
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,639
of size or volume

282
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,760
that means when an employee moves or

283
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,959
uploads large volumes of data as

284
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,760
compared to their past behavior then

285
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,959
order notification will be triggered and

286
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,320
there is also

287
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,399
pair based anomaly detection

288
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,839
now let's see some statistics

289
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,199
pharmaceutical or life sciences takes

290
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,839
the highest precedence for insider

291
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,839
threats which is

292
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,040
in this domain there are 28.3 percent of

293
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,160
insider threats that were detected

294
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,560
as per the latest report

295
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,600
and banks and financial organizations it

296
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,360
is

297
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,240
27.7 percent almost same as a

298
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,120
medical or life senses

299
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,399
and information technology it is 13.2

300
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,160
percent

301
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,000
oil gas and utilities it is 10.7

302
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,839
in telecommunications it is 8.2 percent

303
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,920
and manufacturing it is six point three

304
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,720
percent health care it is five percent

305
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,360
and restored um retail services

306
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,680
out of all these domains

307
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,839
most of the threat is 62

308
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,440
data theft

309
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,000
is happening everywhere

310
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,639
and the second one with 90 percent which

311
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,560
is privileged

312
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,959
account misuse

313
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,240
a 9.5 percent is data aggregation or

314
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,880
snooping

315
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,399
this helps to analyze where exactly we

316
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,040
need to focus as enterprise

317
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,040
organizations

318
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,800
coming to the use cases

319
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,240
there are multiple login failures

320
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,360
to cloud collaboration applications from

321
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,000
seven to nine countries within a seven

322
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
day time frame

323
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,880
this

324
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,240
happened

325
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,880
for a multinational company which is a

326
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,480
suspicious activity that

327
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,360
can be detected using user behavior

328
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,560
analytics

329
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,440
um

330
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,639
this is an insider threat and also there

331
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,120
are multiple cases in misuse of a

332
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,839
service account

333
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,320
it happened for a famous hotel

334
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,279
and there are um

335
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,079
insiders found logging in from two rare

336
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,560
countries indicating a compromised

337
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,000
account that means

338
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,399
uh their accounts got hacked or they

339
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,399
would have shared their credentials to

340
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,079
somebody

341
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,320
and there is geolocation based

342
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,040
violations where a service account was

343
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,000
logged

344
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,199
used in to login to a critical business

345
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,399
application using two different source

346
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,000
addresses from different countries say

347
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,040
india and china within an hour

348
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,839
and we all know right

349
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,279
the famous recent twitter hack happened

350
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,839
a couple of months back a massive

351
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,190
security incident that affected um

352
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,560
[Music]

353
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,079
some of the

354
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,880
famous celebrities who has millions of

355
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,040
followers

356
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,839
this is an insider attack targeted some

357
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
of the twitter employees with access to

358
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,759
internal systems and tools

359
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,639
it's the humans

360
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,680
that are being compromised by hackers

361
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,160
of unknowingly due to the careless

362
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,519
behavior and one trick game

363
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,079
twitter would have used the user

364
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,199
behavior analytics technology

365
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,519
that would help

366
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,319
in detecting this case of insider

367
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,359
behavior by alarming the system tricks

368
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,799
based on multiple behavioral pattern and

369
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,359
sending the notifications to the system

370
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,359
automatically

371
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,880
and this automatic

372
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,400
uh the risk notifications use certain

373
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,720
patterns using machine learning and data

374
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,200
science techniques

375
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,080
for the risk score

376
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,799
and the other use cases can be identity

377
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,880
theft for um your pi information or bank

378
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,480
account information can be get

379
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,840
compromised by the internal bank

380
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
employees and that can be used for some

381
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,200
other purpose even in medical cases also

382
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,320
uh

383
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,640
somebody might be impersonating you or

384
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,919
taking your

385
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,559
insurance claims and all and there are a

386
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,360
lot of banking and credit card fraud a

387
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,600
fraudsters can steal your card account

388
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,440
numbers and pin numbers and security

389
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,480
codes to make unauthorized transactions

390
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,640
um and they often steal your pii data as

391
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,440
well right so it is very important as an

392
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,160
insider to protect this information and

393
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,679
if such suspicious activities are

394
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,640
done um to actually detect them

395
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,400
now how does this data

396
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,960
detects using the models for insider

397
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,120
thread detection so these are the

398
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,679
commonly used models the clustering

399
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,240
algorithm is regression based or most

400
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
commonly used and there are individual

401
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,440
behavioral models where we train the

402
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,600
model based on the data and the

403
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,919
behavioral patterns and community

404
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,919
behavioral patterns which is another

405
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,480
interesting subject which is out of the

406
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
scope for this talk and there are

407
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,799
resource usage model patterns the

408
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,120
capacity models patterns and mixer

409
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
system

410
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,039
these are the three pillars of uepa

411
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,480
data analytics data integration third

412
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,039
one is data presentation

413
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,440
coming to data analytics

414
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,640
it uses data on the normal behavior of

415
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,480
the users and entities to build a

416
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,280
profile of how they normally act

417
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,120
here we can apply statistical models

418
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
in order to detect

419
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,200
unusual behavior and alert the system

420
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,160
administration

421
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,039
second is a data integration

422
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,080
that means ub ueba systems are able to

423
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,280
compare data from various

424
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,559
sources

425
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,760
such as

426
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,960
logs

427
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,640
capture data

428
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,960
and

429
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,559
other data sets with existing security

430
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,320
systems

431
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,880
and the data presentation is a third one

432
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,679
is a process through which

433
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,760
behavioral analytical systems

434
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,679
communicate their findings

435
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,240
um this is done via issuing a request

436
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,840
or sending a notification to a security

437
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,679
lead to

438
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,760
investigate the unusual behavior and its

439
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,400
root cause

440
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,559
one thing

441
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,480
any insider attack has in common is that

442
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,520
they are

443
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,679
unpredictable

444
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,280
that's why technology comes into picture

445
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,960
here

446
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,000
some people think that security is all

447
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,360
about human behavior yes

448
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,240
but

449
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,400
technology can be applied to human

450
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,559
behavior

451
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,840
then

452
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,640
that can be utilized in the right way

453
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,039
if an employee starts downloading

454
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,360
unusual large number of files similar to

455
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,640
the one

456
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,960
john did

457
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,400
the right situation

458
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,080
with behavioral analytics can flag that

459
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,520
activity so that your security team can

460
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,159
investigate further

461
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,520
which would have done in twitter attack

462
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,400
and due to the covet 19 whatever

463
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,520
taught us overnight we got connected

464
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,400
um and our kids are attending online

465
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,880
classes

466
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,080
going forward more employees work

467
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,240
remotely and it is all work from

468
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,679
anywhere

469
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,320
so it's even more important for the

470
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,679
organizations to find a way to monitor

471
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,400
what's happening on the servers

472
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,960
24 by 7

473
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,480
so that

474
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,600
will be happening using user behavioral

475
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,559
analytics and these are some of the

476
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,559
refer

477
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,400
with my session

478
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,919
humans are the biggest links in chain

479
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,400
people are the target

480
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,200
if utilized in right manner using proper

481
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,120
machine learning techniques

482
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,559
this is worth for enterprises

483
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,679
invest on behavioral analytics opposed

484
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,960
to traditional detection techniques

485
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,919
this helps to shield enterprises from

486
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,679
insider threats

487
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,080
hope enterprises would see the benefit

488
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,600
of it and become adopted to it

489
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,720
so in summary today we have learned what

490
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,039
is insider threat detection

491
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,559
how to detect based on user behavior

492
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,559
why it is important

493
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,600
and also the need for automating insider

494
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,159
the detection and automation by

495
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,240
behavioral analytics

496
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,440
and how ue be a benefit enterprise

497
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,760
security team

498
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,640
thank you proactive user behavioral

499
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,000
analytics detect insider threats be

500
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,360
vigilant be cautious and be watchful

501
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,400
thank you
