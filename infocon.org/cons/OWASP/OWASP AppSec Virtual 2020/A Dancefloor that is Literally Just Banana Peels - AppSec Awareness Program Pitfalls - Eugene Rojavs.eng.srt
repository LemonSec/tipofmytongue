1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,520
hi everybody my name is eugene rojowski

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,759
and this is talk with a fancy name a

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,759
dance floor that has literally just been

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,000
an appeals absec awareness program

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,559
pitfalls

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,599
i'm currently absec researcher at check

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,160
marks before that i was a lead security

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,840
engineer at a big enterprise in fintech

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,720
overall nine years i'm making the world

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,279
a more secure place

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,000
currently at check marks i'm responsible

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,920
for its awareness program and

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,079
training product called code bashing but

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,320
i promise you not to sell you anything

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,680
today and not to be a marketing pitch

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
i will be as objective and

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,160
unbiased as i can

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,399
so let's begin

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,199
this talk is relevant for you

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,079
if

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,079
you either want to roll out an abstract

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,600
awareness program

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
or you're in the middle of implementing

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,719
the program and you feel you are stuck

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,959
or you have some problems

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,680
and it also fits you if you manage

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,000
people who are responsible for abstract

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,439
awareness program

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,720
to start with

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,240
appsec program in general is very broad

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,040
and covers a lot of aspects

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,960
there's a lot of data in the internet

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,280
about how to secure your devops how to

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
secure a cloud

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,799
how to inject security tools into ci cd

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,040
and many more technical things you can

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,079
do

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,600
each part is very important but

39
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,720
i think that awareness that awareness

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
program when it's done right it's a key

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,640
to other abstract program aspects

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,799
it will allow you to enhance and speed

43
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,439
up the adoption of other aspects of

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,479
absent program by dragging developers

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,799
and management to your side

46
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,200
so you are allies with them instead of

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,159
them constantly resisting whatever you

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,840
do

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,040
everybody would tell you

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,919
that you need to raise awareness but

51
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,920
nobody tells you how

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,720
so today i will try to answer the

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,200
question how to raise it

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,120
uh but i don't want to throw at you

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
things that you probably will hear it

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,440
marketing pitches and that salesman will

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,080
tell you how to succeed

58
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,640
no on the contrary i want to share my

59
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
story

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,879
uh about the mistakes

61
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,120
i made while implementing an abstract

62
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,599
awareness program

63
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,840
i've gathered my experience and the

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,519
community knowledge

65
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,120
so now i can point out the pitfalls and

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,280
the things that are usually done

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,640
incorrectly that are problematic

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,680
and

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,480
that you are probably going to get into

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,560
if you are implementing the appstack

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
awareness program

72
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,920
and the first thing

73
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,879
you can do is actually get stuck without

74
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,280
even starting

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,800
for example

76
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,360
when i've started i got a task to roll

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
out absec program

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,319
i've decided to start with awareness

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,440
program

80
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,319
i've opened so youtube watch a lot of

81
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,760
talks so talked to some vendors

82
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,080
read a lot of articles

83
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,640
there's a lot of information about it

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,640
but very few solutions

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,480
i've made

86
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,640
a description for

87
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,879
awareness program

88
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,080
uh

89
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,400
could you cut it that

90
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
that is bad

91
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,480
the way that i've defined the awareness

92
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,599
program

93
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,640
is

94
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,760
you need to a give a solid knowledge

95
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,760
base for developers in apsec and b which

96
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,560
is

97
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,439
uh

98
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,840
as important as the first point you need

99
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,040
to raise development engagement in all

100
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
pepsico activities

101
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,319
and a good place to start is a wasp sam

102
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,040
thanks to the project lead sabbah and

103
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,480
bart who made a huge work to help us

104
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,040
with rolling out absolute programs so

105
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,478
oasp sam

106
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,440
has several maturity levels

107
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,600
in each apsec program aspect

108
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,919
you can start with the first maturity

109
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,080
level of training and awareness that

110
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,680
tells you to give the basic knowledge

111
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,560
for everybody who is involved into

112
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
development

113
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,280
another os project that will help you to

114
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,600
do that is the wasp top 10. so you can

115
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,120
take top 10 give it to your developers

116
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,840
as the basic knowledge

117
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,120
but

118
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,280
what would happen if you just take the

119
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,280
top 10 blindly and give it to everybody

120
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,000
you would get into a pitfall of not

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,440
knowing your audience for example

122
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,759
if you teach the developers the hardcore

123
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,840
cpp developers who write embedded

124
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,320
code and you teach them xss

125
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,039
that's totally not relevant or on the

126
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,560
contrary if you give front-end

127
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,680
developers

128
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,840
descriptions of all kind of memory

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,240
overflows and issues

130
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,320
more than that if you are teaching

131
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,479
seasoned developers the very basics

132
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,520
let's say of sql injections

133
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,320
then it won't be relevant to them

134
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,639
one more thing that i've encountered on

135
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,600
my own experience is that

136
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
you need to understand that

137
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
giving courses in english for

138
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,320
non-english native speakers may be a

139
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,280
problem even if you are a good english

140
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,039
speaker that maybe the problem for

141
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,759
some of the developers and if it is

142
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,960
then

143
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,120
overall the development management won't

144
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,800
agree to

145
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,639
take the course in english because some

146
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,759
of the people just cannot take

147
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,800
so irrelevant training material

148
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,919
leads to resistance from the trainees

149
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,520
and

150
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,400
what can you do with that is first

151
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,680
you can

152
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,600
make a list of relevant technologies

153
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
to

154
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,680
give

155
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,720
your trainees the relevant material

156
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,919
meaning

157
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,960
uh

158
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,039
you just pick up the frameworks the

159
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,240
languages

160
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,720
everything that they use

161
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
and then put it into the training

162
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,000
material

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,880
the second thing

164
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,680
uh you should speak the same language

165
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,800
with them

166
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,120
meaning capsic engineers should be

167
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,280
proficient with programming to the point

168
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,080
where developers treat them as equals

169
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,599
and when capsic engineers can

170
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,160
understand whatever the developer tells

171
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,520
and not just

172
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,599
nod and say yeah okay that's a solution

173
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,000
no you must understand what you're

174
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,039
talking about with developers

175
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,240
next thing

176
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
you need to assess

177
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,400
the overall knowledge and get the

178
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,000
picture of the absence state

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,280
usually when the company

180
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,039
culture the company's

181
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,199
absent posture

182
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,880
is very immature then it's pretty clear

183
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,319
that the over level is very basic but it

184
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,560
actually may vary from team to team

185
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,039
let's say you have a team that came from

186
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,880
a different company that

187
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,479
have

188
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,599
great

189
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,039
apsec

190
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,319
expertise and actually this team

191
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,800
knows absent but you are going to teach

192
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,879
them the very basics

193
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,599
how can you understand that well how can

194
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,039
you assess the

195
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,360
overall level you can give question

196
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,720
aries like short ones easy ones or you

197
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
can talk to development managers to get

198
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,599
the overall knowledge of the team

199
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,400
and the last thing that you need to do

200
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,720
is to measure the initial point

201
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
that is actually the thing that i didn't

202
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,479
do while implementing my program and it

203
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,360
was very hard to track progress

204
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,240
in a year let's say

205
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,759
so

206
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,479
you need to choose the exact metrics

207
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,240
that are aligned with your absence

208
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,800
programs there's a lot of metrics in the

209
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,919
internet you need to find the fitting

210
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,399
i won't tell you exact ones right now

211
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,519
you need to choose yourself

212
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,399
after you know what you need

213
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,519
you even may have a short list of vendor

214
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,799
products

215
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,640
uh you come to management to get the

216
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,320
budget

217
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,720
and unexpectedly

218
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
what you get in response is that

219
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,360
whatever you suggest is too expensive

220
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,560
and you need to do it yourself

221
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,959
this is exactly what happened to me

222
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,240
i will explain uh in a few slides why it

223
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,800
happened why you don't get automatic

224
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,440
management buy-in

225
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,160
when you come and ask for budget

226
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
but now let's focus on

227
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,720
buying and making the in-house program

228
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,120
let's take a look at pros and cons of

229
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,640
each

230
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,760
approach

231
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,040
first of all

232
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
both of them

233
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,160
are good

234
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,920
and both of them

235
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,440
are viable and they do the job in

236
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
depending on the case depending on your

237
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,120
goal

238
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,440
i'm not saying that if you buy something

239
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,920
it will be way better than you

240
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,120
can develop in-house no totally not

241
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
second thing

242
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,920
both of them

243
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,040
require

244
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,680
absence specialist

245
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,480
at least on the rollout stage it doesn't

246
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,959
matter if you buy it or you create one

247
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,120
you need to roll it out and you need a

248
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,080
knapsack a specialist who will

249
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,839
spend a lot of time

250
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,640
making sure that everybody

251
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,600
did whatever you suggested in the

252
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,040
program

253
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,200
of course in-house training requires a

254
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,839
lot more time because

255
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,200
you need a highly paid absolute person

256
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,000
to create something first

257
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
so the main point i want to stress here

258
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,720
is that the choice between

259
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,399
uh in-house and vendor-based program

260
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,399
should be objective

261
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,720
you it shouldn't be driven by lack of

262
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,600
budget and the attitude of management

263
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,320
that doesn't want to give you money

264
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,519
but in my case as i've said it was not

265
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,839
an issue and i didn't get the budget

266
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,279
so

267
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,399
let's take a look why there are two main

268
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,760
reasons

269
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,800
two main

270
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,640
mindsets of

271
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,880
management that doesn't allow you to do

272
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,120
that to get the budget

273
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,880
first of all

274
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,920
security is the job of the security team

275
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,079
i bet most of you heard that at least

276
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,920
once from management

277
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,680
and the second thing

278
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,360
is that security team only spends money

279
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,160
and earns nothing

280
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,640
so having management with this approach

281
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,480
with this mindset

282
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,120
will lead to two problems

283
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,440
first of all you won't get a fancy

284
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,399
budget for your tools and team

285
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,839
and the second

286
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,800
uh developers won't help you with the

287
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,519
abstract activities

288
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,360
in my case

289
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,440
i had this structure

290
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,079
uh the apsec team was and the

291
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,040
development team were under cdo

292
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,920
who had some senior management

293
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,639
and we got the task to

294
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,519
implement the apsec program

295
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,160
but we didn't have support from syrian

296
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,800
management who were ready to buy in and

297
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,320
support us budget wise and also we

298
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,079
didn't have support of the development

299
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,200
team

300
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,399
who

301
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,360
just

302
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,399
sabotaged whatever we did

303
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,120
but there's a worse case

304
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,399
when haptic team is under a different

305
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,600
um

306
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,560
c-level manager than a development team

307
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,399
then you need to

308
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,839
convince even more people

309
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,240
so

310
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,800
to fix that

311
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,959
first of all you need to get

312
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,320
sponsorship of higher management there

313
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,160
are several ways

314
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,279
uh how you can do it

315
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,639
you need to

316
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,920
show the importance of abstech to them

317
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,000
you can do it by

318
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,880
showing the risk assessment because risk

319
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,240
assessment

320
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,839
ends up with numbers with money so

321
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,920
this is convincing enough when you show

322
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
that company can

323
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,600
lose this amount of money and

324
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,000
apsec program cost less

325
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,480
it would work perfectly

326
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,120
especially after the pen test that shows

327
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,519
that it's trivial to

328
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,839
just smash the whole company still

329
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,519
whatever you have

330
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,200
and

331
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,600
it's cheaper to implement the abstract

332
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,440
program than

333
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,560
being hacked

334
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,720
and another approach

335
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,600
which has its own pros and cons that i

336
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,360
will talk about later

337
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,720
is

338
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,639
getting the support through compliance

339
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,360
requirements let's say you have

340
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,600
industrial or pci dss or any kind of

341
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,760
compliance requirements that you need to

342
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,040
comply with

343
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,839
so you can leverage that and get the

344
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,920
support from management but you got to

345
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,399
be careful with that and i will show you

346
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,639
a bit later why

347
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,560
but getting

348
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,440
support from management

349
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,079
is not enough

350
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,399
the second part of it

351
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,320
you need to get the support from the

352
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,839
development team

353
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,480
ideally of course you need to make the

354
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,800
security a part of their job

355
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,519
but it actually

356
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,639
the topic of a separate talk or even

357
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,040
several talks because it's very hard to

358
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,680
make and if you can manage that well

359
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,920
your doors are open for pretty much any

360
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,959
company that you like

361
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,480
an alternative way is to

362
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,600
interest developers thus engaging them

363
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,839
into appstack activities

364
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,279
developers are curious by nature and

365
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,120
when you show them

366
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,560
something that

367
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,360
is

368
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,880
security related but also is relevant to

369
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,480
development

370
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,040
they dig into it they

371
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,480
try to understand

372
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,279
both the security and the from security

373
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,199
and development perspective and they

374
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,959
actually help you with that

375
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,760
they kind of do your job

376
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,920
so to conclude

377
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,560
you need to have support on all the

378
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,199
levels on the management level and the

379
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,320
development team level

380
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,399
uh but to be honest

381
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,560
when you have high budgets a lot of

382
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,120
experts in your team development team

383
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,399
supporting you

384
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,680
exist only in the world of unicorns

385
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,639
and another pitfall that you probably

386
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,720
will get into is that

387
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,120
you have not enough resources so you

388
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,839
don't have enough time for training

389
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,320
because the absent team has other

390
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,399
priorities

391
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,600
usually security teams are understaffed

392
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,040
and the rate of

393
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,320
absent experts to developers is 1 200

394
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,279
and it doesn't change in time

395
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,160
so when the priorities and efforts of

396
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,360
the apsec team are dispersed between

397
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,680
different tasks

398
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,839
likely awareness program

399
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,160
won't will be harmed and

400
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,639
running it out will take a lot of time

401
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,079
or even it may not happen

402
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,320
so what you should understand

403
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,000
approaching the

404
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,399
approaching apsec awareness program is

405
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,600
that

406
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,399
it takes time

407
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,120
both in-house and vendor base it doesn't

408
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,560
matter they require a lot of time from

409
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,199
absent people

410
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,199
moreover

411
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,320
it requires the person who owns it

412
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,800
because without an owner who is

413
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,920
responsible for making sure that

414
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,199
the

415
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,519
awareness program happens

416
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,160
who has enough authority enough skills

417
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,639
your program won't happen

418
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,680
but

419
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,079
even if you invest enough effort

420
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,399
and people and time

421
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,880
into the program there is still way to

422
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,199
fail

423
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,799
if you make your trainees read long

424
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,079
texts or watch long videos you're likely

425
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,240
to fail because absent experts who are

426
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,799
responsible for awareness program

427
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,359
are likely are not experts in

428
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,679
e-learning in making the

429
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,080
effective engaging e-learning courses

430
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,960
and

431
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,919
if the learning material is boring it's

432
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,720
just

433
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,240
walls of text it's a long video without

434
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,720
any hand on activity

435
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,880
then probably you will bore your

436
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,559
trainees to death

437
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,559
and this will resist uh in active

438
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,440
resistance from the developers to any

439
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,919
abstic activity because

440
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,080
from that point the

441
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,640
apsec team will be perceived

442
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,760
as people who waste time and ask for

443
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,520
things that are

444
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,400
boring and not interesting

445
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,320
you even can write an excellent

446
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,640
description of vulnerabilities

447
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,400
or give developers

448
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,640
videos that are

449
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,320
interesting but

450
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,679
without

451
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,799
uh the engaging part without hand on

452
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,840
part

453
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
it won't be enough

454
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,480
so what you need to do

455
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,440
is to engage developers

456
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,240
by for example hands-on activities some

457
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,799
competition interactive learning

458
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,679
material and so on so let's take a look

459
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,440
at several examples

460
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,799
cdfs

461
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,840
work for developers cdfs are not things

462
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,000
for appsec professionals but

463
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,520
i'm talking about the basic level of cdf

464
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,280
you can take

465
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,679
the basic vulnerable apps like juice

466
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,960
shop or os code something relevant for

467
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,760
the

468
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,799
technological stack that you are using

469
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,080
add a free cdf platform like the one

470
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,960
facebook provides

471
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,440
then you can add beers and some swag for

472
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,760
the winners you create a tournament you

473
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,880
create a competition you make sure that

474
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,080
everybody

475
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,039
uh are equal if you break people for

476
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,520
example in the teams that

477
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,160
let's say you don't have

478
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,039
a seasoned team against juniors it won't

479
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,679
be fair so

480
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,480
juniors will be very sad after that so

481
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,840
make sure that it's healthy competition

482
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,400
and it will work people will be engaged

483
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
and will

484
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,840
participate in it gladly

485
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,679
moreover

486
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,080
there are some

487
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,840
a few but still there are

488
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,640
some free gamified learning platforms

489
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,280
i'm saying word gamification here

490
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,480
because

491
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,360
it's not only something that abstract

492
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,159
awareness program vendors will sell you

493
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,200
it's also the top-notch approach for

494
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,919
e-learning that's why everybody's trying

495
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,200
to use it

496
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,080
and

497
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,720
it really works

498
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,240
and the last thing

499
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,200
you can show to your trainees

500
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,720
is

501
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,280
a vulnerable app there are a bunch of

502
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,320
them online that don't require

503
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,559
rolling out virtual machines or

504
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,919
something like that

505
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,440
let's say you can

506
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,640
give the link to hack yourself first or

507
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,360
uh more specific issues like

508
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,840
shown in nexus game

509
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,919
uh the most interested developers will

510
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,600
open it and actually

511
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
click through it and try to hack

512
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,039
something

513
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,640
developers

514
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,440
are

515
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,520
eager to hack things with some guidance

516
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,200
but even if you do all these activities

517
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,360
once a year

518
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,840
it's not good

519
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,600
enough the effect of the training the

520
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,679
effect of whatever you did

521
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,640
will quickly fade out

522
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,520
but

523
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,120
uh having it yearly is good only in a

524
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,200
single case

525
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,240
it's good for a compliance driven

526
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,840
training

527
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,159
uh as i've mentioned before and coming

528
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,640
back to compliance driven awareness and

529
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,159
training program

530
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,960
so once a year you can

531
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,200
ask everybody to take a course

532
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,840
put check marks as in the list show it

533
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,280
to the auditor

534
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,200
and you're good

535
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,440
but

536
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,520
it's it's a bad approach giving it once

537
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,159
or twice a year it's a bad approach for

538
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,320
a mature absent program it won't work

539
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,280
moreover a yearly program has one more

540
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,760
pitfall

541
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,159
you need to consider the turnover and

542
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,760
the team growth

543
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,240
that decreases the training coverage in

544
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,360
time so let's take a look at example

545
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,960
let's say you have 100 trainees and

546
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,400
somehow

547
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,600
you managed to train the hundred percent

548
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,559
of them

549
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,240
but in a year

550
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,440
let's say

551
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,559
25 people quit and they are replaced

552
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,000
with 25 new people and also there are 25

553
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,039
new positions so in the end of the year

554
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,919
you have 125 trainees

555
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,240
but only 60 of them

556
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,960
are

557
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
trained

558
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,200
also i'm not considering that knowledge

559
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,360
fades out and

560
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,640
i bet that the major part of them won't

561
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,600
even remember the course training that

562
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,520
they took a year ago

563
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,559
so instead of going yearly

564
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,000
you need to

565
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,400
remind developers about absolute

566
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,600
existence

567
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,640
gently

568
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,039
and continuously

569
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,840
you can do it

570
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,880
as i've mentioned by organizing cdfs and

571
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,840
other

572
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,679
let's say code reviews

573
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,840
something that is challenging

574
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,480
interesting and has competition in

575
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,159
other than that you can give internal

576
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,200
abstract talks to developers

577
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,440
for example you can participate in the

578
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,480
internal meetups guild meetings whatever

579
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,559
you have in the company

580
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,678
moreover you can uh create an appsec

581
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,280
mailing

582
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,159
that just points out the most

583
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,120
interesting things happened in apsec

584
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,840
world that are related to

585
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,360
things happening inside of the company

586
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,600
next you can show the vulnerabilities

587
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,720
that you found in the company's products

588
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,080
developers

589
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,919
usually think that

590
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,559
other developers make vulnerable code

591
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,840
and they are flawless and they're good

592
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,320
but if you show them that they are

593
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,720
people and they make mistakes

594
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,320
they will be

595
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,919
very engaged into writing the security

596
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,799
secure code next time and

597
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,440
instead of writing code and thinking oh

598
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,840
okay i hope it's not vulnerable they

599
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,559
will come to you and ask your guidance

600
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,799
and this is exactly what you want from

601
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,559
the developers

602
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,080
and the last thing

603
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,240
you can provide learning material that

604
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,880
is relevant to the current developers

605
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,120
tasks meaning

606
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,000
let's say the development team has

607
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,159
developed management from user

608
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,080
management functionality

609
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,880
then

610
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,120
you can give them relevant material how

611
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,679
to avoid user enumeration

612
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,799
for login and passwords restoration

613
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,840
functionality and you can give some

614
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,279
advice on

615
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,520
storing the passwords

616
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,559
so be relevant and developers will come

617
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,919
to you next

618
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,880
asking your guidance

619
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,960
and finally

620
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,080
a yearly program is good only for

621
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,480
passing the audit when it's compliance

622
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
driven that's okay

623
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,039
speaking of which

624
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,240
when compliance is the only driver

625
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,480
the abstract awareness program tightly

626
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,159
won't be

627
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,159
effective

628
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,520
not only

629
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,200
the points that i've mentioned before

630
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,760
about the yearly training but also

631
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,799
employees who are forced to take the

632
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,760
training

633
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,679
will perceive it

634
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,200
as torture and the attitude towards the

635
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,240
absence or security team will become

636
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,679
negative

637
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,320
let's take a look at pros and cons of

638
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,918
the compliance driven program

639
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,039
as i've mentioned

640
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,240
it mostly fails for passing the audit

641
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,600
but

642
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,440
uh

643
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,880
if

644
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,960
you manage to

645
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,039
leverage the

646
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,880
compliance driven program that will give

647
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,960
you the completion rate of 100 percent

648
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,279
and engage developers give them

649
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,440
something interesting

650
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,320
uh it's a good head start for other apps

651
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,520
activities

652
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,960
so

653
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
if you use it

654
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,840
to give other activities not only a

655
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,799
yearly training but engage developers

656
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,600
and do things that are already said

657
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,080
it's a good thing but you need to be

658
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,679
careful with the compliance driven

659
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,440
program because you may get into the

660
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,159
swamp of giving developers the same

661
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,279
thing every year

662
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,440
and one more pitfall that is relevant

663
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,000
for the compliance driven trading

664
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,480
is when apsec

665
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,279
awareness program or absolute training

666
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,559
is done as a project with

667
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,039
an end

668
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,559
uh

669
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,600
i mean i've put training here because

670
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,320
training is something that you take and

671
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,279
it's done

672
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,320
awareness is a process

673
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,200
so

674
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,960
when you have a project that

675
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,279
ends and you just stop all the

676
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,799
activities that are related to

677
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,640
awareness program

678
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,880
you will fail because

679
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,200
at least you will give people the same

680
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,120
thing every year

681
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,000
and

682
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,080
the second time they take the training

683
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,480
they will hate you and they will

684
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,559
sabotage everything that

685
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,679
the

686
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,760
absent team does

687
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,200
and by the way

688
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,000
this is a very likely scenario when the

689
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,080
training department is in charge of the

690
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,360
task

691
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,240
so you need to make sure that absent

692
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,039
team is participating in the task

693
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,159
because the training team cannot fit it

694
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,760
cannot complete it

695
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,600
a good way so

696
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,320
what you should do

697
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,279
you should have a process as the end

698
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,240
result

699
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,720
of the project of implementing the

700
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,679
awareness program

701
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,440
the process

702
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,159
should have its owner a person who will

703
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,200
be responsible for everything happening

704
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,559
to

705
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,240
awareness

706
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,039
driving it forward

707
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,640
also you need to track progress uh

708
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,960
remember i told you that you need to

709
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,440
measure your initial state

710
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,360
if you do it then you can track progress

711
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,760
you need you can understand

712
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,320
uh what you are doing and you can show

713
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,919
it to management to prove that you're

714
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,000
doing something you're not just wasting

715
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,520
money

716
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,720
next thing you need to constantly update

717
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,600
and um and upgrade whatever you show to

718
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,279
the developers

719
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,120
showing the same thing

720
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,880
several times

721
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,760
and do it every year doesn't work you

722
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
need to show something interesting

723
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,679
something new

724
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,559
and if

725
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,960
you manage to give them the basics to

726
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,360
give developers the basics you can go

727
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,440
into slightly more

728
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
complex things that are more abstic

729
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,840
related like

730
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,559
threat modeling or risk assessment and

731
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,320
developers actually can help you with

732
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,360
that

733
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,480
so let's go back to our wasp sam and

734
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,640
take a look at the next steps next

735
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,720
maturity levels of it

736
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,200
after you've covered the basics and

737
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,679
found the security champions in the

738
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,279
development teams

739
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,080
you can go into the framework specifics

740
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,720
the language specifics

741
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,360
try to involve developers in the

742
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,440
security activities teach the most

743
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,039
willing of them

744
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,279
the absolute things like risk assessment

745
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,760
and threat modeling

746
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,159
and one more important thing that you

747
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,440
need to do

748
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,200
is measure

749
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,279
your success and measure

750
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,159
what you do measure your progress

751
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,600
it's even

752
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,960
one of the

753
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,559
uh practices that os sam shows

754
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,640
measuring your

755
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,520
absence program it also has several

756
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,000
maturity levels

757
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,640
there's a lot of what you can do after

758
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,360
you

759
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,120
give

760
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,760
some training to developers

761
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,760
and your main goal is not to stop

762
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,480
so

763
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,159
that's it and let's wrap up with

764
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,399
pointing the things that that you can

765
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,600
take away from the stock

766
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,200
first

767
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,679
you need to get the necessary support

768
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,760
from management and development

769
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,720
getting the support that you need

770
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,600
you can allocate enough people and time

771
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,799
and priorities into the task

772
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,440
so you can make it continuous you can

773
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,840
devote it enough time

774
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,760
to engage and interest developers into

775
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,480
the appsec activities

776
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
so that's it thank you for your

777
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,880
attention here's my twitter in case you

778
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,919
need to tell me something
