00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,840
hello my name is marina kelly welcome to

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,480
my presentation using the oauth top 10

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,160
as the foundation for security and

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,679
privacy programs across your

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,200
organization

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,960
i'm a technical director and data

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,200
protection officer for cyber security

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,680
training company so let's jump right

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,160
into it

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,720
security and privacy programs are

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,039
essential for organizations

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,039
however creating and maintaining these

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,000
programs comes with challenges

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
organizations require compliance with

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,800
multiple industry and or government

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,280
standards and protocols

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,760
continuous innovation brings constant

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,239
considerations for security and privacy

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,879
on top of changing standards and goals

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,280
is challenging

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,440
standards and regulations can be

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,640
disjointed and at times seem almost

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,640
contradictory

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,359
so i'm a details person i read the

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,280
footnotes and books nutritional

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,080
information on food packaging and even

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,240
the full text of eula's

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
one of my favorite sentences from the

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,479
owass top 10 2017

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,520
is often overlooked and is it not a

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
specific vulnerability or risk

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,840
it's from the fifth paragraph on the

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,920
opening page right beside the table of

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,119
contents

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,680
it speaks to application security but i

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,360
believe it should be expanded to cover

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,520
security and privacy programs in any

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,600
organization

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,520
we advocate approaching application

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,759
security as a people

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,479
process and technology problem because

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,079
the most effective approaches to

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,399
application security require

44
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,920
improvements in these areas

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,720
these 24 simple words from form the

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,240
basis of today's presentation

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,719
gdpr ccpa

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,320
pci

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,479
iso and so on

50
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,479
the number of acronyms and the security

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,640
and privacy frameworks they represent

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
continue to grow

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,160
with each new standard comes the

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,840
governance headaches

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,040
who needs to know what when and do what

56
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,480
when

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,080
getting your arms around all these is

58
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,200
essential but it is not simple

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,080
the cost of not doing so can be high a

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,120
combination of fines lost productivity

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,160
legal fees remediation costs training

62
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,680
costs lost revenue and more

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,599
you must know the security and privacy

64
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,599
related initiatives your organization is

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,280
responsible for

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,040
these can be based on a variety of

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,519
factors such as the data you hold and

68
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,560
process

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,879
your location the location of your

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,440
clients the size of your company and

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,879
your industry

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,879
you may only have one of these which you

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,280
must address but it's more likely that

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,920
you will have several of these

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,680
each of these comes with its own

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,840
structure terminology and expected

77
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,239
results however before you go off and

78
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,000
start creating a program for each

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,200
initiative

80
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,879
stop and think

81
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,800
one of the most important ways of

82
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
ensuring that security and training

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,480
programs will be more than a check the

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,959
box structure and will actually improve

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,360
security and privacy is to avoid silos

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,799
when we develop these programs

87
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,040
individually we risk redundancy and gaps

88
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,720
in many instances

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,120
your development teams may be the ones

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,599
hardest hit with unnecessary or

91
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,159
ineffective documentation and training

92
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,760
[Music]

93
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,080
so how do we avoid these security and

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
privacy silos

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,239
the key to success is to take a step

96
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,879
back and look for the commonalities of

97
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,319
governance

98
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,959
what do these standards regulations

99
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,760
frameworks and protocols share that can

100
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,599
be used to build a simple governance

101
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,840
structure that meets the requirements

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,000
across the board

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,920
how do we find these commonalities and

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,080
build on them to create effective and

105
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,319
efficient programs

106
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,400
i suggest that a perfect foundation for

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,279
this planning is the owasp top 10.

108
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,079
the oauth's top 10 focuses first and

109
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,240
foremost on data

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,919
and it's protection

111
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,720
a trait it shares with all security and

112
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
privacy initiatives

113
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,120
because of this focus it provides

114
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,360
extensive coverage of common areas of

115
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,919
weakness and vulnerability in multiple

116
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,280
aspects of the entire security

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,120
and privacy landscape of an organization

118
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,440
owasp is more than just a vetted listing

119
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,280
of common risks and vulnerabilities

120
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,919
because its depth and its basis in

121
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,040
research as well as applicability in all

122
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,360
types of development environments

123
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,080
owasp serves as an anchor from which to

124
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
launch your planning and design of a

125
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,560
singular governance and compliance

126
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,199
operation

127
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,120
so today i want to crosswalk five

128
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
popular security and property and

129
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,520
privacy initiatives many of you may

130
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,880
recognize

131
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,039
to see how the oauth top 10 can provide

132
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,080
support

133
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
direction and content for their

134
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
implementation

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,919
this will not be a deep dive into each

136
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,400
one but more of an introduction to how

137
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,479
you can use a unified approach to

138
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,680
simplify and align multiple programs

139
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,600
so let's crosswalk

140
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,360
secure by design

141
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,280
privacy by design

142
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,160
the general data protection requirement

143
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,800
california consumer protection act

144
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,560
and the international organization of

145
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,360
standards

146
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,440
27001 information security management

147
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,840
standard

148
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,160
secure by design is a standard in which

149
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,919
good software design principles are

150
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,639
combined with a security mindset using

151
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,840
patterns and best

152
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,440
practices every decision made about the

153
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,720
design

154
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,919
planning

155
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,319
architecting building

156
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,560
testing deployment

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,800
and maintenance should be driven by a

158
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
simple question

159
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,199
is this secure

160
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,199
this means that everyone involved with

161
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,120
the creation of a web application

162
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,440
website or web service

163
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,319
your business analysts designers

164
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,960
testers program managers product

165
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,160
managers support staff as well as your

166
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,360
developers

167
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,600
should have security at the forefront of

168
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,199
their decision making processes

169
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,520
the key risk that secure by design helps

170
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,840
to battle is security as an afterthought

171
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,280
designing for security from the

172
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,520
beginning helps to avoid the scatter

173
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,319
shot process of catching and killing

174
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,759
bugs as they are found in the wild

175
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,520
secure by design has come to the

176
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,440
forefront in recent years with the

177
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,240
explosion of development for internet of

178
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,120
things devices

179
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,960
there are guiding principles that we use

180
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
to implement secure by design in the

181
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,560
development arena

182
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,240
these principles are shared and

183
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
supported by the olaf's top 10 through

184
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,960
its suggested prevention and mitigation

185
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,479
strategies

186
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,560
so let's look at these two standards to

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
see how they align and focus on how

188
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,080
using owasp can help to support secure

189
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,719
by design

190
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
so here's an example of a matrix that i

191
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,160
created that can be used when comparing

192
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
and contrasting two security and or

193
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,560
privacy related standards

194
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,639
down the left hand side are the secure

195
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,360
by design principles well across the top

196
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,280
are the 10 vulnerabilities outlined in

197
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,599
the oas top 10 2017 version

198
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,360
where there is a correlation between the

199
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,520
two an x is placed at the intersection

200
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,919
as you will see the oauth top 10

201
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,840
directly correlates with all of the

202
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,800
guiding principles of secure by design

203
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
so let's examine the alignment of these

204
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,319
two

205
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,639
so first up we have keep security simple

206
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,080
owasp

207
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,400
emphasizes the use of the simplest

208
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,960
methods possible to address security

209
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,039
vulnerabilities to make code more easily

210
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,960
maintainable and risk easier to spot

211
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,199
a perfect example of this

212
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,159
is a recommendation to use less complex

213
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,159
data formats that are contained within

214
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,958
the mitigation strategies for xml

215
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,880
external entities

216
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,919
so we want to avoid using overly complex

217
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,919
coding approaches for security

218
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,399
minimize the attack surface area

219
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,720
lower your security risk by reducing the

220
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,760
size of the attack surface area

221
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,360
shrinking the size of your attack

222
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,080
surface area is one of the quickest most

223
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,240
cost effective means of improving your

224
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,200
organization's security stature and it

225
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,839
is thoroughly supported by the oas top

226
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,000
10.

227
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
separation of duties

228
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,000
create roles with differing levels of

229
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,680
trust to which a user is assigned

230
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,160
broken authentication and broken access

231
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,800
control in the oas top 10 are great

232
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,360
examples of the direct support for the

233
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,240
idea of separation of duties

234
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
if you are working in transactional

235
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,399
environments separation of duties is

236
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,240
mandated by best practices

237
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,040
use principle of least privilege

238
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
only give access to the information a

239
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,360
person needs to do their job

240
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,440
principle of least privilege goes hand

241
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,720
in hand with separation of duties

242
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,959
broken access controls and using

243
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,959
components with known vulnerabilities

244
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,519
specifically emphasize principle of

245
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,360
least privilege as a mitigation strategy

246
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,200
principle of least privilege is also

247
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,279
another means of minimizing your attack

248
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,839
surface area

249
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,360
use principle of defense in depth

250
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,760
the idea behind defense and depth is

251
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
that multiple levels of controls that

252
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,720
focus on different type of risks offer

253
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,959
the best defense

254
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,760
all aspects of the os top 10 encourage

255
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,160
the use of multiple control levels to

256
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,839
provide the best mitigation

257
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,200
fail securely

258
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,440
software applications will fail to

259
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,760
process some transactions it's just a

260
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,519
fact of life

261
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,279
your users will fail occasionally to

262
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,399
follow best practices and security

263
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,560
when this occurs the system should be

264
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,519
able to protect users and data by being

265
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,040
fault tolerant

266
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,360
failing over to a secure state in which

267
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,920
an exception is thrown and a decision is

268
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,839
awaited

269
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,240
all mitigation strategies in the oas top

270
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,640
10 have at their core the idea of

271
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,720
failing securely

272
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,800
mechanisms to default to a fail-safe

273
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,279
state to protect data are encouraged

274
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,839
do not trust

275
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,399
services many web applications websites

276
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,720
and web services are developed using

277
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
third-party components

278
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,760
developers should not trust the default

279
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,839
configurations of these

280
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,680
and always review an update

281
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
since any of the vulnerabilities listed

282
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,320
in the owasp top 10 can occur due to the

283
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,720
use of third-party components

284
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,800
reviews of the security settings of all

285
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,240
services are a must

286
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,920
avoid security by obscurity

287
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,560
in development security obscurity means

288
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,959
trusting that a simple change such as

289
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,440
using encryption or enforcing secrecy

290
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
and confidentiality of the system's

291
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,600
internal design architecture

292
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
and its flaws

293
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,760
is enough to protect your data

294
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,240
we know from numerous examples that this

295
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,519
old school security trick does not work

296
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,279
developers must

297
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,760
think like the enemy and assume the

298
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,560
worst as is encouraged in the o wasp top

299
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,800
ten

300
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,000
fix security issues correctly

301
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,560
once an issue is found you must research

302
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,639
to determine the full impact

303
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,399
fix it completely and test that fix

304
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,399
this is one of the founding platforms of

305
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,240
the owasp top 10.

306
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,639
a repeatable change management process

307
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,000
is key to strong security

308
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,000
using the same metrics matrix structure

309
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,680
let's now look at privacy by design

310
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,800
so what is privacy by design as noted by

311
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,600
deloitte privacy by design is a

312
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,079
framework based on proactively embedding

313
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,120
privacy into the design and operation of

314
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,720
i.t systems

315
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,120
networked infrastructure and business

316
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,639
practices

317
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,720
it is a risk-based approach which

318
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,200
anticipates risks and designs counter

319
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
measures to respond

320
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,519
it is designed to address multiple data

321
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,200
privacy requirements across

322
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,560
jurisdictions in an increasingly complex

323
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
and connected world

324
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,279
it is also known as data protection by

325
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,279
design or data protection by default

326
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,440
as with secure by design

327
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,279
everyone involved in the creation of a

328
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,760
web application website or web service

329
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,800
should have privacy at the forefront of

330
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,560
their decision-making processes

331
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,360
privacy by design is gaining traction as

332
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,440
we see new data privacy laws and

333
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
regulations being rolled out across the

334
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
globe

335
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
just as we saw with secure by design

336
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,320
there are guiding principles that we use

337
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,560
to implement privacy by design that are

338
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,160
supported by the owasp standard

339
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,839
so let's take a look at the crosswalk

340
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,240
between these two standards and focus on

341
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,680
how using owasp can help to implement

342
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,880
privacy by design

343
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,360
so as you'll see the oauth top 10 also

344
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
directly correlates with all of the

345
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,360
guiding principles of privacy by design

346
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,480
so let's examine this alignment

347
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,839
first of all

348
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,480
proactive not reactive

349
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,680
preventative not remedial

350
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,360
anticipate identify and prevent invasive

351
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,560
events before they occur

352
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,320
the belief that vulnerabilities are

353
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,560
preventable with proper development

354
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
processes

355
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,240
drives the creation of the oauth top 10

356
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,040
so it is a natural fit with privacy by

357
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,439
design

358
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,800
privacy as the default setting

359
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,720
personal data should be automatically

360
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,519
protected in all its systems or business

361
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,199
practices

362
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,760
no added actions should be required by

363
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,560
any individual whether an administrator

364
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
or a user

365
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,120
owasp takes a risk-based approach to

366
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,440
addressing security vulnerabilities

367
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,680
by doing so it aligns with best

368
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,000
practices in relation to privacy

369
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,920
privacy embedded into design

370
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,519
privacy measures should be fully

371
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,839
integrated components of systems

372
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,800
never add-ons

373
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,639
using a secure coding standard like the

374
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,199
owasp top 10 helps to ensure that

375
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,519
privacy is rooted into the core of every

376
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,720
application website or service you build

377
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,360
or implement

378
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,519
full functionality

379
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,800
positive some not zero-sum

380
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,279
both privacy and security are important

381
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,600
and no unnecessary trade-offs and system

382
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,160
design goals need to be made to achieve

383
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,000
both

384
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,240
a logical fallacy that we often see

385
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,560
argued in development is that you must

386
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,600
choose between privacy and security

387
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,519
it's simply not true

388
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,680
you can achieve both for a win-win

389
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,320
situation using the oauth top 10 to

390
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,160
ensure that both are supported

391
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,399
ensure end-to-end security

392
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,519
full system life cycle protection

393
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,920
data should be secured throughout its

394
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,360
life cycle

395
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,000
all data should be securely retained as

396
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,560
needed and destroyed when it's no longer

397
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,240
needed the oats top 10 represents risk

398
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,320
across all aspects of the development

399
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,000
life cycle

400
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,880
using it as a foundation ensures this

401
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,399
end-to-end security

402
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,120
visibility and transparency

403
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,360
keep it open

404
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,680
stakeholders should be assured that

405
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,160
business practices and technologies are

406
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
operating according to objectives and

407
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,839
subject to independent

408
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,000
verification the oauth top 10 in concert

409
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
with a strong application security and

410
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,480
privacy initiative will help to provide

411
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,559
stakeholders with assurances that both

412
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,439
security and privacy controls have been

413
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,640
thoroughly designed executed and tested

414
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,079
in a repeatable

415
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,959
risk-based process

416
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,480
and finally respect for user privacy

417
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,799
keep it user-centric

418
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,880
individual privacy interest must be

419
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,600
supported by strong privacy defaults

420
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,840
appropriate notice and user-friendly

421
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,600
options

422
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
a crucial means of showing your

423
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,559
organization's respect for user privacy

424
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,720
is securing their data

425
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,160
especially critical and sensitive data

426
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,280
using os top 10

427
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,520
in the avoidance of the most common risk

428
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,000
to security and privacy will help to

429
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,799
further that goal

430
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,559
so now that we've seen two

431
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,039
we've seen how to crosswalk to find

432
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,520
commonalities between the os top 10 and

433
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,160
secure by design and privacy by design

434
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,600
frameworks

435
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,440
let's now look at how we can perform a

436
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,919
similar exercise to support requirements

437
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,120
within regulations and laws

438
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,559
we'll start with the general data

439
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,559
protection regulation or gdpr

440
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,520
gdpr a european union digital privacy

441
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,039
law came into effect in may of 2018.

442
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,520
it's a comprehensive law it includes

443
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,679
numerous specific regulations for the

444
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,840
implementation of data security

445
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,480
including record keeping auditing

446
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,960
reporting the notification of data

447
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,120
breaches to regulators and affected

448
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,000
individuals and the transferring of data

449
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,880
across eu borders to protect sensitive

450
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,960
data such as health records

451
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,679
bioinformatic data banking and credit

452
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,200
information and intellectual property

453
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,000
it applies to organizations inside and

454
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,480
outside the eu who provide goods and

455
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,559
services to those residing within the eu

456
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,440
it contains 99 articles and numerous

457
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
recitals

458
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,039
but today i just want to focus on a very

459
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,840
specific article number 25

460
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,000
data protection by design and default

461
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,640
article 25 requires organizations to

462
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,559
implement appropriate technical and

463
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,440
organizational measures such as

464
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,799
pseudonymization which are designed to

465
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,960
implement data protection principles

466
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,039
such as data minimization

467
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,880
in an effective manner and to integrate

468
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,440
the necessary safeguards into the

469
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,039
processing in order to meet the

470
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,200
requirements of this regulation and

471
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,400
protect the rights of data subjects

472
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,720
in other words it obligates an

473
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,960
organization that handles personal data

474
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,679
of subjects to protect data through

475
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,600
technology design

476
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,200
gdpr was one of the first laws to codify

477
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,480
the idea of the right to be forgotten

478
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,440
also known as the right to erasure

479
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,080
except in specific circumstances an

480
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,159
individual has the right to request an

481
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,159
organization to lead all personal data

482
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,520
that it holds

483
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,559
in order to do so an organization must

484
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,400
be able to determine where an

485
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,840
individual's data is held at all times

486
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,400
that it is held securely that it can be

487
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,880
removed from systems and that removal

488
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,760
can be certified without undue delay

489
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
all of these require that design

490
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,679
decisions be made from the beginning of

491
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,280
development and that common

492
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,679
vulnerabilities that place data at risk

493
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,520
be avoided

494
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
this includes lawful fair and

495
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,600
transparent processing

496
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,320
purpose limitation and storage in a form

497
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,679
that allows for identification

498
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,440
as we saw with secure by design and

499
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,159
privacy by design data security and

500
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,480
privacy must be incorporated from the

501
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,200
start of processing data

502
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,720
thus article 25 aligns with the os top

503
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,559
10 as well as os proactive controls

504
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,480
they can be used as guidance in

505
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,559
implementing the required controls to

506
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,760
ensure data protection by design and

507
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,240
default

508
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
let's now look and see

509
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,159
the the same exercise but apply it to a

510
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,400
more recent digital privacy law which

511
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,520
came into effect this year

512
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,720
the california consumer privacy act or

513
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,159
ccpa

514
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,320
is a law specifically aimed at

515
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,720
for-profit businesses that meet a

516
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,200
threshold set in relation to annual

517
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,960
gross profits

518
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,280
number of personal data records and the

519
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,679
percentage of profit generated by sales

520
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,799
of consumers personal data

521
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,840
the law covers a consumer who is a

522
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,400
natural person who is a california

523
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,919
resident

524
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,880
the law focuses on collecting of the

525
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,120
consumer's personal information

526
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,400
and that is buying renting gathering

527
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,400
obtaining receiving or accessing any

528
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,080
personal information pertaining to a

529
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,960
consumer by any means

530
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,200
and it places restrictions on how that

531
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,600
information is handled

532
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,400
it also covers the selling of personal

533
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,280
data

534
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,320
which is defined as renting disclosing

535
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,000
releasing disseminating making available

536
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,559
transferring or otherwise communicating

537
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,120
personal information for monetary or

538
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,158
other valuable considerations

539
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,120
the ccpa grants a consumer four basic

540
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,720
rights

541
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,960
the right to access user-friendly

542
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,000
versions of all data held on that data

543
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,520
subject

544
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,000
the right to opt out of data being sold

545
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,240
to a third party

546
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,000
the right to deletion of personal data

547
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,559
and the right to equal access and

548
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,399
pricing for services

549
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,720
due to the nature of the ccpa

550
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,559
there are numerous development

551
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,640
considerations that are brought to the

552
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,080
table

553
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,799
there must be a cradle to grave approach

554
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,159
in relation to consumers personal data

555
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,240
as we saw with gdpr

556
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,559
we must know at all times where an

557
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,480
individual's data is

558
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,240
and be able to extract it from systems

559
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,320
there are numerous commonalities of

560
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,399
governance that can be leveraged

561
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,279
compliance with gdpr does not imply

562
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,720
compliance with ccpa and vice versa

563
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,400
although they do share some common

564
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,799
traits there are specific differences

565
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,279
that require consideration

566
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,320
however we can see that both do share a

567
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,880
necessity for websites applications and

568
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,279
services that ensure security and

569
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,400
privacy from the ground up

570
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,200
using the os top 10 to support secure

571
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,760
coding can be a vital component for your

572
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,080
overall compliance with these types of

573
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,720
laws and regulations

574
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,760
we've looked at examples of frameworks

575
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,279
and regulations with the oaus top ten

576
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,520
now we'll switch gears and look at how

577
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,320
we can crosswalk the os top 10 with a

578
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,080
common certification standard

579
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,320
the iso

580
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,880
27001 defines a set of requirements for

581
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,320
information security management systems

582
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,960
the standard obligates an organization

583
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
to examine its information security

584
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,480
risks

585
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,279
threats and vulnerabilities and the

586
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,600
impact of each

587
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,080
the organization must then assess the

588
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,400
risk and determine its risk management

589
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,520
plan

590
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,480
based on its level of risk tolerance are

591
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,600
you going to avoid accept or mitigate

592
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,520
the risk

593
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,679
they must create and implement

594
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,640
information security controls to address

595
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
the risk management plan

596
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,559
and to ensure that the controls are

597
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,559
maintained as changes occur in the

598
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,919
organization over time

599
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,480
unlike secure by design and privacy by

600
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,600
design

601
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,120
its focus is on all data

602
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,080
and it's confidentiality integrity and

603
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,840
accessibility

604
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,520
not just sensitive information

605
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,799
let's look specifically at an annex of

606
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,360
the iso 27001

607
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,559
a

608
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,960
14.2

609
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,279
security and development and support

610
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,039
processes

611
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,679
which directly addresses the development

612
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,520
component of information management

613
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,360
systems

614
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,159
this annex contains nine controls

615
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,039
related to how information security is

616
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,640
designed and implemented within the sdlc

617
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,400
of systems

618
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,039
a purpose it shares with the owasp top

619
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,960
10.

620
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
so we're going to do a quick dive into

621
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,279
each and look at an example of how the

622
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,919
owasp top 10 can be applied to that

623
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,679
control

624
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,679
so we'll start with number one

625
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,799
secure development policy

626
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,440
the oauth application security standard

627
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,760
can serve as one of the cornerstones of

628
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,480
a secure development policy which

629
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,360
focuses on avoiding common technical

630
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,279
vulnerabilities

631
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,600
because the owasp top 10 is a platform

632
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,159
and language agnostic standard

633
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,880
using it as a basis for your secure

634
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,760
development policy allows for addressing

635
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,039
specific development languages and tools

636
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,360
as needed by your organization

637
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,919
while maintaining cohesiveness across

638
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,760
multiple development groups in the

639
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,480
organization

640
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,039
two system change control

641
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,200
identifying and checking security

642
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,679
critical code for vulnerabilities

643
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,279
whether those vulnerabilities are

644
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,240
accidental or deliberate

645
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,480
is a crucial aspect of system change

646
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,399
control and is embedded within the owasp

647
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,199
top 10.

648
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,480
third

649
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,039
technical review of applications after

650
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,000
operating platform changes

651
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,320
the interconnectedness of systems means

652
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,640
that we get a ripple effect when we make

653
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,279
changes to platforms

654
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,840
mitigation strategies in the top 10

655
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,559
include reviewing application controls

656
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,360
and integrity procedures after changes

657
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,719
to critical systems

658
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:52,720
four

659
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,120
restrictions on changes to software

660
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,200
packages

661
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,679
ensuring the internal integrity and

662
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,480
security of applications sites and

663
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,679
services

664
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,000
requires restrictions on making changes

665
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,320
to software packages and components that

666
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,240
are strictly controlled

667
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,159
as indicated in the top 10.

668
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,360
number five

669
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,279
secure system engineering principles

670
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,520
secure engineering techniques such as

671
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,760
the ones offered in relation to the os

672
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,200
top ten

673
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,520
help an organization define programs

674
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,480
specific

675
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,960
to secure engineering principles

676
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,120
secure development environment

677
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,520
the owasp application security standard

678
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,279
provides guidance on standard

679
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,679
requirements for a secure development

680
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,480
environment such as isolation and

681
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,159
development environments from production

682
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,600
environments

683
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,799
and audits

684
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,480
outsource development

685
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,640
development processes should include

686
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,480
adherence to the same secure development

687
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,720
policies as are enforced within the

688
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,240
organization

689
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,399
and to secure coding standards as

690
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,840
outlined in the top ten

691
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,679
system security testing number eight

692
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,159
security testing must occur throughout

693
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,039
development and prior to introduction of

694
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,320
code to a production environment

695
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,799
the os top 10 and its

696
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,039
and its related application security

697
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,039
verification standard

698
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,440
can be used as touch tones for your

699
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,000
testing program

700
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,559
and finally number nine system

701
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,559
acceptance testing

702
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,039
penetration testing prior to final

703
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,320
acceptance of systems and updates is a

704
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,799
critical final step in security testing

705
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,799
for information security management

706
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,320
systems the oauth top 10 and its sister

707
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,799
project the offensive web testing

708
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,200
framework are excellent documented

709
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,960
foundations for penetration testing

710
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,360
we've noted

711
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,679
having to implement and maintain

712
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,080
multiple initiatives can be challenging

713
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,320
as you can see by the scope of just the

714
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,880
five we've covered today

715
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
success relies on knowing the

716
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,279
requirements and how they apply to your

717
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,440
organization

718
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,840
today we have crosswalk five common

719
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,159
security and privacy initiatives that

720
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,320
many organizations face

721
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,240
secure by design privacy by design gdpr

722
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,720
ccpa and iso 27001

723
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,279
our purpose in doing so was to model how

724
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,720
you can find commonalities of governance

725
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,880
and by using this information to avoid

726
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,600
silos build a comprehensive security

727
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,840
privacy program

728
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,760
when you do so there can be several

729
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,679
advantages

730
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,080
we can lower our costs in time and

731
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,559
resources needed to manage and remain

732
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,279
compliant by using this information to

733
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,840
create unified documentation and

734
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,159
training plans

735
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,240
we can provide employees with the

736
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,279
information necessary to them as opposed

737
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,600
to taking a scatter shot approach so

738
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,360
they are reading less and doing more

739
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,440
we can use these commonalities to build

740
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,159
an overall security and privacy mindset

741
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,159
in your organization

742
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,559
thus providing stronger assurances that

743
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,000
employees and clients are protected

744
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,080
and finally we can battle the image that

745
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,000
development teams are siloed in the

746
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,960
organization and reinforce the important

747
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,279
role they play in the overall security

748
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,399
stature of an organization

749
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,279
thank you for your time and

750
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,840
consideration i hope these ideas help to

751
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,600
stimulate your thinking in ways that you

752
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,399
can use the oauth top 10 as a

753
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,480
cornerstone for the creation and growth

754
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,240
of your security and property and

755
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,399
privacy initiatives please feel free to

756
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,120
contact me with any questions good luck

757
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,600
and stay safe
