1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,480
hi my name is brian reed and i'm the

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,560
chief mobility officer at now secure and

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,879
with me today is my partner tony ramirez

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,480
also of now secure

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,000
we're going to talk about how the latest

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,360
masvs and mstg specs make the best

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,519
mobile pen testing cocktails

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,119
now little story about this session

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,039
we're originally expecting to be at the

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,720
end of the day so we thought we'd make

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,279
it fun with drinks at the end of the day

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,119
now it's a virtual conference but we

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,039
encourage you to grab your favorite

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,679
drink in the background and drink while

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,159
we talk and teach you about me svs and

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,680
mstg

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,680
so a bit about me i'm chief mobility

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,520
officer here at now secure i've been

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,440
here for about 15 years i was here at

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,280
the birth of modern mobile security

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,360
around blackberry and have been working

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
with mobile technology companies and

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,000
mobile customers for decades

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,800
my favorite drink today is a whistle pig

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,160
old fashioned and again as i said

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,840
earlier we encourage to bring yours

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,239
along for this journey

28
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,920
now a little bit about our background

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,600
here so we've been doing mobile pen

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,199
testing and mobile forensics for over a

31
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,399
decade and worked with some of the

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,559
largest mobile companies odds are pretty

33
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,159
good you've used one or more mobile

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,680
applications that have been secured

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,880
using our best practices our technology

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,720
our security research team is well

37
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,280
renowned they created tools like frida

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,600
and radari you see at the bottom here

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,200
that are very frequently used by

40
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,439
advanced mobile pen testers in advanced

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,960
mobile researchers

42
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,320
and we're excited to be one of the

43
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,479
founding enablers and creators of the

44
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,439
owasp mobile project as well

45
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,799
and so as part of that journey i'm going

46
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,079
to start us out today a little bit

47
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,520
looking at what's been happening at

48
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,119
mobile now over the last couple of years

49
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,119
since i presented last time

50
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,040
it's really amazing to see things like

51
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,360
augmented reality where you can over

52
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,920
overlap mind map on top of a photo

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,240
digital payments are obviously there i

54
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
happen to have a tesla and i can summon

55
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,360
it to me and we just saw the

56
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,680
announcements with apple and bmw on car

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,079
keys i have an aura health ring i use

58
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,159
that to track and monitor my health and

59
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,560
many more innovations have occurred

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,159
and so as we think about it the reality

61
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,960
today is that 70 of all digital traffic

62
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,719
and all digital time spent on the

63
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,960
internet is actually spent in mobile

64
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,840
and so many security analysts security

65
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,599
researchers that we work with come from

66
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,040
the web world and have started in the

67
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,200
web world and may not have realized that

68
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,080
mobile actually dominates usage now and

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,319
so everybody wants a great high secure

70
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,120
easy to use application but the reality

71
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,760
is when you benchmark mobile data and we

72
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,319
benchmark millions of apps in

73
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,160
the apple app store in google play to

74
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,920
give us these statistics you find that

75
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,640
about 85 percent of those apps fail one

76
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,120
or more of the owasp top ten seventy

77
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,080
percent of them leak gdpr and for most

78
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,920
organizations mobile security testing is

79
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,080
a very brittle experience and for most

80
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
organizations it's really hard to find

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,400
mobile security analysts for you and

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,160
your career it's a great opportunity to

83
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,480
make some money by growing skills around

84
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,440
mobile

85
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,760
now if we carve up the oauth top 10 what

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,400
you'll actually find is uh m2 and m3

87
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,440
tend to be the highest failures so 50 of

88
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,720
the mobile apps we've tested have

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,959
insecure data storage and 48

90
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,959
have insecure communication

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,440
and nearly half have extremable

92
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,120
extraneous functionality that's actually

93
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,319
exploitable

94
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,200
m9 which is also a bad thing and so what

95
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,080
we realized on this journey is that uh

96
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
the testing capabilities that

97
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,920
organizations have from the skills to

98
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,080
the tooling has largely been lacking as

99
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,000
people have moved from web to mobile so

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
i want to just spend a minute here

101
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
talking about web to mobile and attack

102
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,400
surface and i'm going to hand it over to

103
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,360
tony

104
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
so when we think about webb it's

105
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,519
inherently secure to a degree from the

106
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,519
perspective that 98 of the code is

107
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,599
behind a hard-coded perimeter and really

108
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,280
heavily defended now that doesn't mean

109
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,480
there aren't vulnerabilities and that

110
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,159
doesn't mean that cross-site scripting

111
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,000
doesn't happen all the time but that's

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,280
an architectural design paradigm versus

113
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,720
mobile where the majority of the code

114
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,159
actually lives on a mobile app that

115
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
lives on a mobile device that device is

116
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,480
not hardened it's in the wild it's easy

117
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,840
to reverse as we're going to show you

118
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,080
today and so the architectural

119
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,720
differences create a broader attack

120
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,159
surface that is easier to attack frankly

121
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,760
than a website and that means mobile

122
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,560
application security testing skills and

123
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,000
tooling have to advance pretty

124
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
substantially in order to understand

125
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,280
that difference

126
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,639
and so that starts with understanding

127
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,079
the mobile attack surface and we're

128
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,680
going to learn more about this in our 10

129
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,839
best practices and the mobile attack

130
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,680
surface spans not just code

131
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,840
functionality which is traditionally

132
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,440
what we look at from a web security

133
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,600
testing perspective it actually spans

134
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,919
data at rest data and motion in the api

135
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,919
back ends so if you think about testing

136
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,520
a mobile app it's already running in a

137
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,360
browser that browser is inherently

138
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
secure and hopefully you're using ssl so

139
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,720
the network connection is inherently

140
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
secure and hopefully it's connecting to

141
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
secure back ends but when you have a

142
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,919
mobile app it's running on the wild on

143
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,440
this device and that means a developer

144
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,160
has to understand how to securely store

145
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
data for data at rest you have to

146
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
understand how to write the code to

147
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,400
secure the network connections and

148
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,160
manage things like certificates and

149
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,759
hostname validation and a whole lot of

150
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,479
skill set they typically don't have

151
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,080
and so let's take a quick look at the

152
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,680
anatomy of a mobile attack and then

153
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
let's look at how to prevent it so what

154
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,360
the bad guys do and what you could do as

155
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
a security researcher is you could

156
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,479
surveil the mobile app so you get the

157
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,759
binary whether you're downloading it

158
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,120
from an app store or somewhere else in

159
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
the world download it reverse it grab

160
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,039
our favorite tool radari and frida and

161
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,320
tear it apart there's lots of other

162
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,080
tools you can do it as well

163
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,759
and then a security analyst will

164
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,440
interactively manipulate the inputs and

165
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,600
the outputs to figure out what it does

166
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
and along the way they almost always

167
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,320
like 99 of the time find pii that they

168
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,479
can harvest on the device or over the

169
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,479
network and they also get to map all the

170
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,320
end points by running the application

171
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,919
and seeing where it goes

172
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,240
it's not uncommon like 48 percent of

173
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,400
applications will find a network issue

174
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,320
they discover a cert validation failure

175
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
and guess what that means they can now

176
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
create a phishing endpoint attack on the

177
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
application we've seen it many times we

178
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,240
often build them as pocs to help

179
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,759
developers understand what they're doing

180
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,680
wrong now they can harvest credentials

181
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,440
they can redirect payment all kinds of

182
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,199
bad things right and i'm not here to say

183
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,120
this guy is falling i'm really here to

184
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,600
introduce tony and tony's going to walk

185
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,919
you through a more detailed analysis of

186
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,560
understanding what the mas vs is and how

187
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,400
you can use it in your organization

188
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,120
all right an amount on part one

189
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,840
oh crud i forgot he had an intro slide

190
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,319
for him all right um i'm going to go

191
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,160
ahead and do 30 seconds on this and

192
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,520
hopefully you can

193
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,680
slam it on the out uh actually let's do

194
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,319
this let's go back because i end uh no

195
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,160
you can you find that cut are you

196
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,039
cutting it for me

197
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
okay

198
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
i'll do the last two

199
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,479
yeah i'm just gonna do this one and this

200
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,240
one let me just go look i just yeah

201
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,479
there you go i was anticipating tony had

202
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,479
added that because he thought it hooked

203
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,800
it so anyway i'm gonna go do the

204
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,240
understand the anatomy of mobile attack

205
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,520
so we'll kill the other one we'll do

206
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
this i'll do two slides we're done in

207
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,880
about 60 seconds

208
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,160
all right

209
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,280
here we go

210
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,680
uh five four three

211
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
so let's take a look at the anatomy of

212
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,639
an attack to really gain the better

213
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,240
understanding and then we'll dig in in

214
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
the mas vs to figure out how to test

215
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,960
this

216
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,560
and so what the bad guys will do or what

217
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
a good security researcher will do is

218
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,759
surveil the mobile app download it from

219
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,680
the app stores and reverse it it's easy

220
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,080
to reverse with r2freedo hook it and you

221
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,360
can pretty quickly figure out what's

222
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,440
going on even an apple app that might

223
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,240
have drm really can be cracked and then

224
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,840
they'll interactively manipulate it and

225
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,039
they're going to start to discover

226
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,800
something and what we find is about 99

227
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,560
percent of apps leak some kind of

228
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,360
personal data maybe it's just gps or

229
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,120
advertiser id but maybe it's something

230
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,280
else scary and in this interaction what

231
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,639
they're going to discover is they can

232
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,759
map all the api back-end endpoints so

233
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,759
now they have intelligence on your ip

234
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,599
some of your pii and how it's connecting

235
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,599
to the back end and more often than not

236
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,360
about 50 of the time they'll discover

237
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,879
there's a networking issue that they can

238
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,800
then use as an attack surface and

239
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,199
exploit and so they might redirect to a

240
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,039
phishing endpoint and now they can

241
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,280
basically harvest credentials or payment

242
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,960
or some other kind of information we've

243
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
seen this happen for real in the wild

244
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,479
our security analysts and researchers

245
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,160
often use this with developers to teach

246
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,919
them how this happens leads to bad

247
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,520
things like account takeover and all the

248
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
rest so i'm not here to say this guy is

249
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
falling i'm saying that the anatomy of

250
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,319
mobile attack and what's actually

251
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,800
exploitable on a mobile application is

252
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,360
bigger wider and more complex than web

253
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,919
and that's why the mas and mstg exist

254
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,360
and that's why we're talking to you

255
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,800
today

256
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
and so you know if we think about every

257
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,639
application is created different then

258
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,799
testing each app is like mixing your own

259
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,399
cocktail so we're gonna have some fun

260
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,919
with drinks and mixing drinks and

261
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,200
talking about the mas vs and the mstg as

262
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,559
we go through

263
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,039
tony's top ten

264
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,959
hey folks i'm tony ramirez senior

265
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,640
application security analyst at now

266
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,720
secure i've been now secure for a little

267
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
over four years now and i've been in the

268
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,959
mobile application security space for

269
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,640
about six years now

270
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,040
i've been a pen tester here uh

271
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,360
application security trainer and i also

272
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,200
help write best practices for now

273
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,080
secures customers along with creating a

274
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,920
training on siberia on mobile

275
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,680
application security so if you're new to

276
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,279
mobile application security there's a

277
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,200
free training out there on cyborg called

278
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,680
mobile security 101 check it out my

279
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,560
favorite drink is sazerac um

280
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,680
i don't know i like it it's kind of

281
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,239
licoricey

282
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,600
so we're going through

283
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,480
our

284
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,800
10 best practices these are the things i

285
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
would tell you if i was like the mobile

286
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,560
security bartender and kind of telling

287
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,920
you hey these are

288
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,800
10 high-level tips to be aware of 10

289
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,399
things to kind of take away

290
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,000
and kind of build on top of and we're

291
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,680
going to kind of scale things up as we

292
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,519
go because i know not all of you are

293
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,839
beginners and a lot of you are so you

294
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,000
know i want to be able to give you all a

295
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,399
little bit of context and where to start

296
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,959
and where to go

297
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,560
and i think really

298
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,320
to get started you have to really get

299
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,920
started in the right way

300
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,760
so for those of you who are attending

301
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,080
this session you're likely aware that

302
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,839
it's really focused around masvs and

303
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,240
mstg if you're not masvs is the mobile

304
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
application security verification

305
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,480
standard say that five times fast mstg

306
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,800
is the mobile security testing guide so

307
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,519
masvs is kind of like a requirements

308
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,760
guideline a great way if you're starting

309
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,440
off in building apps or you already have

310
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,160
an app security program or just have a

311
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,920
bunch of developers who want to know hey

312
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,360
what are the things i should be aware of

313
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,600
when building apps it's just a great

314
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
guide for figuring those things out and

315
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,680
kind of setting some standards

316
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,000
and with standards you need to have test

317
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
cases and methodologies to go against

318
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,079
those standards and that's what the mstg

319
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,279
is the msdg is a cross-platform kind of

320
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,440
thing for testing apps you know you have

321
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,040
ios you have android and you even have

322
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,800
hybrid framework test cases that are

323
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,320
really useful

324
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,480
many of you are likely already aware

325
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,040
that there is a mobile security project

326
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,200
on the owasp website it's called the

327
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,360
oauth mobile security project but you

328
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,440
might also be aware of the more popular

329
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,680
project the os mobile top ten

330
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,519
it's that list of you know top ten

331
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,920
issues that you know you might confront

332
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
when you're testing apps or developing

333
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,839
them it's good to be aware of because

334
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,440
you know they're telling you what order

335
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,920
of prevalence that they've been in

336
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
and that's you know that's been around

337
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,360
for a little over five years now

338
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,279
on the flip of that you have these other

339
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,160
two projects the m a svs and the mstg

340
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,320
and on top of those two you have the

341
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,079
mobile security testing checklist which

342
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,720
really just implements masvs and mstg

343
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
and kind of to a checklist that's useful

344
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,240
if you're you know

345
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,600
building out these programs and trying

346
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,920
to pen test apps and going down the line

347
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,279
trying to fill out the checklist

348
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
so on top of getting started there's a

349
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,839
whole other aspect to what you're doing

350
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,800
for me pen testing really comes down to

351
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,399
using all your senses it sounds kind of

352
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,480
silly but hear me out

353
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,680
in mobile

354
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,360
you really need to have different types

355
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,680
of tools different types of cases where

356
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,120
you know not one tool is going to work

357
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,800
for every scenario and you want to be

358
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
able to use all your senses

359
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,839
you want to be able to use jailbroken

360
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,519
and rooted devices because those really

361
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,279
open the door to use a lot of open

362
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,760
source tools to use a lot of tools that

363
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,240
you know require the ability to do

364
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
certain actions on the device that

365
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,760
really aren't built in

366
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,519
on top of that open source tools really

367
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,360
are powerful because they are really

368
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,959
what you'll be relying on to do a lot of

369
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,360
that type of testing eventually you will

370
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
probably look to automation to figure

371
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,519
out a lot of these problems but

372
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,600
ultimately a lot of high-risk scenarios

373
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
are going to require things to be done

374
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,440
manual and manual analysis is always

375
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,760
going to be a part of security testing

376
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,839
the other part of this course is that

377
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,680
you actually have to know what apps you

378
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,639
have

379
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,560
and this might sound silly

380
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,800
but you know it's okay to not know how

381
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,760
many apps you have but as time goes on

382
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
you'll want to ask yourself oh is that

383
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,200
one of our apps or is that one of the

384
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,600
public apps that we use oh do i care

385
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,360
about the public apps that we're using

386
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,519
or hey is this developer developing an

387
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,279
app just to be used by him or is it

388
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,200
being used by her and all these other

389
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,519
people or all these other folks who are

390
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,600
a necessary part of the team and you'll

391
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
eventually want to figure out how you

392
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,639
want to approach those and we'll have

393
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,160
some solutions for that later on down

394
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,320
the line

395
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,000
the other end of mobile application

396
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,480
security testing i think that's really

397
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,720
important when starting out is learning

398
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,279
the attack surface

399
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,200
a lot of you are probably coming from

400
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,440
the web application world and you're

401
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,519
probably really well adverse with the

402
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,079
web security issues how web is

403
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,720
structured and you know maybe you're not

404
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,959
but there are really some big technical

405
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,600
hurdles you're gonna have to come over

406
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,920
when transitioning to mobile and most of

407
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
it has to go along with that the fact

408
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,000
that you're really running source code

409
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,560
on a remote device you're dealing with a

410
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,120
lot of aspects that you really can't

411
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,920
trust and a lot of the issues in web do

412
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,240
translate over to mobile but you kind of

413
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,519
have to be a different type of

414
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,959
practitioner and you kind of have to

415
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,279
take a different point of view because

416
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,839
the attack surface is really complex

417
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,880
and what's great is if you're using

418
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,279
m-a-s-v-s you're covered because

419
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,600
m-a-s-v-s really does touch on a lot of

420
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,839
these things that really

421
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,720
for a lot of security professionals is

422
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,800
the full scope of mobile

423
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
not only are we talking about the things

424
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,560
that are happening on the device the

425
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,920
things that are being sent from the

426
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,040
device

427
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,680
the platform itself but you know also

428
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,160
the design aspects any other things that

429
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,760
come into place

430
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,639
so ultimately you'll be able to kind of

431
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,440
figure out what's important what's not

432
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,240
important and in most cases you know

433
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,760
you'll be able to figure out what your

434
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,160
app's attack surface is because all apps

435
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,079
are a little bit different

436
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,920
and all apps have a little bit of a

437
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,519
different attack surface and a perfect

438
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,880
example is having a feature like in-app

439
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,240
browsers

440
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,639
or a web view

441
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,360
this brings us to the first change

442
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,120
in the mesvs spec so for those of you

443
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,959
who are very familiar with it and have

444
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,480
been following it

445
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,399
uh you may already know some of these

446
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,240
changes for those of you who haven't

447
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,680
looked at it in maybe a year this is

448
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,519
great because this is an opportunity for

449
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,040
you to find out what are some of the new

450
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,839
things in mas vs

451
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,519
and some of the new stuff around

452
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,360
platform interactions

453
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,079
are

454
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,920
better webview practices and a lot of

455
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,560
those webview issues that i see

456
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
relate to how

457
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,480
that webview content is stored on the

458
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,279
device how those webview content

459
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,519
best practices really come down to where

460
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,600
you're loading that content from how

461
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,680
you're loading it and how it ends up on

462
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,360
the device eventually

463
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,440
so being able to verify that type of

464
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,600
storage really is kind of a forensics

465
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,680
challenge a data address challenge and

466
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,360
really requires jailbroken rooted

467
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,399
devices

468
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,320
another one that was added this past

469
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
year was third third-party keyboards

470
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
whether you want to support them or not

471
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,519
sometimes third-party keyboards can be

472
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,839
extraneous because they can represent

473
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,079
another attack vector for an application

474
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,000
if you accept any keyboard

475
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,079
on top of that overlay detection is a

476
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,079
huge thing for a lot of applications

477
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,320
especially in the financial space so

478
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,240
being able to leverage the android

479
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,959
platform features that are in 10 and 11

480
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,639
are really going to be important to

481
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,120
really confronting those attacks

482
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,680
like cloak and dagger

483
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,440
number three is knowing where your data

484
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,519
is when it is it's a little convoluted

485
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,040
sounds a little weird but we'll get

486
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,120
there

487
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,800
when i'm talking about sensitive data on

488
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,680
a device i'm really talking about what's

489
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,440
being stored on the device how it's

490
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,000
being stored onto the device and who has

491
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,279
access to it

492
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,680
so there's a number of mechanisms both

493
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,600
in android and ios

494
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,920
that allow users

495
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,360
other apps

496
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,480
or even

497
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,519
other

498
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,880
places to access the data on your device

499
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,399
and it's important to be aware of what

500
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,160
those things might be

501
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,480
not only that but when we actually start

502
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
looking at the mobile top 10 you're

503
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,360
going to see

504
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,519
data at raster sensitive data issues as

505
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,400
number two

506
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,839
that's m2

507
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,319
in my opinion it might even be m1

508
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,439
because it's something i see so often

509
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,599
data storage testing is actually kind of

510
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,439
one of my favorite areas you really do

511
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,959
need a jailbroken or rooted device

512
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,079
because if you really want to see

513
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,839
everything that's stored on the device

514
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,079
you need to get that level of access

515
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,720
that level of privilege that you need to

516
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,039
really kind of compromise the device and

517
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,679
in some cases you don't so being aware

518
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,280
of how that data is stored and how it

519
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,360
could be shared is really a necessary

520
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,840
part to understanding how that data

521
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,520
might be used by somebody who's

522
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,600
malicious or somebody who steals a phone

523
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,080
or even somebody who's remote so having

524
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,559
all those controls in place are super

525
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,640
important and being able to test against

526
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,160
those cases is just as important mstg

527
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,120
has a great section called mstg storage

528
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,880
that really helps you kind of figure out

529
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,480
those test cases

530
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,760
and you know

531
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,559
works for both platforms so in terms of

532
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,880
changes in masbs

533
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,400
we're looking at just a few changes that

534
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,240
were added a lot of them are more about

535
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,160
the state in which data is on your

536
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
device when that's why i kind of said in

537
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,360
the beginning you know the best

538
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,440
practices know when your data is there

539
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,320
for how long and in this case you know

540
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,120
keeping data in memory instead of

541
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,480
storing it on the device is a good

542
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,400
practice and you know checking what's

543
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
stored in private storage or in public

544
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,280
storage on the device if you're on

545
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,440
android is a good way to verify what's

546
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,720
being stored

547
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,919
the other thing that's a really good

548
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,720
practice is if your application has a

549
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
user who fails to authenticate to it

550
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,559
multiple times it might be a good

551
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,960
practice to just wipe the sensitive data

552
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
off the device that wouldn't be to say

553
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,200
to wipe the entire device but as a

554
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,039
mobile app you have control over what's

555
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,360
stored on the private app folder or the

556
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,760
public app folder that's in scope and

557
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,240
you might choose to just wipe that data

558
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,080
after so many failed attempts especially

559
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,640
for highly sensitive apps the other

560
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,480
thing too that was added in this last

561
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,880
year was encryption for sensitive data

562
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,000
and this one kind of seems like a

563
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,240
no-brainer but it is a challenge

564
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,160
implementing encryption on mobile sounds

565
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,760
like it's a simple thing

566
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,280
and it can be the platforms have

567
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,120
actually gotten really great

568
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,720
uh back in the day they were more

569
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,400
complicated issues there were issues

570
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,080
with secure random there were issues

571
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,520
with how that

572
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
those uh cryptographic primitives could

573
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,160
be generated and be stored and you know

574
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,280
actually

575
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,480
it correctly

576
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,799
and even though that stuff is out of the

577
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,720
scope of data storage

578
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,919
when you're actually implementing

579
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,240
encryption for sensitive data those

580
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,720
things kind of become part of that whole

581
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,640
issue for data storage because you know

582
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,240
encryption just makes sensitive data

583
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,600
issues into

584
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,559
key storage issues

585
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,039
the next one is really kind of

586
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,640
controversial i think for a lot of

587
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,559
people who come from the web world

588
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,640
and you know to tell somebody

589
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,039
client-side security is important uh

590
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,400
they might scoff at you

591
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,440
and the thing with client-side security

592
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,679
is on mobile it's really important

593
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,679
because a lot of the protections and a

594
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,919
lot of the controls that need to be put

595
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,159
into place have to happen on the client

596
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,480
side and i think the perfect example

597
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
is network security because a lot of you

598
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,000
come from the you know the web world and

599
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,480
browsers typically will handle a lot of

600
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,240
the handshake issues whether you know

601
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,799
it's hosting verification or accepting

602
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,799
of self-signed certs you get that big

603
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,640
red triangle and you think oh i can't go

604
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,000
on this website i'll go to a different

605
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,360
website you know that's not the website

606
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,720
i want to be on

607
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
on mobile it is

608
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,960
not something that happens by default

609
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,559
it's actually something that needs to be

610
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,880
coded in by the developer

611
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,320
and then

612
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,240
the error handling has to actually

613
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,120
handle that correctly

614
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,240
other things that come into play and i

615
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,440
kind of touched on this was encryption

616
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,760
encryption is really important and you

617
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
know mobile really gives you a lot of

618
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,919
controls hardware-backed storage to

619
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,080
really implement encryption in a really

620
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,760
sophisticated way

621
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,000
and those controls all have to happen

622
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,080
client-side and finally build settings

623
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,320
and build settings might sound silly but

624
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,840
build settings are really important

625
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,080
because they can really prevent a lot of

626
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,799
basic attacks and build settings let you

627
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,200
kind of optimize the app

628
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
to leverage the platform controls and if

629
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,640
you really want to take advantage of all

630
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,000
the controls that are in you know ios 11

631
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,520
or oh sorry

632
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,120
android 11 and ios 14 you're going to

633
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,039
really have to use those build settings

634
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,440
and i can tell you that if you're

635
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,280
planning on publishing apps in the

636
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,240
future

637
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,919
those build settings are going to

638
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,440
increase they're going to be things that

639
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,200
you thought shouldn't have been required

640
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,559
in the previous version are going to be

641
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,799
required for next year so be aware of

642
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,480
those things some of them are like scope

643
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,720
storage some of them are like app

644
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,400
signing keys um and schema versions

645
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,240
and it's good to be aware of those

646
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,679
things and we'll talk a little bit about

647
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,159
that later

648
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,600
so a lot of people ask me well you know

649
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,960
you mentioned testing network on mobile

650
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,200
and really to me this is almost the most

651
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,640
important part

652
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,720
in mobile app testing to some degree

653
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,720
because a lot of the information you're

654
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,159
going to get during this testing is

655
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,400
going to help you out later on

656
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,159
and in mobile a lot of what you're

657
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,400
actually testing is the error handling

658
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,840
you're actually testing to see if the

659
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
validations are being performed if they

660
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,679
react correctly and they error in the

661
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,600
right way you expect them to because if

662
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,200
you're being man in the middle you

663
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,440
really hope that the application will

664
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,559
make the user aware or will respond in

665
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,320
the way that it doesn't fail up and it

666
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,000
only fails down

667
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,159
in terms of proxies you should use it's

668
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,919
really up to you there's a lot of great

669
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,280
ones out there and i'm not going to say

670
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,640
any of their names

671
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,520
but with that in mind mstg has a really

672
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,400
great methodology page on how to do this

673
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,000
kind of taking on there's different

674
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,760
types of man-in-the-middle attacks that

675
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
are of different severities and then

676
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,000
even after that if your app is perfect

677
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
and does something like certificate

678
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,280
pinning you're still going to want to

679
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,720
bypass those controls because you're

680
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,799
going to want to see what's actually in

681
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,320
the tls tunnel

682
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,240
and again following those mas vs

683
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,480
requirements make sure that https is

684
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,640
implemented on all requests but not only

685
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,200
that that it's implemented correctly and

686
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,720
for certificate pinning if you think

687
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,799
your app may need that

688
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,320
you should work with developers and

689
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,559
figure out if the case is helpful for

690
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,919
your application because it is a

691
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,679
challenge to implement and you should be

692
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,240
aware of that

693
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,400
so many of you probably thought network

694
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,919
testing you thought well are you talking

695
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,000
about session management authentication

696
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,919
what are you getting at and in this next

697
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,320
bullet point really uh for mobile you

698
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,039
know

699
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,600
bad web off is bad mobile off is really

700
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,279
speaking to the fact that the issues in

701
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,720
one are pretty much the same as the

702
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,320
other

703
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,240
one thing i've noticed a lot of in

704
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,600
mobile testing

705
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,640
is

706
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
that a lot of the issues

707
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,080
on web

708
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,840
are common in mobile

709
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,640
and

710
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,240
it's been my opinion that a lot of

711
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,760
mobile authentication tends to get

712
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,919
watered down or gets to be implemented

713
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,320
in a way that you know worked for web it

714
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,159
didn't work for mobile or it doesn't

715
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,240
really work for mobile because the logic

716
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,919
isn't there there's new controls in

717
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,520
place there's other things that can be

718
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,039
done in mobile that kind of make mobile

719
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,720
a little more complex

720
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,880
but with that said a lot of the really

721
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,559
common issues in the web are still in

722
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,960
mobile so you know rate limiting issues

723
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,520
authorization issues logic flaws uh you

724
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,120
know lack of timeouts those are all

725
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,039
really common things to see in mobile

726
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,400
applications

727
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,640
and in terms of complexity i mentioned

728
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,960
network testing and in network testing

729
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,880
you know a lot of it is seeing if those

730
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,799
controls are in place but when you're

731
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,480
talking about looking at the

732
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,159
authentication and session management in

733
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,600
a mobile application especially if

734
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,400
you're doing great box black box testing

735
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,960
you have to bypass those controls if you

736
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,559
know network security is being done

737
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,640
correctly so not only do you have to

738
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,400
bypass them then you have to make sure

739
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,880
that you know does biometric how does

740
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,520
biometric behave differently to log in

741
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,600
than you know the normal flow

742
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,000
is there local off in an application

743
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,679
multi-factor is another thing how is

744
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,360
multi-factor implemented and how is it

745
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,600
performed and is the logic the same as

746
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
what you would see on the website and

747
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,200
more often than not you know it's hard

748
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,240
to say it's it's a mixed bag so when we

749
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,960
start looking at the changes in mesvs

750
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,039
we really see that the authorization

751
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,679
models that are expected you know you

752
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,679
can have stateful you can have stateless

753
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,200
session management

754
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,120
but the most important thing to really

755
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,360
keep in mind is that everything has to

756
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,840
be handled server-side so i know you're

757
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,279
probably laughing didn't you just say

758
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,279
like client-side security matters yes

759
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,880
but server-side security matters still

760
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,039
too both of them matter uh server-side

761
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,960
security's super important for this

762
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,480
authentication and session management

763
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,440
stuff and you know it actually has a

764
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,559
couple of

765
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,360
uh line items in the standard for you

766
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,600
know making sure that you know stuff is

767
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,919
remotely enforced so making sure that

768
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,400
that stuff is remotely enforced is super

769
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,960
necessary

770
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,559
another area of interest for a lot of

771
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,000
people is you know the reverse

772
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,840
engineering resilience that people can

773
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,880
build into applications

774
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,320
and the one thing i'll tell you is that

775
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,960
a lot of these controls are great

776
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,360
but they don't compensate

777
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,960
for the security controls you have in

778
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,600
your app so reverse engineering controls

779
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,440
uh are kind of broad you know there's

780
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,360
some that prevent you from tampering the

781
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,440
app there's some that are built that if

782
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,120
somebody does try to reverse engineer

783
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,679
the app uh it's difficult to interpret

784
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,320
the logic uh there's some that are built

785
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,480
specifically for device binding so you

786
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
know if you want to use your device as a

787
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,120
token as you know one of the you know

788
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,559
mfa

789
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,240
requirements you know reverse

790
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,600
engineering resilience can help with

791
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,919
that if you're an application that you

792
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,360
know really

793
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
finds it necessary to not only protect

794
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,679
the information in the tls tunnel but

795
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,159
your user's privacy payload encryption

796
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,919
makes sense you know maybe you don't

797
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,000
want to know what's

798
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,240
being sent from and by your users so you

799
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,600
know payload encryption might be

800
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,960
something that solves that for a lot of

801
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,840
messaging apps where privacy is a

802
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,880
concern and

803
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,919
those are all really important controls

804
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,679
but

805
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,919
they have to be brought in after the

806
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,640
security controls have been verified so

807
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,880
you know it's tempting to say oh i'll

808
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,480
just put root detection and that'll fix

809
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,240
all these issues or i'll use this or

810
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,480
i'll use mdm or i'll do this

811
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,279
and

812
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,279
you know those are controls that are

813
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,880
great

814
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,399
but they're not going to fix

815
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,159
vulnerabilities those vulnerabilities

816
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,480
are still going to be there and if

817
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,320
you're going to be testing mobile apps

818
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,919
with developers you're going to want to

819
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,279
make sure that you're testing the

820
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,159
security controls before you're testing

821
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,279
those reverse engineering resiliences

822
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,640
with that said

823
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,880
you absolutely 100

824
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,200
have to test those reverse engineering

825
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,480
controls

826
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,720
they take a lot of experience a lot of

827
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,600
skill takes a lot of know how to do that

828
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,360
and it's challenging because what you're

829
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,240
really trying to do is bypass things

830
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,080
that have been built for you to not

831
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,559
bypass them they're built to you know

832
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,640
stop your tools your open source tools

833
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,720
or other things that people are building

834
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,360
to do exactly what you know you really

835
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,679
need to do to understand the app

836
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,720
so

837
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,360
that does take a lot of work and to some

838
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,200
degree it is a cat and mouse game these

839
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,279
tools are being outdated updated changed

840
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,039
all the time and it's kind of like left

841
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,039
right left right going after each other

842
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,960
all the time so

843
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,840
being able to you know be aware of that

844
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,279
you know making sure that your security

845
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,640
control is in place

846
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,159
then testing those resiliencies and

847
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,279
making sure that they're working and

848
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,039
they're not simple is really important

849
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,559
so the next thing i'd recommend

850
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,039
when you're starting out and trying to

851
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,679
understand what you should be doing

852
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,520
really is the thing that you should be

853
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,200
doing even after you learn all this

854
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,840
stuff and it's kind of a never-ending

855
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,480
goal is policy policy is

856
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,679
you know the it is the horizon

857
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,480
on the mountain it is the goal

858
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,120
and you know kind of the final the final

859
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,640
step to some degree but it's also kind

860
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,640
of a first step as well because your

861
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,240
applications need baselines they need

862
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,559
requirements they need standards and

863
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,039
masbs actually has a really good you

864
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,880
know model for this they call the appsec

865
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,480
model and the apsec model breaks things

866
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,880
up into four tiers so we went through a

867
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,240
bunch of those domains we talked a

868
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,559
little bit about their requirements

869
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,799
what's great is that every requirement i

870
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,559
mentioned not all of them are standard

871
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,000
some of them are defense and depth for

872
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,440
instance certificate pinning the defense

873
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,919
and depth requirement uh and not only

874
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,679
that those resilience requirements don't

875
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,320
always fit into every single application

876
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,120
so what the masbs standard did was it

877
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,559
kind of broke things up into two

878
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,080
categories i like to think of it as kind

879
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,159
of a pun and square uh for those of you

880
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,240
who took you know junior high high

881
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,720
school biology and you remember mendel

882
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,559
and the ps and you know how those ps

883
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,080
worked and you know you try to figure

884
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,760
out the alleles that's basically what

885
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,919
the apsec model is you have applications

886
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,080
that have standard security and defense

887
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,600
and depth security and then you have

888
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,039
applications that have a reverse

889
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,200
engineering resilience requirement so

890
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
your standard security app has to meet

891
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
baselines your defense and depth app has

892
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
to have a bunch of technology built in

893
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,840
that really protects regulated data or

894
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,520
you might be an app that really doesn't

895
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,720
do a lot of complex regulatory things

896
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,520
but has a lot of sensitive ip

897
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,799
and of course you could have apps that

898
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,880
do both of those things so building on

899
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,360
that is a really great start to figuring

900
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,880
out what you should be doing and what

901
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,120
you should be prioritizing in terms of

902
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
fixing because it's a challenge you know

903
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,880
everybody wants to know how do i look

904
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,039
compared to my competitors apps how do i

905
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,960
look compared to these other industries

906
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,240
and this is a great start to kind of

907
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,640
figure that out

908
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,799
the other thing on top of that in terms

909
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,000
of policy policies

910
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,919
not to forget that you can't skip

911
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,720
privacy anymore

912
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,440
and to kind of build on to that you know

913
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,840
privacy is now regulatory you know

914
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,760
privacy isn't what it used to be now

915
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,000
it's something that's required and you

916
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
know there's different states that are

917
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,600
adding their own privacy frameworks

918
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,519
different countries i won't go into

919
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,919
details most of you know these things or

920
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,080
if you're not you know you can you know

921
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,640
google one of those four letter acronyms

922
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,279
uh in my opinion the best approach to

923
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,799
privacy is kind of just being aware of

924
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,600
what application data your app consumes

925
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,519
kind of taking this approach that you

926
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,600
have a white list or you have a list of

927
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,919
you know pieces of data that you're

928
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,440
expecting your app to consume consumer

929
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,760
app to use because when you have that

930
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,840
data you've become the custodian of that

931
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,799
data you have responsibility over it and

932
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,919
that comes with a lot of responsibility

933
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,840
so teaching concepts like you know

934
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,039
principle of least privilege to

935
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,880
developers really helps them understand

936
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
you know don't take everything because

937
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,519
it is kind of a like a common thing i've

938
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,240
seen developers do that they'll collect

939
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,440
more information than maybe they

940
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,240
necessarily need and they'll think oh if

941
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,000
i need that later on i'll you know i'll

942
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,840
have that so i can use that for some

943
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
reason or another and you know maybe

944
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,600
that's unnecessary

945
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,480
the other thing too is third-party sdks

946
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,720
really might be the bigger concern

947
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,240
because third-party sdks kind of

948
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,559
represent this other thing where you may

949
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,080
not know what it's doing or it may be

950
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,000
doing things and collecting things that

951
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,159
you're not aware of and i like to kind

952
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,840
of say it's the monster under the bed

953
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,039
because you're not always sure what it's

954
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,799
going to do unless you test the app and

955
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,279
actually see what it's doing so be aware

956
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,120
of that it may not be your developer's

957
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,679
fault it may be the third party sdk or

958
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,760
library that they're relying on that's

959
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
important for business continuity that

960
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,840
might be the problem

961
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,880
so building on to that idea of policy

962
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,279
and privacy i think it's important to

963
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,200
consider that you know all apps are

964
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,600
different

965
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,320
there's all these different things that

966
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,640
come into play and there's really not an

967
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,720
easy way to say there's only four

968
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,480
requirements or there's only

969
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,399
four logical cases where you'd want to

970
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,799
do this because all apps have different

971
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,880
business logic they all have different

972
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,360
uses you know they all have

973
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,440
change and i'm not even talking about

974
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,240
just

975
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,679
different apps i'm talking about the

976
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,159
same app even an app changes it gets new

977
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,720
features new infrastructure you know new

978
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,360
regulations new you know new technology

979
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,320
and everything changes not only that

980
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,840
but i'm sure a bunch of you are thinking

981
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,919
well you know maybe i'll just use a

982
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,679
cross-platform framework and that will

983
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,840
just simplify everything

984
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,919
and this might be startling to some of

985
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,240
you but cross-platform frameworks don't

986
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,039
simplify security you still have

987
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,519
two apps you still have an ios app and

988
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,519
an android app and they both have to be

989
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,360
tested independently because they have

990
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,720
different platforms they have different

991
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
requirements and have different issues

992
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,159
and you know don't let anybody lie to

993
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,360
you because they are

994
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,159
two

995
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,919
different things

996
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,039
ultimately

997
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,720
you're going to want to make sure that

998
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,640
whatever you're doing in terms of you

999
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,760
know developing you know this priority

1000
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,320
and prescribing context to these issues

1001
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,559
all have to be done from behind a threat

1002
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,600
model so as your organization matures

1003
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,919
look into that figure out what matters

1004
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,839
in your app figure out what the business

1005
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,679
requirements are in your app because

1006
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,760
that's really going to guide how you

1007
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
prioritize these things and how you

1008
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,520
choose where you fall in that quadrant

1009
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,679
and how you then build on that quadrant

1010
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,199
in terms of things you think you also

1011
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,960
need to do or things you may think

1012
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,040
aren't really in context for what you

1013
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,520
need to do

1014
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,040
and number 10

1015
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,760
probably the most unpopular opinion of

1016
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,839
all you need to partner with developers

1017
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,199
starting off

1018
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,639
developers you know are relying on a lot

1019
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,560
of the same sources you are and those

1020
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,440
sources aren't always useful you know

1021
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,280
a lot of code is out there a lot of it's

1022
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,040
being copy pasted into applications and

1023
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,719
it's not all secure

1024
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,599
a uh a friend of mine from a you know

1025
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,200
reputable university shared the

1026
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,880
statistic with me

1027
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,640
and when i saw it you know it really

1028
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,119
blew my mind because i thought to myself

1029
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,800
man i look at stack overflow all the

1030
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,760
time

1031
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,960
and

1032
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,760
that's frightening

1033
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,800
so my tip to you

1034
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,119
is to go out of your way

1035
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,480
to kind of

1036
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,920
build a relationship with these

1037
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,359
developers

1038
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,240
the fact is is that security is about

1039
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,560
you know really providing requirements

1040
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,320
you're not building these things

1041
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
developers are building them

1042
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,400
you have to work with them you have to

1043
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,800
figure out what the mistakes are because

1044
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,599
the tools you're using might you know

1045
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,720
flag something as a false negative

1046
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,560
or you know maybe a false positive and

1047
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,200
mistakes happen and you know really a

1048
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,720
lot of good security code is air

1049
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,960
handling and that kind of is a hard

1050
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,880
thing to handle so you have to work with

1051
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,760
them

1052
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,599
the other thing is

1053
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,800
like i said your policy is going to

1054
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,119
change guess what a big part of that

1055
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,920
policy changing is

1056
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,000
the updates to the os

1057
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,440
and you know who's going to know a lot

1058
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,160
about the new features in the os the new

1059
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,079
requirements in the os

1060
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,240
developers so you really have to work

1061
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,320
with them to learn about these things

1062
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
figure out what's going to prevent them

1063
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
from uploading an app to the app store

1064
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,680
because that might be a security

1065
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,200
requirement that might be easy for you

1066
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,960
to enable it might just be a flag that

1067
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,359
you just have to set to true or false

1068
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,040
and not only that being aware of those

1069
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
things really helps you understand oh

1070
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,280
hey this new feature actually helps us

1071
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,920
out with you know issue a b and c

1072
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,440
and you know that kind of helps

1073
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,280
remediate some of those things so being

1074
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,640
aware of those things and working with

1075
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,480
developers and kind of developing those

1076
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,000
standards with them

1077
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,599
you know understanding their business

1078
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,960
logic cases

1079
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,119
does help build a better organization

1080
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,240
so that's my top ten

1081
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,400
and one thing i'll tell you is that

1082
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,800
that top 10 isn't in any particular

1083
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,920
order

1084
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,160
really i think there are things here

1085
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,000
that are more important when starting

1086
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,680
out you know figuring out your policy

1087
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,040
and getting on the right path and

1088
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,720
working with developers

1089
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,160
are really crucial things if you're

1090
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,599
building a program

1091
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,079
and understanding all these things in

1092
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,920
terms of you know how they work and how

1093
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,160
that attack surface should be handled is

1094
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,320
important as well and i wouldn't say any

1095
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,680
of these things is more important than

1096
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,240
one another it's just being aware of how

1097
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,079
they really matter in terms of your

1098
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,359
program

1099
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,280
so if you're starting out i hope you use

1100
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,960
this to kind of figure out where to go

1101
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,240
next

1102
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,200
again i'm tony i hope this was helpful

1103
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,040
and i'm going to hand this back off to

1104
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,680
brian thank you

1105
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,520
all right tony that was really awesome

1106
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,119
so i'd like to to bring together some

1107
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,200
summary recommendations as we enjoy a

1108
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,920
nice cold drinking beverage right now so

1109
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,359
it's clear that mobile and web are

1110
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,280
different and that there's a fantastic

1111
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,040
set of tools and infrastructure around

1112
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,880
the oauth mobile program and a lot of

1113
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,320
really great people that are out there

1114
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,839
to help you not only grow your skill

1115
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,079
sets but also pick and choose tools and

1116
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,520
and leverage them as you grow your

1117
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,440
skills for yourself and for your

1118
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,880
organization to really build out a

1119
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,359
strong mobile app sec program take the

1120
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,280
time to learn the dedication pays off

1121
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,440
right there is a huge shortage in mobile

1122
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,599
security analysts with real skills this

1123
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,920
is a great way to augment your skill set

1124
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,680
and help your company as well and work

1125
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,119
your way up the career ladder if that's

1126
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,800
where you want to go if you're really

1127
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,480
interested in exploring complex

1128
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,560
interesting things this is a great

1129
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,320
technology stack to look at around

1130
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,760
mobile especially when you get things

1131
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,640
like iot connected devices

1132
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,720
so tools so very briefly a couple of

1133
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,640
tool examples so there's a lot of open

1134
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,720
source or cheap easy to use tools out

1135
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,480
there frida and radari we talked about

1136
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,400
our researchers have produced for you a

1137
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,240
lot of use of burp and minim proxy for

1138
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,520
things over the network we actually

1139
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,079
embed minimum proxy in our tools lots of

1140
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,839
other tools out there some are ios

1141
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,000
specific some are android specific

1142
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,760
there's a nice repo that another

1143
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,440
security researcher posted of a whole

1144
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,200
lot of android tools they're not all

1145
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,640
still in the market but the repo is kind

1146
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,560
of a good listing that you might want to

1147
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,000
go to as well

1148
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,359
now when you think about choosing

1149
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,800
commercial tools you really need to

1150
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
think about not just can i reverse the

1151
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,560
app but what kind of tools do i have

1152
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,000
that really give me security test

1153
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,880
coverage

1154
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,520
and so best in class today really really

1155
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,359
has organization using four kinds of

1156
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,280
testing so it's a combination of static

1157
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,760
tests dynamic tests interactive tests

1158
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,240
and api testing for those back ends

1159
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,839
and so there's tooling out there that

1160
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,000
does some of these things there's a one

1161
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,240
vendor that does all of these things so

1162
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,520
you could put together a couple

1163
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,880
different tools to get all your test

1164
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,280
coverage or you can use a single vendor

1165
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,040
and so in terms of coverage right you

1166
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,160
want to make sure you're covering the

1167
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,760
code you need to make sure you cover

1168
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,000
that data in motion challenge set you

1169
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,760
need to make sure you cover data at rest

1170
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,119
and cover the back end and the nice

1171
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,880
thing is that static dynamic interactive

1172
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,440
and api kind of line up on this so use

1173
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,119
these as you organize your testing

1174
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,200
checklist but also use these to select

1175
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,880
the tools that you might want to use in

1176
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,640
your organization

1177
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,880
now most organizations really need to

1178
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,359
get to some level of speed repeatability

1179
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,560
and velocity

1180
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
and so what we find is whether you call

1181
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,400
it shift left or simply tooling

1182
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,960
integration into your tool chain there

1183
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,560
are good ways to build security into

1184
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,800
your sdlc so make sure you have the

1185
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,480
right policies in place make sure you

1186
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
have people trained on the tools

1187
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,319
use you know secure coding best

1188
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,920
practices right if you're in the

1189
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,000
security side of the house make sure you

1190
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,440
work with the development team to have

1191
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,280
good secure coding best practices in the

1192
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,760
first place and take advantage of that

1193
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,440
make sure you're scanning the repo so

1194
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,240
there's sca and sas tools that can scan

1195
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,079
your repos for custom and third-party

1196
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,280
code

1197
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,960
when it comes to testing mobile it's

1198
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,119
actually better to test the binary than

1199
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,200
the source code most of the web world is

1200
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,880
about testing source and there's lots of

1201
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,000
reasons for that and there's only a

1202
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,079
couple languages when you get to mobile

1203
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,119
there's lots of languages and

1204
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,319
development environments but more

1205
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,920
importantly because it's an executable

1206
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,000
running in the wild you have to test the

1207
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,760
whole thing if you test source you don't

1208
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,040
get enough so you want to test the

1209
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
binary and that's why state of the art

1210
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,440
today is automated binary testing from

1211
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,960
companies like now secure and a few

1212
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,160
others out there

1213
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,319
now if you have many different mobile

1214
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,000
apps make sure you take advantage of

1215
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
threat modeling that tony talked about

1216
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,000
and do your tiered risk strategy and so

1217
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,760
those higher risk apps don't rely on

1218
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,200
automated tools make sure you're

1219
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,520
wrapping some pen testing in there along

1220
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,800
with your automated tools right so the

1221
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,640
automated tools are like a smoke test

1222
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,319
much like you've automated functional

1223
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,920
testing tools you can use automated

1224
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,839
security testing tools then for your

1225
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,520
higher risk applications you still got

1226
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,040
to run that pen test and everything we

1227
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,200
just taught you you can apply to do that

1228
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
pen test yourself

1229
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,960
and then finally kind of monitor in

1230
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,800
production make sure you understand how

1231
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,240
the app is behaving in production make

1232
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,079
sure you're handling bug fix releases

1233
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,760
and change requests because obviously

1234
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,000
those are places where you can inject

1235
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,680
basically new vulnerabilities that you

1236
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,160
hadn't seen before the great thing now

1237
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,079
today is that automated tools and

1238
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,800
integration capabilities are

1239
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,400
light years from where they were five

1240
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,079
years ago or even three years ago so

1241
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,920
take advantage of those as well and

1242
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,280
there's a great mix for you in

1243
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,240
automation as well as expert pen testing

1244
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,720
tony shared the details on the masvs and

1245
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,200
mstg resources i have a couple more for

1246
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,000
you

1247
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,680
tony's bashful but i want to share he's

1248
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,319
got some great cyber classes so good

1249
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,920
starter class here on mobile app

1250
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,599
security for you

1251
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,119
we've got a guide to really

1252
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,119
understanding the entire owasp mobile

1253
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,680
security project you can click on that

1254
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,280
if you're working hard with developers

1255
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,400
you want to understand secure

1256
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,880
development coding practices right the

1257
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,680
mstg and masbs are focused really on

1258
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
security analysis and testing if you

1259
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,040
want to have know how to write secure

1260
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,280
code we have some stuff on that and then

1261
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,720
i had some stats at the beginning when

1262
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,160
we made some infographics and other

1263
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,760
reference docs on the most frequently

1264
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,280
found vulnerabilities and what that

1265
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,839
basically means is use our learning on

1266
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,440
where to look for the likely

1267
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,880
vulnerabilities and where you need to

1268
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,960
train your developers to write secure

1269
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,000
code as well from our top five

1270
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,599
we're also having a little fun ourselves

1271
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,319
so we actually have a m-a-s-v-s drink

1272
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,800
list so our company kind of enjoys their

1273
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,480
share we're not a bunch of drunks but we

1274
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,880
like to have a good time uh so the crew

1275
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,720
has pitched in and we've got our top 10

1276
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,480
drinks list you can get that from the

1277
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,319
link here some of them you'll recognize

1278
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:01,599
some of them are a little strange we

1279
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:02,960
hope you enjoy them should you like to

1280
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,920
mix your own cocktail at home

1281
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,680
and with that on behalf of tony and

1282
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,359
myself i'd like to thank you for joining

1283
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,599
us today you can reach out to now secure

1284
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,440
for more information on any of these

1285
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,760
tony and i have provided our emails here

1286

mobile program the mas vs and the mistg

1297
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,319
it's been a huge project over the years

1298
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,640
and there's many new things to come so
