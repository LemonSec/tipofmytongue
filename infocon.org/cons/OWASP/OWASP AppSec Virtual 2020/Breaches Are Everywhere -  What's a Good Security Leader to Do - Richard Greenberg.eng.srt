hopefully when this

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,199
covet 19 issue

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,680
ends we'll be able to resume with that

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,359
it's a great

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,319
system

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,360
so

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,439
let's get started with some details

33
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,880
there's a heightened awareness of

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,840
security and we all know what covert 19

35
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,960
has been doing

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,360
and uh you know boardrooms now have

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,680
security on their agendas 80 of the time

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,560
which is

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,159
definitely an improvement

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,600
uh they're a weekly news item

41
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,320
unfortunately on mainstream media

42
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,280
um and we all know and had our friends

43
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,680
and cousins and everyone asking us for

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,600
advice about security because now that

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,240
it's mainstream we are now in mainstream

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,479
in our positions which wasn't always the

47
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,280
case

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
even the government which is way behind

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,399
usually with technology and advancements

50
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,000
is looking to create security and

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,159
privacy regulations although i would not

52
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,600
expect you

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,960
to use that

54
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,280
as anything for your security program

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,479
other than

56
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,960
to get visibility within your company

57
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,719
and to possibly get funding so don't

58
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,240
look for the government

59
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,079
to help you with your program other than

60
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,079
to help you with funding because what

61
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,000
they put in regulations

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
is the bare minimum then i would not

63
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,119
recommend that

64
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,720
so our data is leaking unfortunately we

65
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
know this all too much

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,959
and breaches are occurring everywhere

67
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,239
every company

68
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,319
phishing attacks are multiplying and now

69
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,840
the preferred method of infiltration

70
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,680
and it's

71
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,720
279 days

72
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,680
before the average company can even

73
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,720
become aware of a breach and contain it

74
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,680
and

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,800
quite often

76
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,360
they find out from the fbi or some other

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,599
external source because their monitoring

78
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,440
systems aren't in place

79
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,000
with enough capacity to understand and

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
identify this

81
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,599
what's the life cycle of a malicious

82
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,879
attack from breach to containment

83
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,480
314 days and attackers are now silent

84
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,239
the old days of

85
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,280
doing

86
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,879
uh

87
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,879
issues to the website

88
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,720
you know you might get a little bit of

89
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,200
that if there's an anonymous is involved

90
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,680
but most often the hackers just want to

91
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,760
get the data and not even let you know

92
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,200
that they were there

93
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,920
so the the landscape has changed quite a

94
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,560
bit and the times are changing and the

95
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
question is are you

96
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,040
because every business is now a target

97
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,680
of the medical advices and iot devices

98
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,440
on your network your car your

99
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,239
refrigerator yes we know that that smart

100
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,360
tvs and boardrooms have become targets

101
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,799
uh what about your business

102
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,640
transformation strategy do you have one

103
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,159
of these to carry on and deal with this

104
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,440
um

105
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,480
important questions so what the heck is

106
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,720
going on because all vulnerabilities are

107
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,319
still everywhere

108
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,280
remember sql injection that's 13 years

109
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
ago and guess what it's still happening

110
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,040
regularly it's still in the top oh was

111
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,000
top 10. that should not be happening

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
right ddos attacks that rely on the

113
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
vulnerability in the universal

114
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,760
plug-and-play protocol were known since

115
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,959
2001. those are still happening i can go

116
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,400
on and on with that that's just a couple

117
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,280
of examples patching is problematic i've

118
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,480
had interviews with fellow csos where

119
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,000
they say well we just can't patch

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,280
everything there's just too much it's

121
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,079
too we or we're an enterprise we're huge

122
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
i'm like well you know you have to

123
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,478
figure out a way to make that happen

124
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,960
change management it's very haphazard in

125
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,680
companies right that's got to change

126
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,479
configuration management what protocols

127
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,080
you have on and running

128
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,240
do you need them all are you securing

129
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,479
your systems how about your printers and

130
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,880
copiers nice back doors to let the

131
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,160
hackers in

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,960
and what about encryption right are you

133
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,560
encrypting your mission critical

134
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,160
information

135
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,280
so let's talk about data breach costs

136
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,919
so you know the extensive use of iot

137
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,240
devices that's that's increased by about

138
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,720
five dollars per record the cost for a

139
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,600
breach

140
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,280
and these statistics are all from the

141
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,120
ponemon institute research study from

142
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,520
last year a mega breach of a million

143
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,759
records which is not a lot in a lot of

144
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,240
systems today that will cost an average

145
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,639
of 40 million dollars

146
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,720
a mega breach of 50 million records and

147
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,080
we've seen a lot of those the last

148
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,479
couple of years will cost an average of

149
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,960
350 million dollars and then again

150
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
there's third-party breaches which are

151
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,440
really the things that you've got to be

152
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,039
extra concerned about since you don't

153
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,960
have direct control over those but

154
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,680
they'll cost an extra 370k

155
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,919
so these are things to be important and

156
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,280
how about

157
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,680
the global average of just the data

158
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,320
breach in general it's 3.9 million

159
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,039
uh so these are big numbers

160
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,120
and we see that the breaches are

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
increasing as is the sophistication in

162
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,400
the old days they would just go in there

163
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
and do some basic stuff and everybody

164
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,759
would fall for it

165
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,000
security programs are getting better but

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,759
the attackers are getting smarter too

167
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,440
they're still automating

168
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,039
right but essentially

169
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,120
all organizations are targets for

170
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,639
criminal hackers

171
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,400
so what can we do

172
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,199
what is a good security leader to do

173
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,479
well go on tour take your show on the

174
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,680
road

175
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,520
speak at division meetings speak at

176
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,759
general staff meetings make security a

177
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,720
standing agenda item at every big

178
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,919
meeting with executives at your company

179
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,400
of course security awareness is key

180
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,240
address your company's vulnerability

181
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,280
trends

182
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,000
gamify your training don't do what i'm

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,800
doing don't just do a powerpoint

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,639
make it entertaining for the people

185
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,520
where you work have contests how about

186
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
the primo parking spot for the people

187
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,440
that have come up with the best security

188
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,199
ideas right how about a cash or a

189
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,600
amazon gift card or something along

190
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,919
those lines how about pitting different

191
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,080
divisions against each other in a

192
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,160
contest to see which one can identify

193
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,080
the most vulnerabilities in the game or

194
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,960
something

195
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,039
right these are things to consider

196
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,680
right that you need to think about

197
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,000
because just another powerpoint you're

198
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,759
going to have people dazing off closing

199
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,000
their eyes just clicking through

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,039
and

201
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,199
phishing simulations are becoming more

202
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,240
the norm

203
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,160
but please

204
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,000
don't exclude your executives i know

205
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,280
they tell you that they need to be

206
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,120
excluded but they are

207
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,599
one of the most vulnerable pieces in any

208
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,880
company's hacker strategy so please be

209
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,560
careful with that

210
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,080
and how about your own team make sure

211
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,560
they're trained don't exclude system

212
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,160
admins and security professionals and

213
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,960
developers key people

214
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,039
i've got to have effective security

215
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,440
patch management i mentioned it earlier

216
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,160
but

217
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,080
you know you've got to have processes in

218
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,280
place to ensure regular time timely and

219
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,440
enterprise-wide patching

220
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
first you do your patching on a

221
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
pilot group make sure that there's no

222
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,440
issues not every patch is coming clean

223
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,879
from our vendors

224
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,360
don't forget your third-party apps

225
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,960
minimize excluding systems i'm sure that

226
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,639
you've had interactions with system

227
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,560
admins who say no i can't patch this

228
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,599
system

229
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,160
it's just it's too mission critical or

230
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
there's there's something about it

231
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
that's so proprietary that they're

232
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,720
worried about bringing it down minimize

233
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,680
those do tests you will have to exclude

234
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,720
some

235
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,000
however you can isolate those systems

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,639
you could put them in a separate vlan

237
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,560
have certain firewall rules to address

238
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,840
that

239
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,400
so don't just accept it and exclude them

240
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
and think you're going to be fine

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,840
because there's your back door

242
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,599
all right meet with the key players in

243
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,679
your companies and organizations

244
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,200
try to get some lunches with the key

245
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,479
executives

246
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,120
right if you're a cso

247
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,880
or the head of security

248
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,600
quite often you're buried

249
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,920
somewhere down the hieracle chain maybe

250
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,640
you're reporting to a cio or cto

251
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,760
right so how are you getting those

252
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,080
regular meetings with executives it's

253
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,040
worth it to spring for lunch with these

254
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,360
executives there's nothing like personal

255
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,480
interaction and in addition

256
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,880
people have these subliminal things

257
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
going on in their brain you take an

258
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,320
executive to lunch they will remember

259
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,560
that and when the decision comes hey

260
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,480
should we hear from this person or not

261
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,000
they might be more inclined than not to

262
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,080
go let's see what they have to say

263
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
because you were nice to them you

264
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,959
chatted with them

265
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,800
so keep that as a key strategy

266
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
right a lot of these things that you'll

267
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,240
be seeing in my presentation are people

268
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,360
skills

269
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,880
right we all know about a lot of the

270
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
technical skills and and technical

271
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,920
solutions that's going to be in here

272
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,040
today

273
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,959
but the people skills are really would

274
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,279
differentiate the successful security

275
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,279
professional from the ones that have

276
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,800
good intentions

277
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,480
all right you've got to meet regularly

278
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
with other people who you might not

279
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,959
consider

280
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,480
as as the people you would normally

281
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,600
think of

282
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
right we all think about ctos and

283
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
division leads but make sure your legal

284
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,440
and risk compliance are on your

285
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,519
blackboard because

286
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,360
the chief function for the head of

287
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,120
security is risk

288
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,360
it's not technical it's risk

289
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
right and please

290
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,839
learn to talk businesses i wouldn't look

291
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,000
it up in miriam webster's but that's my

292
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,519
term for what we have to do we've got to

293
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,079
talk the language of the decision makers

294
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,160
so establish and test the change

295
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,680
management process

296
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
form the change management board make

297
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,880
sure it meets regularly

298
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,720
really important stuff

299
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,600
now

300
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
policies

301
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,120
um

302
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,200
be careful all right do not include your

303
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,360
procedures in your policies and the

304
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,399
reason for that

305
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,240
the policy should be in one pager it

306
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
says what you're going to do it's the

307
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,320
procedures that tell you how you're

308
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,600
going to do that

309
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,320
and one of the key points here is

310
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,480
to get a policy change in a company

311
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,720
typically can be a big deal i can

312
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,560
involve human resources it can involve

313
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,279
the unions if you're in a union uh

314
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,240
company

315
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,480
and those can take a while to make a

316
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,120
change where procedures change regularly

317
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
so make sure about that

318
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,440
review the policies regularly and

319
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,120
anytime a significant infrastructure

320
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,760
change occurs

321
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
always engage human resources

322
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,519
you have to have your entire staff sign

323
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,399
an acceptable use policy every year and

324
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,560
this is for legal reasons so they you

325
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,720
can claim that they were aware of what

326
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
your policies were in case there is

327
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,680
anyone who goes against the policy

328
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,760
have a plan and procedures for securing

329
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,320
portable devices and byod don't punt on

330
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,880
byod it's too important has too many

331
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,079
implications

332
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,760
every user wants to just use their own

333
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,959
device

334
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,959
but there's legal

335
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,600
discovery issues if they do so make sure

336
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,279
they're aware of it

337
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,360
and make sure you've researched

338
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,640
good mdm solutions moving forward

339
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,360
bake security into the sdlc we want it

340
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,279
to actually be ssdlc we want it secure

341
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,720
right

342
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,399
let's talk about relationships

343
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,880
application development and infosec

344
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,519
they need to be joined together the

345
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,120
heads of both of these organizations

346
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,639
have to if they're not friends at least

347
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,399
have a good relationship

348
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,480
uh they've got to connect

349
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,000
infosec's got to be there from the

350
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,839
beginning of every project they've got

351
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,440
to be on the assessment team that looks

352
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,880
at projects

353
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,720
uh not just executives not just the

354
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,200
admins uh but infosec has got to be

355
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,079
there

356
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,079
um a little more technical stuff when

357
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,360
you're building your your sdlc make sure

358
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,680
you're scanning for

359
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,279
web or potential

360
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,720
vulnerabilities

361
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,600
and

362
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,880
a static can be done incorporated into

363
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,600
the decoding process and the dynamic is

364
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,680
done typically by the information

365
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,880
security team on the compile code right

366
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,480
before it goes live

367
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
uh there's also

368
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,839
lots of open source solutions that you

369
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,760
can look to uh because some of these

370
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,880
solutions can get quite pricey

371
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,639
but there's also runtime application

372
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,360
self-protection as an option as well

373
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,040
look into that

374
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,120
the ultimate goal is to automate as much

375
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,639
as we can

376
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,560
particularly with devops they're going

377
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,240
to be running that train down the

378
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,320
express track and if you're on the local

379
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,560
they'll pass you by so

380
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,880
um try to do as much automation as you

381
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,120
can but nothing can replace a good

382
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,600
manual pen test and i would recommend

383
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,399
that

384
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,959
highly for every critical app where you

385
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:21,920
work

386
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,240
don't think that just automation is the

387
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,440
answer

388
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,519
um we want to get our application

389
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
security teams tested and trained

390
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,160
and there's lots of training that they

391
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,959
can have some of it even through owasp

392
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,920
but you talk to your fellow csos

393
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,000
and see what what training the their app

394
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,880
dev team has been happy with

395
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,040
make sure that every project is

396
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
reviewed by infosec throughout the

397
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,959
entire life cycle

398
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,800
there's plenty of free tools and

399
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,279
templates and frameworks from owasp uh

400
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,519
asvs is a great framework i highly

401
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,639
recommend everybody look to owasp

402
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,720
it's a de facto standard for a lot of

403
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,399
things moving forward with application

404
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,440
development

405
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,600
don't forget your security environment

406
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,560
in the physical aspect this quite often

407
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,800
is overlooked by people who cut their

408
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,399
teeth in the technical world right

409
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,160
physical solutions without infosec

410
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,360
involvement

411
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,519
recipe for a disaster

412
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,519
you know those physical access cards

413
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,959
that people use for security to get

414
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,720
around your buildings

415
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,079
the majority of them are easy to hack

416
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,839
yes and that part of the reason is

417
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,240
because the physical security folks

418
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,160
have not had ample training on the

419
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,480
technical trend security and again i'm

420
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,639
generalizing but we've seen this i've

421
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,800
read studies of people who have

422
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,440
successfully hacked many companies id

423
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,639
cards

424
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,680
um are you taking extra care to know

425
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,079
exactly who has access to your data

426
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,160
center whether they need it whether they

427
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,320
need 24 7 or just certain security

428
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,440
windows

429
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,279
that's important too

430
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,399
and

431
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,600
can people just walk out of your

432
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,839
building carry anything they want

433
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,000
you should have some kind of plan to

434
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,480
assess and no one's walking out with a

435
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,199
external hard drive or a pc it can be it

436
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,519
can be a big problem

437
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,360
monitoring

438
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
we talked about the large number of days

439
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,199
that go by before someone can even

440
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,440
identify a risk or a breach but you've

441
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,600
got to monitor your systems regularly

442
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,440
are you able to detect anomalies in your

443
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,920
network they're going to happen and that

444
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,480
can be the the lifesaver to avoid a

445
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,600
breach

446
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,639
you know do you know if you've been

447
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,440
compromised most companies don't

448
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,199
can and you able to detect strange

449
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,120
outbound behavior you know let's say

450
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,720
you're sending traffic to china and

451
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
north korea if you don't do business

452
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,360
there and that might be a red flag

453
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,040
all right um

454
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,360
what about for example if 50 users all

455
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,720
had their accounts locked after

456
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
unsuccessful login attempts if you just

457
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
answer your help desk calls

458
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,959
one at a time and take care of it but

459
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,800
you don't look for patterns or you don't

460
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,199
look for a level two or three review of

461
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,560
all the incidents that happen in your

462
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,279
network for correlation you potentially

463
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,639
could miss the next attack coming in

464
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,600
and

465
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,079
you know are you using an mssp

466
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,399
uh more and more companies are

467
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,480
but they are not all created equal so

468
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,959
please talk to your peers

469
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,639
i've heard stories where people have

470
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,320
said hey they saved us from a major

471
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,720
breach other people have said

472
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,399
we found out about this stuff before

473
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,720
then why am i paying all this money

474
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,839
so talk to your fellow csos

475
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,800
now reporting is very important

476
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,160
all right you're we're all running on

477
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,759
network vulnerability scans right

478
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,160
make sure you do your remediation plans

479
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,480
remediate and then rescan

480
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,680
don't wait for the next cycle

481
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
necessarily you want to make sure you're

482
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,480
addressing and locking down your systems

483
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,519
how about

484
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,000
looking at all the various tools that we

485
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,279
have and co and collaborating and

486
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,639
correlating this information for example

487
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,560
run your vulnerability scan

488
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,079
then look at your patch management

489
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,440
solution

490
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,079
and look at your endpoint security

491
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,520
solution

492
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,599
put all those reports together and

493
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,720
generate

494
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,679
an exception list for pcs

495
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,640
that

496
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,559
are showing up

497
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,640
on your vulnerability scan let's say but

498
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
are not showing up in your endpoint

499
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,359
protection scan hey patches that you

500
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,919
deploy don't always get installed

501
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,079
correctly and agents don't always get

502
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,240
installed correctly when i was doing

503
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,960
this we found that every time we ran it

504
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,160
we found

505
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
uh an install that just didn't complete

506
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,760
correctly which meant that the system

507
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,160
was vulnerable but without these types

508
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,559
of correlations you would never know it

509
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,000
okay always follow up on your

510
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,200
remediation efforts and rescan as i

511
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,799
mentioned

512
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,720
access management standards are very

513
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
important okay provisioning and

514
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
deprovisioning if someone leaves your

515
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
company are you sure

516
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,200
that they've lost every access they have

517
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,720
to every system

518
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,080
you sure

519
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,240
do you even know who has access to what

520
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,640
i've seen scope creep where people have

521
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
changed jobs and still retained access

522
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,200
to old systems that they should not have

523
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
access to any longer

524
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,520
periodically audit your systems to find

525
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,400
out

526
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,480
also mfa

527
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,440
every admin access needs to have

528
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,840
multi-factor authentication this is a

529
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,799
recipe for disaster if you don't do that

530
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,840
right you should also consider mfa for

531
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,480
every system definitely for every

532
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
critical system but possibly even for

533
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
all your systems right you assess your

534
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,039
risks and make that determination some

535
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,799
of this depends on culture where you

536
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,679
work

537
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,480
but admins and mission critical systems

538
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,240
there should be no discussion

539
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,120
right

540
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,600
and please talk to your system admins

541
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,240
make sure as they log in for normal work

542
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,400
during the normal day that they are not

543
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,160
logged in with admin privileges they

544
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,039
should have

545
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,039
multiple accounts a regular account and

546
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,200
an admin account and the admin account

547
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,039
is where they log in if they need to do

548
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,760
some admin work make changes to systems

549
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,600
but a lot of the everyday work does not

550
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,520
require that so please

551
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,440
you know that that's a people issue but

552
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,000
you need the support from the head of it

553
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,320
to make success on that one

554
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,600
hey did i mention patch before sure did

555
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
you know if i have to choose

556
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,200
the most important thing i'm telling you

557
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,120
today it's patching

558
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,679
having a good mature patching program

559
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,799
will mitigate at least 75 of the risk

560
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,799
where you work it should be the number

561
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,559
one on your list of security patrol

562
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,840
controls

563
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,480
um you know if equifax

564
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,400
had listened to that they would not have

565
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,679
been breached

566
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,039
the wannacry

567
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,559
ransomware attack would not have

568
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,880
happened if this was the case

569
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
so don't underestimate the importance of

570
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,120
a good patching program

571
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,480
you need to have

572
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,200
good incident response and that includes

573
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,720
a great plan

574
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,120
but this plan can't just sit there it's

575
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,000
got to be tested regularly and who's on

576
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,480
your incident response team

577
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,360
it better have the people from the right

578
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,640
locations

579
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,280
business representatives attorneys

580
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,440
public relations finance

581
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,039
it's the public relations team that's

582
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,480
going to be addressing your shareholders

583
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,559
in the public if you are breached and

584
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,720
you have to report it they can't they

585
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,159
can't just show up

586
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,559
they've got to plan this uh finance has

587
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,000
to be aware of it

588
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,159
and your attorneys of course

589
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,000
so don't forget these people

590
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,919
um in the 2019 ponyman report having an

591
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,919
incident response team reduces the cost

592
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,200
of a breach on the average by 360 000

593
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,440
and then there's encryption

594
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,480
please

595
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,960
consider if you can encrypting

596
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,280
everything everywhere where you work

597
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,880
i think everyone's encrypting everything

598
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,600
in transit but but data at rest is

599
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,679
vulnerable as well if someone breaks

600
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,039
into your system

601
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,440
they can grab it unless it's encrypted

602
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,880
and don't start getting fancy and

603
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,080
thinking you're going to build your own

604
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,640
encryption algorithms aes is the trusted

605
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,960
us government standard use that or

606
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,799
something even more secure but don't

607
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,240
make your own up

608
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,360
it's not a good strategy

609
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,280
key management is very important that

610
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,440
could be a big

611
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,400
gap in your entire security posture if

612
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,320
you don't rotate your keys have a good

613
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,200
plan and how those are accessed who has

614
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,880
access to them

615
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
don't storm on the same server as your

616
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,840
data right

617
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,159
don't use insecure protocols such as

618
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,960
telnet or ssl some people might still be

619
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,320
using ssl and tls 1.2 is the bare

620
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,640
minimum you should be using

621
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,280
another statistic from the 2019 pony

622
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,440
report is extensive use of encryption

623
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,520
reduces the average cost of data breach

624
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,039
by 360 000 as well

625
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,280
let's talk about disaster recovery

626
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,559
okay

627
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,679
too often business throws it to security

628
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,520
and says here you own this

629
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,679
well it's the business the key business

630
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,360
stakeholders that have to own it with

631
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,400
security taking lead perhaps right

632
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,080
um they've got to be involved you cannot

633
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,840
just build this on your own because they

634
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,400
have to identify the acceptable downtime

635
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,080
which is the recovery time objective and

636
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,679
they have to identify the acceptable

637
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,159
loss of data which is the recovery point

638
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,080
objective

639
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,919
this is the business risk they are

640
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,120
accepting

641
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,960
okay you've got to identify all the

642
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,200
mission critical systems prioritize them

643
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,320
figure out which ones you're going to

644
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,840
bring up first and how and how soon

645
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,200
of course you've got to align this with

646
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,360
the business continuity plan

647
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,919
and you've got to test this plan on a

648
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,919
regular basis don't just build it and

649
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,159
walk away and hope it works the day you

650
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,280
need it

651
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,679
because we know murphy lurks

652
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,600
and some companies are actually backing

653
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,120
up to the cloud

654
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,960
maybe not all their data but some you

655
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,120
might consider doing that

656
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,960
you've got to network and collaborate as

657
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,760
well

658
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,840
right the fact that you're here well not

659
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,240
here because this is a virtual event

660
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
but the fact that you're watching this

661
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,159
and you're participating

662
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,679
tells me

663
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,360
that you are networking and you believe

664
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
in the power of networking and

665
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,159
collaborating

666
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,559
i have learned so much

667
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,640
from my fellow csos over the decade and

668
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,559
a half that i've been doing this

669
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,080
it has shortened my development time for

670
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,159
my security plans tremendously i've

671
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,400
gotten contacts i've gotten

672
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,440
templates

673
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
solutions spreadsheets that help me be

674
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,720
successful from my fellow participants

675
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,799
right uh there's fbi infraguard

676
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,400
definitely if you're not a member of a

677
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,320
local oahs chapter you've got to do that

678
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,360
there are other

679
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,919
organizations out there as well

680
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,840
maybe you want to form a new group a new

681
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,520
meetup but there are a lot of local

682
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,080
meetups where you are once this covert

683
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,000
19 mess

684
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,760
you know clears up

685
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,679
look for local meetups for areas of

686
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,679
importance to you and you'll be amazed

687
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,360
at how many you'll find there's

688
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,880
thousands now

689
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,559
keep learning of course

lots of more vendor webcasts let's be

695
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,200
honest at all wasp we are

696
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,240
strangely adherents of pure vendor

697
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,200
neutrality so you will see great content

698
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,120
here without me or anyone selling

699
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,000
anything but a lot of them do so just be

700
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,159
aware of the difference there's a lot of

701
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,559
good blogs that you can read check out

702
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,159
podcasts

703
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,720
training ongoing training life is about

704
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,880
learning and training so please continue

705
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,080
to do that

706
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,520
uh yes books i don't know how many

707
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
people own books anymore but there's a

708
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,679
lot of good stuff that you can learn

709
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,840
linkedin and twitter leak uh

710
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,919
links are very important

711
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,559
i start my day by opening up twitter and

712
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,640
linkedin and i can't tell you how many

713
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,400
times the links that are in there

714
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,240
are just filled with great information

715
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,640
both about the latest news

716
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,480
but also by things i could take back to

717
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,240
work and act on immediately

718
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,200
this one is near and dear to me

719
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,440
we have a huge gap in the number of

720
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,159
qualified people in security

721
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,240
we have a huge gap

722
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,360
in diversity as well

723
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,559
if we can address diversity by making a

724
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,200
more open and rewarding

725
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,400
environment

726
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,480
for people of diversity

727
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,880
this helps fill the some of the gap that

728
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,799
we have and we'll be getting

729
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,320
in this field

730
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,120
um we have to have a warm and welcoming

731
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,480
it's about attitude it's about

732
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,080
perception

733
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,159
i'll i'll give you an example

734
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,919
i've seen some

735
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,320
things written for an opening

736
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,240
where they talk about war and let's kill

737
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
the competition and let's do and these

738
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,159
are military terms and they don't always

739
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,200
go over well with with certain people uh

740
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,400
some women

741
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,320
would prefer a more

742
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,400
and and some men as well would perform a

743
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,200
more

744
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,919
teamwork oriented approach rather than

745
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,880
kill kill kill so just be careful of

746
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,279
your language students deserve a chance

747
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,279
they're the next generation let's help

748
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,840
them mentor them speak at schools

749
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,320
there are cyber competitions we can do

750
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
and consider uh you know helping with

751
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,400
curriculums a lot of the problem

752
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,720
particularly in application security

753
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,440
is that these coders learn how to code

754
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,600
in school that does not have enough

755
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,760
security baked into the curriculum we

756
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,559
can help with that

757
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,480
most importantly

758
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,720
when i saved this for one of my last

759
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,480
slides

760
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,120
the executive team is the key to your

761
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,000
success you cannot do this on your own

762
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
all right are you advising them with the

763
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,279
key risks

764
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,320
that they need to make decisions right

765
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,919
have you matched your cyber security

766
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,919
strategy to the organization's business

767
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,799
risks do you know the business risk do

768
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,080
you speak businesses as i said right

769
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,000
don't get involved in a dialogue with

770
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,120
the business

771
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,279
about anything other than risk and money

772
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,120
don't show them reports with how many

773
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,559
attacks you've had how many

774
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,000
infiltrations

775
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,799
just talk risk and money all right

776
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,159
and then of course there's cyber

777
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,159
insurance right but here's a word of

778
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,919
caution about that

779
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,760
oftentimes you might need a secondary

780
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,600
policy because the first one won't

781
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,360
insure you for enough of your risk or

782
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,880
enough of your data

783
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,679
right

784
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,799
also

785
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,039
there is a form that every insurer makes

786
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,520
you sign off on that's saying are you

787
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,360
doing this this this this and this if

788
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,360
somebody just signs off about that but

789
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,440
you're really not doing it what will you

790
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
get if you're breached

791
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,600
the big o

792
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,120
so please

793
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,880
