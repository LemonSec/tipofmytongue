arcsan is now digital.ai

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,759
join us at our booth in the virtual expo

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,080
hall to learn how our app protection

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,080
white box cryptography and threat

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,080
analytics solutions can help you stay

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,320
ahead of the evolving threat landscape

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,439
hello and welcome everyone and thank you

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,920
for registering for the ovas global

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,920
appsec 2020

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
and for joining our session on

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,599
understanding the weakest link in the

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,960
hood the eol software and a journey to

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,320
secure it

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,399
uh before we begin let me introduce

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,760
myself my name is anuprita and i work as

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,320
an application security sme for j2

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,000
global

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,800
i also lead women of security that is

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,120
woosek new jersey chapter

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,520
and currently serving as a director of

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
security awareness for protect us kids

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
foundation

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
so i introduced uh i got i was

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,160
introduced to security uh domain back in

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,000
2014 and it instantly became my passion

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,560
uh maybe because of

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,799
my inherent observant nature or a

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,840
detective nature and from them um i

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,560
started learning new skills and

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,799
uh being in the security domain talking

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,280
to a lot of people uh you know in the in

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,360
the security domain itself

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,880
uh and that was about myself um to move

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,479
forward with the

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,840
talk

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,799
let's get started

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,240
so talking about end of life software or

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
outdated software

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,640
not knowing when and how to transform

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,200
from one system to another can be both

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,000
confusing and stressful and this is why

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,600
we are here today

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,439
our today's talk is focused on

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,759
understanding the weakest link yes

45
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,399
you're right the end of life software

46
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,200
and the various strategies to identify

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
and secure it

48
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,399
now moving forward we'll see the end of

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,360
life philosophy to understand how this

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,840
philosophy gets to where we are today

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,959
because it's

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,038
it's not what just happened yesterday or

53
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,400
today it's been happening something it's

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,879
been happening and been going around for

55
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,599
a long time and the journey is

56
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,560
very important to understand

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,760
and in any journey it is important to

58
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,920
understand your current situation your

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,319
current position and the risk and

60
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,839
threats associated with it

61
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,319
then at the end we will see various

62
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,640
prevention and mitigation strategies

63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,160
that will help you

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,920
uh secure your end of life software

65
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,599
so let's move forward understanding the

66
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,480
end of life philosophy

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,959
um as we have seen you know quite a lot

68
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,720
of evolution starting from 70s and 80s

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,280
of all the mainframes then evolution of

70
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,800
many computers then pcs came along and

71
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,200
then servers networks and then

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
sharepoint

73
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,680
uh begin to evolve which somewhat you

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,400
know affected or impacted what where we

75
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,000
are today

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,640
and when we talk about end of life and

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,680
when we talk about things like cloud

78
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,040
or laptops tablets and iphones

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,560
and apps

80
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,080
this is going

81
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,319
on this is going on for

82
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,440
quite a while now and it it's not that

83
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
it started like 10 years ago or maybe 20

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,200
years ago

85
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,040
its way it has started on its ongoing

86
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,599
evolution since the time it started way

87
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,720
back

88
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,000
then

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,599
and it leads to

90
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,599
uh it leaves us

91
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,040
to the point

92
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,080
and the concepts that we need to know

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
the very first concept is that software

94
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,200
change is inevitable

95
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,120
and it is inevitable with each

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,480
advancement of hardware

97
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,360
when we talk about advancement we also

98
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,320
talk about the interconnectivity between

99
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,478
software

100
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:21,759
interconnectivity between software and

101
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,960
hardware

102
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,360
and if that advancement with that

103
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,479
hardware fails then it directly impacts

104
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,599
the software itself

105
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,400
now we'll see how software has become a

106
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
very important thing

107
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,160
when making an important business

108
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,960
decisions

109
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,280
now if you want to compare or if you

110
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,600
want to if you want your

111
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
company to be unique

112
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,919
technology or software is the one that

113
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,560
will make you different or make you

114
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,600
unique from the rest of the companies

115
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,840
so

116
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
company

117
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,320
okay i need to do that the second point

118
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,320
again

119
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,199
is it

120
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,600
okay

121
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,720
yep

122
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,840
um the second point

123
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,280
for the this sliders very important one

124
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,080
that nowadays what we are seeing is that

125
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,280
software is the key in making important

126
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,039
business decisions

127
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,759
um and what type of technology is used

128
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,759
to help companies

129
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,160
um and

130
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,280
again the second point

131
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,919
um and the second point is that

132
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,639
nowadays software has become the key in

133
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,919
making important business decisions

134
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,600
and hardware has just become the

135
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,199
commodity

136
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,360
when we talk about differentiating your

137
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,160
business with the rest we also talk

138
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,880
about or we mainly talk about

139
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,039
what the software that you're trying to

140
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,120
offer to your customers

141
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
it is very important and it

142
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
differentiates

143
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,400
your company and makes it unique

144
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,199
whereas when we talk about the hardware

145
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,919
the best example for this would be um

146
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,080
our phones and laptops

147
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,160
according to the research we tend to

148
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,880
change on our electronics once in every

149
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,560
three to five years

150
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,560
or some electronics may be changed in um

151
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,039
you know maybe me

152
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,720
or they can survive more than that

153
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,919
now

154
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,440
if you calculate that the rate of change

155
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,720
is between um between three to eight

156
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,479
years approximately

157
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,599
and

158
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,240
we don't even think about changing the

159
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,120
the hardware or maybe um you know the

160
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,240
the phones or the laptops or electronics

161
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,479
um if they are working fine if we are

162
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,800
installing um if we are regularly

163
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,520
installing the the softwares and we are

164
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,360
keeping it patched

165
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,280
and if they are working fine

166
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,160
so

167
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,560
the changes what really changes is the

168
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,039
software when it's kept up to date and

169
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,479
the latest updates with security patches

170
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,479
coming to the third point

171
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,360
a good software is very hard to build

172
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,479
because

173
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,960
because of the number of reasons

174
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,919
um there can be you know uh there can be

175
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,919
a lot of efforts that

176
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,120
that companies put while understanding

177
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,520
the requirement behind that software

178
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,479
or

179
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,080
what the the customers exactly need when

180
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,479
company talk of company talks about the

181
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,560
good software

182
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,879
and this process this entire process

183
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,479
takes too long

184
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,960
and it obviously costs too much

185
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,919
and most of the times um the software's

186
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,879
failed to perform as expected because

187
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,720
there can be number of reasons because

188
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,879
the the

189
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,360
research has not done properly there can

190
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,240
be budgetary issues as well as the

191
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,199
resource issues

192
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,120
if we compare the cost of software

193
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,720
versus cost of hardware then

194
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,759
the cost of commodity and its total cost

195
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,240
has dropped dramatically over the years

196
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,679
now

197
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,159
talking about the last point the rate of

198
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,399
change in technology and software is

199
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,360
brutal and forgiving

200
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,800
this is because

201
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,920
um

202
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,760
the rate of change in technology

203
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,160
especially interdependency

204
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,880
and it's outdated

205
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,080
if that's okay i need to um redo this

206
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,200
uh the rate of change in technology and

207
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,519
software has become brutal

208
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,320
as you see the the software keeps coming

209
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,399
in the market and

210
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,279
if

211
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,160
the software that your company is using

212
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
has a lot of interdependencies with

213
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,920
other softwares

214
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,160
and if that software

215
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
is going in the

216
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,360
end of life phase it becomes challenging

217
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,640
for the company to migrate or

218
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,279
to migrate to other software or replace

219
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,920
or upgrade that software with some other

220
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,320
uh available software in the market and

221
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,480
that is the reason um it is very

222
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,800
difficult to keep pace with the changing

223
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,040
technology

224
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,160
now moving forward with understanding

225
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,000
what end of life really means is

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,720
um especially when you talk about

227
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,360
companies who are running um the

228
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,240
softwares from last 10 to 20 years

229
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,519
uh so to answer this um i would like to

230
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,120
go a bit back and understand um and let

231
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,200
you um

232
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,399
i need to redo this

233
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,920
okay sorry

234
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
um

235
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,839
now um

236
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,480
let's move forward and understand what

237
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,360
does this end of life really means

238
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
especially uh when we talk about

239
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,320
businesses which are running uh

240
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,079
systems or software

241
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,000
um from last

242
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,800
from past 10 to 15 years

243
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,720
to answer this

244
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,519
every product has a life cycle

245
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,519
and that begins when the software is

246
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,640
released

247
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,240
and it ends

248
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,200
when the developer or the vendor decides

249
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,519
to stop creating software updates or

250
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,240
security patches

251
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,399
this transition is quite common in the

252
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,200
tech industry and is also known as

253
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,839
software development life cycle or

254
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,839
in short

255
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,720
sdlc

256
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,760
so when the software um goes into the

257
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
out of date phase

258
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,240
or or the decline phase

259
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,440
there are some cases um or some

260
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,279
things that might happen

261
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,399
the first

262
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,440
one is

263
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,079
the developer or the manufacturer no

264
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,560
longer support the product

265
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
if it's still offered by the original

266
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,279
developer or the manufacturer then it

267
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,640
will be a paid support that can even uh

268
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,480
which can even be uh paper our support

269
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,040
the second one is the end of life

270
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,240
software will no longer get updated to

271
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,600
new problems

272
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,279
so if there is any security

273
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,440
vulnerabilities um

274
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,959
are discovered

275
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,680
they are not fixed and may leave your

276
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,560
computer your network or your company

277
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,519
vulnerable to cyber attacks

278
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,000
we will see more on the cyber attacks

279
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
later part in the presentation

280
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,560
the third one is the end of life

281
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,240
the third one is the end of life

282
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,560
that will no longer have replacement

283
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,880
parts manufactured

284
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,279
so it may be possible that there could

285
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,360
be access inventory

286
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,920
um for a few years

287
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,040
after the

288
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,000
end of life and however

289
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,160
once the paths are wrapped

290
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,399
perhaps once the parts run out

291
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,120
you may have no options for repair

292
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,360
through the manufacturer and that's what

293
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,800
really end of life means

294
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,720
moving to the next slide

295
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,200
now that we have seen the philosophy of

296
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,920
uh and the definition of end of life

297
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,560
let's check how to identify uh your

298
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,240
current state

299
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,360
um with the end of life software

300
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,839
now these are the questions that

301
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,839
you must be aware of

302
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,160
uh because you were possibly heavily

303
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,720
involved um at the time of purchasing

304
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,399
your software of

305
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,600
your company or you must have inherited

306
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,680
these situations and could be dealing

307
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,440
with uh the things that say five years

308
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
uh that are that must be five years

309
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,839
older or ten years older or maybe older

310
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,040
than that

311
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,880
but it's really important for you to

312
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,200
understand these things um when we talk

313
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,519
about understanding your current state

314
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,880
with end of life system

315
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,000
uh the first thing is that um

316
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,519
understanding

317
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,480
the latest or the current version of the

318
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,279
product that is heavily utilized within

319
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,920
your organization

320
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,079
the second one is

321
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,439
what is the current version

322
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
when was the current version that was

323
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,839
implemented

324
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,639
uh and the third one is the next is

325
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,040
how customized your solution is

326
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,040
now when we talk about customization

327
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,680
if your customer if you're um sorry i

328
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,638
need to do this again

329
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,160
okay sorry

330
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,079
um

331
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,639
i'll i'll start in the beginning uh from

332
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,199
this slide

333
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,000
okay so um when we talk about end of

334
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,160
life there is a possibility that you

335
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,079
were heavily involved at the time of

336
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,160
purchasing your software or for your

337
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,360
company

338
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,240
uh or some of you might have inherited

339
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,399
these situations and you could be

340
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,560
dealing with the with these things from

341
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,720
say last five years

342
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,279
ten years or maybe longer than that

343
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,959
but it's really important for you to

344
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,760
know these things because they all have

345
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,480
an impact later down the road while

346
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,400
taking decisions for your company

347
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,079
[Music]

348
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,079
so for the software first thing you need

349
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,000
to know is that

350
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,040
what

351
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,160
the latest release or current version

352
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,800
of the product that is being utilized by

353
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,360
your company

354
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,839
when was that version implemented

355
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,399
and how customized the solution is the

356
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,160
more customized it is

357
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,880
the

358
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,199
difficult it is or the challenging it

359
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,920
would be for your company to migrate to

360
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
some other uh

361
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,320
solution it will be

362
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,639
um the next thing is that

363
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,560
when we talk about vendor

364
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
vendor is something that creates the

365
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,480
software

366
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,199
and they have and while creating it

367
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,839
they have all the release and a software

368
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,800
release and upgrade policies written

369
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,758
um and

370
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,839
i need to redo this point

371
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,079
um the next point is when we talk about

372
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,199
vendor

373
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,120
a vendor is someone who creates the

374
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,480
software

375
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,440
and while creating a software they also

376
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,680
create software release and upgrade

377
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,479
policies for that implemented solution

378
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,320
now

379
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,800
do you know that

380
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,000
what's the specific current application

381
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and how your current version will be

382
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,480
supported by the window

383
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:12,870
um

384
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,440
[Music]

385
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,199
i think i'm gonna do this again

386
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,239
i am so sorry

387
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,720
okay

388
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,759
the the the next point is

389
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,399
when we talk about the software vendor a

390
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,320
software vendor is someone who creates

391
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,519
the software

392
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,160
and while creating a software it also

393
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,320
they also document a software release

394
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,560
and upgrade policies for the implemented

395
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,079
solution

396
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,600
now your

397
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,120
if you want to understand your current

398
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,440
state with end of life system it is very

399
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,600
important for you to

400
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,800
know

401
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,040
the the release and upgrade policy

402
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,519
details and implement implementation

403
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,839
details specifically for your

404
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,600
application

405
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,039
it also

406
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,319
documents

407
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,119
the the currently implemented solution

408
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,098
uh support details um

409
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,319
[Music]

410
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,520
and it is

411
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,000
very important when taking decision

412
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,199
about your end of life system

413
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,120
another important point is that

414
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,839
and you need to know is

415
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,840
if your company is using a niche

416
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,039
software this is very important to

417
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,200
understand because not all companies are

418
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,240
mainstream businesses the solution that

419
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,880
you're trying to sell the solution that

420
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,039
they are trying to sell maybe because

421
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,240
someone had invested time and effort

422
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,760
into

423
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,480
and that no longer being supported

424
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
and they have just decided to to

425
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,720
maintain that whatever

426
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
maintained whatever they have

427
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,640
or some niche vendors might have not

428
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,679
even

429
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,960
might have

430
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
might not even have necessary financial

431
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,240
debts

432
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,440
um resources or capacity to support a

433
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,400
long-term investment

434
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
um in this case

435
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,880
it is

436
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,919
it is definite that your company is

437
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,559
running at some serious risks of the

438
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,880
vendors not being supportive enough

439
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,360
um in the incidences when something is

440
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,640
broken and you need to fix them uh you

441
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,039
need to fix it um

442
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,280
or implement it before the deadline

443
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,200
coming to the next slide

444
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,880
now that we have seen our ways you can

445
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
waste to identify your current state

446
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,120
with the end of life software let's move

447
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,280
forward and understand if it's right

448
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,559
time to move on or change or upgrade

449
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,760
with the software

450
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,160
the default um

451
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,200
[Music]

452
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,480
okay i need to do this again

453
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,280
now moving to the next slide

454
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,440
now that we have seen uh ways to

455
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,000
identify your current state with end of

456
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,440
life software

457
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,840
let's move forward to understand if it's

458
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,080
right time to move on

459
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,440
and change

460
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,559
or upgrade or with the latest software

461
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
the very first thing when you decide to

462
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,880
move on

463
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,960
from current software is when you

464
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,200
receive an end-of-life notice from your

465
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,559
vendor

466
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,880
now this is particularly um

467
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,679
when

468
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,559
you have an on-premise solution and now

469
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,799
the industry is moving

470
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,280
to entirely uh

471
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,000
now industry is moving entirely uh on

472
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,760
the cloud solutions performance-based

473
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,440
solutions

474
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,679
uh on the cloud bay oh

475
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,200
i need to do this first point again

476
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,320
okay

477
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,120
the very first thing when you decide to

478
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,520
move on from your

479
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,480
current software is when you receive an

480
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,960
end of life notice from your vendor

481
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,840
this is particularly when uh you have

482
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,880
on premise software and now the industry

483
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
is entirely moving

484
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,039
on cloud solutions performance based

485
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,200
product that will change a lot of

486
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,400
aspects

487
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,880
um including the hiring and the

488
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,320
investments and whatnot

489
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,360
the next point is a very important one

490
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,960
and as

491
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,360
we move forward with the time and

492
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,799
technology

493
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,799
how are we going to find talent to

494
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,799
support the legacy software and the

495
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,000
businesses

496
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,039
if people are going to retire or maybe

497
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,520
an employee decides to move for a better

498
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
opportunity

499
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,280
so it is always a risk in keeping

500
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,360
out-of-date systems running in the

501
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,600
environment as it's just a matter of

502
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,880
understanding

503
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,159
what the risk is for a longer term if

504
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,360
you decide

505
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,640
to

506
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,240
be with the end of life system you are

507
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,640
just thinking about the short-term goals

508
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,679
of

509
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,039
um not having to decide what the

510
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,760
workforce or what the budgetary issues

511
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,919
are

512
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,720
then moving to another point

513
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,640
these things also apply while retaining

514
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,080
your employees

515
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,640
when understanding what the impact of

516
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,960
current technology will be on your

517
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,320
workforce

518
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,880
today's employees expect dynamic and

519
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,840
real-time access to any location

520
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,919
especially in the current situation

521
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,720
where everyone is working remotely and

522
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,039
need access to the real-time data and

523
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,799
devices

524
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,520
with an outdated technology this process

525
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,120
becomes difficult

526
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,520
and that is where it fails to meet the

527
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,480
user functionality experience and often

528
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,400
becomes a cause of frustration

529
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,799
okay so let's move forward um on the

530
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,400
next slide understanding the risk

531
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,880
factors associated with end of life

532
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,799
software

533
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,679
now uh well you can still use the end of

534
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,480
life um after its expiration

535
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,880
you could put your company to a broad

536
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,679
range of risks that includes

537
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,440
first is compliance

538
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,760
if you store sensitive data on end of

539
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,799
life software you may be not you may not

540
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,159
be a compliant uh

541
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,080
okay i need to do the first point again

542
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,039
okay

543
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,679
uh the first one is compliance

544
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,919
if you store sensitive data on end of

545
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,360
life software

546
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,000
you may be running

547
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,080
a non-compliant system and

548
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,840
again first point

549
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,320
uh the very first point is the

550
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,919
compliance

551
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,679
if you store sensitive data on

552
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,080
end-of-life software you may not be

553
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,840
compliant with the applicable laws and

554
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,640
regulations

555
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,320
including hipaa

556
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,960
socks and pci

557
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,799
the another one is lawsuits

558
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,280
the another one is lawsuits

559
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,760
keeping sensitive data such as customers

560
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,799
pii or phi within software that has

561
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,679
reached its end of life is unsafe

562
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,320
because it's vulnerable to cyber attacks

563
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,720
as end of life system is the weakest

564
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,120
link in your in the company's

565
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,559
environment

566
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,799
and if any company experiences data

567
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,120
breach that compromises

568
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,000
um their customers data personal

569
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,200
information it could face legal issues

570
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,440
big fines as well as a company shutdown

571
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,840
the next one is no security patches and

572
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,320
upgrades

573
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,520
because end of life software no longer

574
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,720
receives bug fixes and security upgrades

575
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,960
your company's security

576
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,760
can be totally compromised

577
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,799
um if hackers and you know competitors

578
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,120
can easily infiltrate

579
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,400
your software using various malwares or

580
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,600
to steam sensitive information

581
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,039
the next one is

582
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,679
higher operational cost

583
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,320
as your company technology

584
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,480
as your company's technology becomes

585
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,679
outdated

586
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,320
the cost of maintaining um

587
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,159
is increased

588
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,720
um okay i need to do this at the point

589
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,960
again

590
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,480
higher operational cost

591
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,320
as a company's technology becomes

592
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,799
outdated the cost of maintaining

593
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,240
increases

594
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,720
that can quickly become a burden to your

595
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,480
company

596
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,600
this is especially um true when it comes

597
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,400
to the current situation where companies

598
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,440
are

599
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,039
more prone to

600
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,000
um keeping their budget uh

601
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,640
budget tight as well as um

602
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,919
reducing

603
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,799
trying to reduce um the the over exa

604
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,200
expenses

605
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,720
so um

606
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,039
the support the extended support is not

607
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,520
cheap especially customers who may want

608
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,679
to apply uh for the

609
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,559
these patches to multiple pcs

610
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,840
and devices they are even more expensive

611
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,240
when you talk about the professional and

612
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,720
the enterprise versions

613
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,200
uh the next point is reduce performance

614
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,919
and productivity

615
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,400
as you know an outdated software are

616
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,559
slowly deteriorates

617
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,120
over the time and it doesn't perform as

618
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,480
efficiently

619
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,080
um

620
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,520
as before

621
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,000
it reduces the productivity and puts

622
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,159
your company at a risk of losing

623
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,760
sensitive data

624
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,360
or incurring costly shutdowns

625
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,240
and downtimes

626
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,600
another

627
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,840
point is risk of hackers malwares and

628
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,799
apts

629
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,120
as we saw earlier software that no

630
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
longer receives security upgrades and

631
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,559
patches is the weakest link

632
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,320
and can become target of hackers

633
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,360
malwares and advanced persistent threats

634
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,000
of course we will see that um

635
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,159
of course we will see this in security

636
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,600
threats later in the slides

637
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,640
so now that we have seen um end of life

638
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,360
software uh let's check some of the

639
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,720
software that made headlines in 2020 uh

640
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,320
in the tech world

641
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,679
the first one is microsoft windows 7.

642
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,159
microsoft announced that the windows 7

643
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,080
operating system will no longer be

644
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,279
supported after january 14th

645
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,000
this year and anyone wishing to retain

646
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,960
their windows 7 platform will require to

647
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,880
pay a premium

648
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,799
for each device

649
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,520
um to continue receiving to the security

650
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,440
patches and upgrades

651
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,799
and support

652
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,120
with the cost that will double every

653
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,080
year

654
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,240
so according to the reports

655
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,399
uh during the first year of end of life

656
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,760
cycle windows 7 pro will cost 50 dollars

657
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,840
per device and the enterprise will cost

658
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,279
25

659
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,080
whereas in the next year

660
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,120
the cost will double and it will it

661
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,760
would cost

662
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,640
hundred dollars for the pro version

663
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,120
whereas fifty dollars for the enterprise

664
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,520
and in the next and the last year

665
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,480
it would again double with

666
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,520
two hundred dollars for the pro version

667
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,720
and hundred dollars for the enterprise

668
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,840
version for device

669
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,880
it's same as python 2.

670
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,120
um the python 2 recently uh um i need to

671
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,760
do this again

672
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,960
uh for the python 2 that finally reached

673
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,200
its end of life at the beginning of this

674
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,559
year um that leaves you know some of the

675
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,120
companies um in on the exposure who

676
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,840
didn't plan the migration beforehand

677
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
and there could be several reasons for

678
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,559
it

679
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,240
um such as you know um such as companies

680
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,320
didn't know about the end of life phase

681
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,200
second can be uh companies

682
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,520
um okay i need to do this again

683
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,600
okay

684
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,960
um

685
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,600
uh then talking about python 2

686
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,640
um

687
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,200
python 2 as well finally reached its end

688
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,840
of life at the beginning of this year

689
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,320
uh that leaves the companies the

690
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,640
exposure who didn't plan the migration

691
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,240
before

692
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,919
the reason

693
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:02,720
uh

694
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,240
for this could be

695
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,960
not planning the migration could vary

696
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,919
such as some components uh work only on

697
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,159
python 2 and it's not available on

698
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,080
python 3.

699
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,799
second could be the size of code bases

700
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,520
and dependencies is too much and it is

701
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,399
becoming a challenge for cust for the

702
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,520
companies to migrate to another solution

703
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,240
or to upgrade to the to python 3

704
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,640
or companies are still in the phase of

705
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,679
learning python 3 skills

706
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,640
and the fourth reason can be that the

707
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,600
companies are not even aware that python

708
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,120
2 has become an outdated version and the

709
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,640
security updates are on dead halt

710
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,600
these end of life um software might be a

711
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,480
victim um to some secures some serious

712
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,440
security threats and that is true for

713
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,320
all the uh software's that

714
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,480
went to end of life state

715
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,279
um this year

716
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,240
um i think i

717
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,760
would need to do again

718
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,360
um but let me just check which one

719
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,120
okay i'll again start with python 2.

720
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,679
okay uh talking about python 2

721
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,919
um python 2

722
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,559
as well finally reached its end of life

723
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,200
at the beginning of this year

724
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,000
that leaves us that leaves the company

725
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,039
uh some companies on the exposure of the

726
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,120
security threats because

727
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,960
there are many companies that didn't

728
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,919
plan the migration before um before it

729
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,480
went um outdated

730
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,240
and there could be different reasons for

731
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,760
it uh it can be due to um that the

732
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,960
components that python 2 offered

733
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,799
is not offered in python 3. this there

734
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,960
can be reasons such as

735
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,880
the code base and dependencies are so um

736
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,760
intervened that it is it's becoming a

737
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,480
challenging for the companies to migrate

738
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,279
to some other solution or to the latest

739
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,880
version of

740
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,960
of python

741
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,760
there can be a reason such as um some

742
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,360
companies are

743
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,880
even um

744
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,919
learning are currently learning the the

745
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,919
you know in the learning phase of python

746
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,360
3

747
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,399
and

748
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,120
maybe some companies are not even aware

749
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,679
that the system or the the software has

750
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,799
become out of date

751
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,760
and now

752
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,799
uh and and that is true for all the um

753
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,360
all the software's listed here

754
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,039
um and now it's the security updates are

755
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,840
on dead halt

756
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,080
these running end of life software might

757
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,399
be a victim to some serious security

758
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,039
threats even more than what it was in

759
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,519
previous phase of its life cycle

760
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,679
and now let's check uh let's check out

761
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,440
all the possible security threats with

762
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,000
my co-speaker and friend astha and thank

763

cyber preserve

774
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,519
here in cyber preserve we are working as

775
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,440
an er we are providing some cyber

776
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,519
security mentorship program which are

777
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,679
low cost professionals who want to

778
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,440
transition their career into cyber

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,159
security my mentorship program is free

780
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,320
for the college students along with this

781
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
mentorship program coming back to

782
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,799
communities i'm the lead of new york

783
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,600
chapter for infosec girls and an active

784
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,720
member of ovas nyc chapter along with

785
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,320
women in apsec

786
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,360
so as anuprita well described and

787
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,919
explained about the philosophy concept

788
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,960
and risk around eol softwares let's now

789
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,360
discuss some of the possible security

790
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,760
threats to the eul softwares and what

791
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,159
should be the best possible prevention

792
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,279
and mitigation strategies

793
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,279
possible security threats

794
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,760
as risks are associated with eul

795
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,799
softwares and if you can see this

796
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,279
possible paraphrase in this slide which

797
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,919
clearly mentioned by a blog known as

798
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,840
trend micro in 2015 that while windows

799
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,559
xp end of life process did not

800
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,600
precipitate any major cyber security

801
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,360
related event

802
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,799
stud like

803
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,440
uh the scrutiny given as a case study

804
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,600
and how to prevent vulnerable like

805
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,480
vulnerabilities for example

806
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,240
even though what they are trying to

807
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,600
mention here is even though in 2015

808
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,840
windows xp had become an end-of-life

809
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,960
software and there was no possible known

810
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,119
cyber security threat

811
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,839
little did we know that in future when

812
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,918
2017 hit

813
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,119
cyber threat actors they utilize this

814
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,520
vulnerability one of the vulnerabilities

815
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,800
in windows xp operating system and

816
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,359
leverage that vulnerability in the very

817
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,199
well-known warner crib

818
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,760
ransomware in 2017.

819
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,960
now the good point and to pay here as an

820
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,000
attention is that even though you will

821
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,918
see that some of the

822
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,320
some of these end-of-life softwares they

823
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,800
have not yet reported any possible

824
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,480
security threats we never know in future

825
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,599
how threat actors hacker nation state

826
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,560
actors can leverage these end of life

827
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,359
software's vulnerabilities into a

828
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,480
possible threat and this possible threat

829
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,200
associated with vulnerability can lead

830
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,480
to a great risk rating and we all know

831
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,359
risk vulnerability and threat they are

832
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,599
all well related to each other so if

833
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,440
there is a risk around end end-of-life

834
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,760
softwares there can be a possible

835
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,160
vulnerabilities around these softwares

836
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,240
in the current time or in the future

837
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,440
time which can be easily exploitable by

838
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,839
the threat actors in future

839
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:28,880
now

840
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,520
now coming to the some security threats

841
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,839
these particular cyber security threats

842
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,240
they can go from minor version to a

843
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,280
major version minor means like virus

844
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,320
worms

845
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,440
trojan horses some kind of ddos attacks

846
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,599
but what about some major attacks like

847
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,200
zero day ransomware of 2017 was a major

848
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,880
hit four days and 200 000 computers were

849
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,440
attacked it wasn't a joke it's a serious

850
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,160
matter and that's why it becomes really

851
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,880
important for us to cater these

852
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,119
end-of-life softwares very very

853
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,920
seriously we have seen organizations in

854
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
the past even in the currency like in

855
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,480
the current times they are not upgrading

856
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,400
they are not replacing these softwares

857
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,800
and application reason being

858
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,560
like their business there will be some

859
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,800
kind of this business disruption they

860
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,480
don't want to invest certain amount of

861
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,040
money or other possible

862
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,200
their own business reasons but the point

863
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,000
is if you are ignoring them from time to

864
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,760
time you can be the victim of another

865
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,000
major cyber threat due to these end of

866
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,880
life softwares and interestingly

867
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,599
tell me what you think about advanced

868
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,640
persistent threats

869
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,359
now when i say advanced persistent

870
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,759
threats

871
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,920
yes

872
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,720
just

873
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,720
okay

874
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,560
so coming to advanced persistent threats

875
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,240
what are your thoughts advanced

876
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,000
persistent threats have been hitting

877
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,200
organizations globally since early 2000

878
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,760
and if you notice if you have read about

879
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,040
the 2013 mandiant report about apt-1

880
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,520
attacks it clearly mentioned that the

881
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,359
threat actors they utilized one of these

882
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,440
tactics like in their tactic techniques

883
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,040
and procedures they utilize

884
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,599
vulnerabilities from eos or fears and

885
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,400
this is not a joke because apt one

886
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,560
attack which was an advanced persistent

887
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,640
threat actually

888
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,160
remained in network for certain victim

889
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,119
systems for more than an year and that

890
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,599
was the average amount of time and

891
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,839
interestingly if you do not know what

892
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,200
are apts in case of apts the threat

893
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,400
actors they utilize multiple tactics

894
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,119
techniques and procedures to attack a

895
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,079
target and those attacks are not just

896
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,400
limited to one organization to

897
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,760
organization but their scope is expanded

898
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,720
to a whole nation these advanced

899
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,320
persistent threats they have been

900
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,240
supposedly they have been found out that

901
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,160
they are based on nation state attacks

902
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,680
they are sponsored by states and

903
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,400
governments and their aim is not only to

904
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,640
impact one organization or state but

905
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,920
majorly attacked them from the basis of

906
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,880
either economically affecting them or

907
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,839
like

908
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,040
bringing their reputation down so it has

909
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,839
major major impacts and

910
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,320
if we keep our eyes on some median

911
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,280
values of dwell time of threat actors in

912
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,800
2013 around in 2013 the dwell time which

913
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,359
is the average time an attacker remains

914
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,480
in the network undetected in the from

915
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,560
the concept of advanced persistent

916
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,920
threats that dwell time is at that time

917
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,920
around 2013 was around 197 days

918
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,440
even though our cyber security

919
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,680
professionals we we as professionals we

920
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,839
are becoming smart we are working hard

921
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,920
we are we are getting new techniques we

922
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,599
are increasing our controls we are

923
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,520
increasing defense in depth but the

924
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,480
point is we have got this number down to

925
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,440
just 56. still 56 56 days an attacker is

926
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,640
in your network undetected and if the

927
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,200
reason for that attacker being in your

928
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,480
network is an end of life software risk

929
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,119
and one ability then man

930
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,280
the vulnerability was in front of you

931
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,760
the risks were in front of you but you

932
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,640
didn't actually upgrade it patched them

933
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,280
and implemented controls at that time

934
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,320
that's why it reached that level and

935
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
these topics especially these advanced

936
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,560
threats it's it's a situation of panic

937
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,800
and fear not only because

938
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,200
as far as i know all of us as

939
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,480
professionals all of like currently all

940
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,560
organizations they have their in-house

941
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,880
security teams everybody investing money

942
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,960
in security and everybody wants to be

943
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,160
secure and if we are not taking care of

944
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,839
these small things like end-of-life

945
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,839
softwares sorry

946
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,839
advanced persistent threats can easily

947
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,480
happen in future as well

948
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,480
now

949
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,440
some let's discuss some prevention and

950
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,839
mitigation strategies along along or

951
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,720
around eol softwares so how can we

952
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,800
prevent them how we how we can take care

953
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,040
of these eol softwares so the very

954
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,119
important thing is in order to detect

955
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,240
them on time patch upgrade or remove

956
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
them the very first thing which we can

957
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,480
do is improve our risk assessment plan

958
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,240
so in our risk assessment plan and

959
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,400
strategy we can include detection of

960
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,240
these eol software so that we can

961
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,280
calculate their risk rating for futual

962
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,800
for future possible threats and

963
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,440
vulnerabilities second is we can include

964
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,760
some advanced automation techniques in

965
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,920
endpoint detection softwares the

966
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,839
endpoint detection and response tools

967
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,839
which we are using like carbon black and

968
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,480
other like windows defenders what we can

969
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
do is we can include some detection

970
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,640
advanced detection mechanism through

971
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,960
which these tools can easily detect

972
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,520
end-of-life softwares in our systems

973
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,560
applications and services so that once

974
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,200
they are detected and alerted we can

975
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,839
patch or upgrade them on time next is

976
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,760
inventory management so of course we

977
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,079
know inventory management is one of the

978
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,319
major methodologies which is used in

979
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,720
large organization in order to manage

980
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,119
their assets so in inventory management

981
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,240
tool also we can include eol detection

982
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,000
we can include these strategies for

983
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,800
end-of-life surface detection on time so

984
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,880
that again they are detected at a very

985
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,440
initial stage of asset discovery and we

986
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,839
can remove either we can remove them or

987
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,520
we can upgrade them so if there is a

988
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,440
possible upgrade for these end-of-life

989
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,400
softwares we can easily upgrade them but

990
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,599
if there is no upgrade the best rule is

991
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,920
to replace them on time even though it

992
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,640
will require a small investment of money

993
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,040
trust me trust me it's better than the

994
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,599
big impact you can get from a security

995
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,560
incident from major cyber threat

996
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,280
now fourth important thing which we are

997
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,520
seeing which i am seeing currently is

998
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,319
there is an organization known as free

999
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,560
software foundation they are coming up

1000
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,800
with good really so this is a non-profit

1001
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,200
organization which is free software and

1002
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,040
what they are doing what this foundation

1003
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,280
is doing they are creating campaigns

1004
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,040
around end-of-life softwares and what

1005
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,319
kind of campaigns they have start

1006
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,359
recently we know in 2020 january's

1007
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,000
windows windows 7 became end-of-life

1008
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,599
software so they have started this

1009
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,720
initiative where they are requesting to

1010
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,319
change like they are requesting

1011
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,880
microsoft to change windows 7 from end

1012
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,040
of life to a free software once it

1013
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,359
becomes a free or open source software

1014
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,920
we can easily patch them and upgrade

1015
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,319
them throughout the life cycle and they

1016
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,240
become easy to manage so one of the

1017
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,000
mitigation strategy or prevention

1018
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,319
strategy is to make these end-of-life

1019
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,440
softwares as free software's so that

1020
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,000
their their upgrade their patching their

1021
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,240
upgrade their functionality can be

1022
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,520
enhanced throughout life

1023
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,599
now next important thing is when we are

1024
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,240
implementing these mitigation strategies

1025
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,640
and prevention techniques why not

1026
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
implement them with one of the good

1027
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,920
possible business methodology pdca which

1028
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,359
is plan do check act is one of the

1029
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,280
business methodology used in the

1030
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,599
enormous normal business operations like

1031
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,520
id operations account operation

1032
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,359
financial operations so it is a very

1033
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,520
good with business methodology skill or

1034
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,760
technique which is used by a lot of

1035
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,400
organizations it's proactive it's a

1036
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,599
continuous learning program so pdca

1037
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,000
through pdca we are continually learning

1038
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,400
and improving so of course when i say we

1039
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,640
have to implement some prevention and

1040
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,599
mitigation strategy of course we know in

1041
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,480
future when new kind of eos office will

1042
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,800
come we would have to include we will

1043
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,720
have to include more prevention and

1044
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,839
mitigation strategies so when we know we

1045
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,480
have to improve from time to time why

1046
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,319
not implement these mitigation and

1047
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,960
prevention strategies with the continual

1048
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,839
learning program so in pdca for example

1049
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,240
how we can implement pdca in mitigation

1050
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,160
and prevention strategies of eol

1051
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,680
software is in your plan stage so pdca

1052
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,920
the p in the pdca is the plan so in the

1053
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,160
plan stage what you can do is include

1054
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,119
eol software risk assessment as part of

1055
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,920
organizations risk assessment plan so if

1056
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,839
eol

1057
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,280
software's and their detection their

1058
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,839
detection their mitigation is part of

1059
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,240
your risk assessment plan you can easily

1060
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,800
assess them at your risk assessment like

1061
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,040
during risk assessment you can assess

1062
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,720
their risk ratings

1063
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,960
in the do part what you can do is when

1064
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,000
we have completed the risk assessment we

1065
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,720
we can't decide on the necessary steps

1066
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,960
we we have to take for these end-of-life

1067
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,680
softwares when we know the necessary

1068
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,920
steps we can take so we'll implement

1069
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,920
those strategies either upgradation or

1070
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,480
replacement once we do that we do a

1071
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,200
check check is always done to verify

1072
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,280
what actions we have performed on our

1073
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,599
planning and do techniques is it right

1074
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,280
or not do we need to make any

1075
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,960
enhancement on further changes or

1076
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,599
validations and repeat means we repeat

1077
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,880
this process and in this process of pdca

1078
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,920
each time each time when a particular

1079
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,400
implementation is done we learn from

1080
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,640
time to time so for example certain

1081
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,560
technique was not for example a certain

1082
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,280
strategy for eol software mitigation and

1083
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,760
prevention was not included earlier now

1084
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,520
we have encountered a situation through

1085
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,319
one of the new el software what we can

1086
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,400
do is we can include that new technique

1087
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,000
in our pdc8

1088
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,480
methodology and improve from time to

1089
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,560
time

1090
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,599
next along with pdca is

1091
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,920
swot analysis

1092
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,359
now what happened in case of swot

1093
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,079
analysis swot analysis again is an

1094
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,480
important implementation strategy it's a

1095
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,040
powerful technique which reflects not

1096
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,200
only the strengths and opportunity to an

1097
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,160
organization but or it also requires it

1098
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,560
also reflects boldly about the

1099
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,960
weaknesses and threats so how we can

1100
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,119
utilize swot analysis for prevention and

1101
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,240
mitigation of eos softwares so now when

1102
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,000
the organization knows what are the

1103
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,920
strength for example if an organization

1104
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,920
is implementing swot analysis from the

1105
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,599
security point of view or security

1106
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,920
structure point of view first of all for

1107
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,960
what are the strength of the

1108
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,400
organization what are the what are the

1109
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,800
good security controls implementations

1110
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,040
tools application in place what are the

1111
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,880
future opportunities for the

1112
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,200
organization like are we are we going to

1113
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,760
install some new tools uh from security

1114
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,839
point of view hire more professionals

1115
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,400
and when coming to weakness we can find

1116
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,000
out along with the normal

1117
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,839
vulnerabilities in our application

1118
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,319
system and services we can find out

1119
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,160
vulnerabilities through end-of-life

1120
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,720
softwares and we can then associate

1121
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,119
those vulnerabilities with future risk

1122
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,920
and threats and based on that we will

1123
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,160
not be like based on these swot analysis

1124
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,760
we will not be just focusing on the

1125
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,119
strength and opportunity of an

1126
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,280
organization we'll be focusing on the

1127
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,520
weaknesses and threats as well and when

1128
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,520
we will focus on the weaknesses and

1129
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,800
threats we will be able to view them and

1130
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,680
not ignore them so swot analysis

1131
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,880
actually make you boldly see the

1132
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,559
actually real structure of your

1133
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,800
organization so if you're trying to

1134
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,960
ignore if you're trying to run away from

1135
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,280
the weaknesses and threats they'll make

1136
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,440
you feel like no you have to face it you

1137
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,000
have to work on it now what additional

1138
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,640
swot analysis can help and pdca can help

1139
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,280
us is for example we reach a situation

1140
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,040
where we detected some end-of-life

1141
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,440
softwares and we are now thinking what

1142
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,040
to do with them

1143
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,440
either to upgrade them or invest some

1144
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,160
money get some new softwares in place so

1145
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,160
what is the best strategy for our

1146
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,480
organization will all depend on our

1147
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,880
business environment whatever is the

1148
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,119
business requirement according to that

1149
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,240
we'll take necessary decision and pdca

1150
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,319
and swot analysis like

1151
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,800
techniques better than them i cannot see

1152
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,960
that right now like swot is like

1153
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,079
proactive pdca is continuous learning

1154
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,559
and through them looking at the picture

1155
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,160
of the current situation of your

1156
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,520
organization you can take good actions

1157
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,440
you can take better mitigation and

1158
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,839
prevention strategies for the eol

1159
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,400
softwares

1160
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,000
now

1161
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,720
we very well know your applications are

1162
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,040
as good as your softwares your

1163
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,040
applications your services they are

1164
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,640
doing their best they are giving their

1165
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,079
best until and unless they are updated

1166
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,960
if they are not updated dude you are

1167
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,960
under threat you are under risk you are

1168
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,200
under vulnerabilities that's why it's

1169
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,480
important for organizations to upgrade

1170
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,240
to up to patch upgrade replace end of

1171
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,599
life and uh uh other outdated softwares

1172
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,960
and once you do that it be like you are

1173
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,400
taking one step ahead actually of the

1174
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,200
attacker because once you protect and

1175
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,520
you implement all security control this

1176
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,520
is a very important statement even

1177
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,000
though your organization is investing

1178
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
good amount of money in cyber security

1179
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,599
hiring professionals implementing

1180
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,839
security tools but when your

1181
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,400
organization is not patching software's

1182
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,920
application and services which are

1183
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,079
required they are under risk they are

1184
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,760
under vulnerability and they are under

1185
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,480
threat so that's why always remember

1186
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,200
upgrading patching and replacing

1187
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,200
according to your business requirement

1188
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,200
and here is a list of upcoming eol dates

1189
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,359
