00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,640
here to help

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,920
hello my name is anita d'amico and i am

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,640
the ceo of code dx

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,880
now most of my time these days is spent

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,760
as an executive of an appsec company

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,760
but my background is actually as an

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,000
experimental psychologist

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,880
and for most of my career i've studied

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,120
how to improve human performance

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,280
including technologies to improve

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,440
improve human performance

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,239
and so for the last 10 years i've been

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,039
looking at application security and ways

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,039
to improve the performance of appsec

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,600
analysts and to help software developers

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,239
develop more secure code

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,559
so it wasn't surprising to me when about

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,960
two years ago somebody came up to me and

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,720
said can you join a panel on diversity

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,680
we'd like to discuss diversity and apsec

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,600
and we specifically like you to talk

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,479
about

31
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,119
how can diversity

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,759
improve the performance of application

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,960
security analysts or software developers

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,759
so i thought about that and i said

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,920
you know i don't actually know if

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,479
diversity makes a difference i hope it

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,600
does but i actually don't know about

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,400
what scientific studies have been done

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,920
that look at how diversity affects

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,159
secure software development software

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
development in general cyber security or

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,159
even just team performance

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,720
so i decided to do a quick literature

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,479
review of this

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,600
and some of the things that i uncovered

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,680
i am going to present today

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,520
so today's session

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
is an attempt to answer the question

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,719
does diversity have an impact on

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,240
software and security teams

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,479
so first of all

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,199
a lot of people want diversity people

53
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,038
talk about diversity

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,000
in a very positive way in general they

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,599
say we need more diversity in the

56
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,080
workplace that a more diverse team is

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,040
likely to develop a better product they

58
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,040
talk about diversity is essential for

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,840
the success of a business

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
and so

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,959
people want to believe and i certainly

62
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,800
want to believe that diversity has a

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,400
positive impact on a team or a company

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,720
but what is it that people actually

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,160
expect from diversity when they say it's

66
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,599
it's good for the company or good for

67
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,599
the team well one of the things that

68
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,080
people expect is that there's going to

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,440
be more innovation and creativity from a

70
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,879
diverse team

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,200
they also think especially in security

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,879
that you're going to have an expanded

73
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,120
set of solutions or different ways of

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,640
looking at a problem

75
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,319
it might yield better quality or

76
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,519
security

77
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,440
some companies think that diversity is

78
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,080
going to improve their bottom line

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,040
and certainly people are interested in

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,519
diversity improving the rest of the

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,920
team's cultural insights and in

82
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,400
improving employee engagement

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,959
so that's what people hope diversity

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,159
will do

85
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,120
but

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
what does it actually do

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
well before we answer that question we

88
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,400
have to look at what is diversity

89
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,560
now most of the time

90
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,120
when people talk about diversity they're

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,159
talking about surface or demographic

92
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,400
differences between people these are

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,440
things that are immediately visible

94
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,239
like

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,080
uh age or gender or race or physical

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,120
ability

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,440
but there's other types of diversity

98
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,840
there's cognitive diversity

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,599
these are different ways that people

100
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,760
approach solving a problem or thinking

101
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,120
about a problem

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,680
there's personality diversity we've all

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,519
worked with introverts and extroverts

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,640
and people with different personality uh

105
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,799
types and in our teams

106
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,799
there's neural diversity

107
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,680
there are people who vary along the

108
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,519
autism spectrum

109
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,280
and who approach a problem differently

110
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,478
based on

111
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,639
their neurophysiology

112
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,639
there's knowledge diversity

113
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,720
that is the different types of expertise

114
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
or knowledge that people bring into a

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,919
team

116
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,080
and then finally there's personal value

117
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,280
diversity people come to a team with

118
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,160
their own set of morals and beliefs and

119
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,880
values which can be very different from

120
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,919
each other

121
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,759
so those are just some of the types of

122
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,040
diversity

123
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,160
and today i'm going to focus on three

124
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,560
types surface diversity knowledge

125
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,600
diversity and personal value diversity

126
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
and i'm going to talk a little bit about

127
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,919
the impact of these types of diversity

128
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,800
on team performance

129
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,600
so let's talk about surface diversity

130
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
this is the type of diversity that is

131
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,960
easily visible it may be age

132
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,479
race gender physical ability so do you

133
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,400
think it makes a difference on team

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
performance

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,520
well in fact

136
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,160
there are mixed results sometimes it's

137
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,039
beneficial and sometimes it's not

138
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,759
so let's take a look at one area and

139
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,840
that's

140
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,800
innovation

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
uh there's a there are people that

142
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,680
studied the

143
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
impact of diversity

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,400
on the newly formed teams and they

145
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,960
looked at the quality and the quantity

146
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,800
of innovative ideas that came out of

147
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,840
that team and what they found was that

148
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,280
when you add

149
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,240
race

150
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,520
age or gender diversity it actually had

151
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,479
no impact on the quality of innovative

152
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,000
ideas

153
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,800
but there were differences on the number

154
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,880
of innovative ideas

155
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,680
and in interesting ways if you add in

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,160
racial diversity you actually increase

157
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,880
the number of innovative ideas

158
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,440
but when you add gender diversity there

159
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,960
are actually fewer innovative ideas

160
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,560
and that got people to thinking about

161
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,639
well why is that

162
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,000
and one of the

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,039
theories about this is that when you

164
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,840
introduce let's say

165
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,440
women to a mostly male environment

166
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,160
they will feel a little bit threatened

167
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,039
and may not actually speak up they're

168
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
afraid of either being criticized or or

169
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
or being uninformed and so they don't

170
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,039
actually add to the discussion

171
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,560
we're going to talk more about that

172
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,000
later

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,520
but there's other

174
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,680
work that's been done on innovation and

175
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,360
that's looking at it at the company

176
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,840
level and when you look at innovation at

177
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,360
the company level

178
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,919
the more gender and racial diversity

179
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,039
that a company has the more innovative

180
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,479
they are

181
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,479
on the other hand when you add in age

182
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,800
and ethnic diversity it really has

183
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,039
little or no impact at the company level

184
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,360
so now let's talk about knowledge

185
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,880
diversity

186
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,000
knowledge diversity are the variations

187
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,160
in the types and the depth of knowledge

188
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,639
training and education that people bring

189
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,599
into a team

190
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,080
and what has been found is that

191
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,800
knowledge diversity is highly beneficial

192
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,319
to software and security teams

193
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,759
in fact

194
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,280
if you increase knowledge diversity

195
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,360
then the software that is produced by

196
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
that team

197
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,680
is

198
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,280
better technically

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,919
it's more aligned with user requirements

200
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,160
and it's more easily adapted to changing

201
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,639
requirements

202
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,919
now

203
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,919
there's something at play here i'm going

204
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,319
to talk about that it's called team

205
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,680
cognition

206
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,960
that knowledge diversity increases team

207
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
cognition

208
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,039
so let's talk about team cognition

209
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,759
team cognition are the mental models

210
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
that each team member

211
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,840
bring into the environment

212
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,720
and when they share those mental models

213
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,199
it helps them in coordinating their work

214
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,360
with each other and what you want to get

215
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,879
to is a shared mental model across the

216
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,879
entire team

217
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,960
so there are certain things

218
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,160
that help team cognition one of those

219
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,960
is transferring knowledge it doesn't do

220
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,919
a team

221
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,958
much good if people just sit back and

222
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,839
keep their own information to themselves

223
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,240
you actually have to transfer the

224
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,360
knowledge to each other in order to

225
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,279
achieve a shared mental model

226
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,519
and one of the ways to do that is the

227
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,200
first thing is that you have to tell

228
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
people this person is expert at this

229
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,279
this person's expert at that so that

230
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,240
they know who the go-to person is

231
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,399
but there's other things that you can do

232
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,200
to foster this team cognition

233
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,279
one is gender diversity

234
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,440
the studies have shown that when you

235
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,640
have

236
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,760
a more mixed gender team there is more

237
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,240
of a transfer of knowledge across the

238
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,640
team members

239
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,160
now there's some things to avoid

240
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,959
and one thing to avoid is specialized

241
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,080
jargon

242
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
that when you have a team that's

243
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,399
comprised of let's say experts in three

244
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,120
different domains each domain has its

245
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
own specialized jargon

246
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,800
and if you continue to speak in your

247
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
specialized jargon

248
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,600
it impedes the transfer of knowledge so

249
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,000
you have to think about how you're going

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,800
to

251
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,440
talk about your expertise in a way that

252
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,880
doesn't use the jargon of your expertise

253
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,839
and if you reduce it to more of a common

254
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,040
vernacular

255
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,120
then you're going to have

256
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,360
more sharing of knowledge and greater

257
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,600
team cognition

258
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,120
now there's also other things that you

259
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,959
can do to

260
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,800
improve team cognition

261
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,760
and that is more face-to-face meetings

262
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,560
and more phone conversations

263
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,399
but email

264
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,079
doesn't really make any difference in

265
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,320
team cognition emails

266
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,399
is one of those things where you throw

267
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,160
something over the fence to somebody you

268
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,079
say here read this

269
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,720
and there's no exchange back and forth

270
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,320
whereas when you have face-to-face

271
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,800
meetings or you have phone calls or

272
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,959
video conferences there's a give and

273
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,200
take there's a back and forth

274
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,360
and that is what helps the transfer of

275
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,440
knowledge and what helps to create the

276
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,399
shared mental model

277
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,079
now there's other things at play

278
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,480
in when you create a team that has

279
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,040
knowledge diversity you are creating

280
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,240
different perspectives on the same

281
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,360
issue

282
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,720
and when you have those different

283
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,160
perspectives

284
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,640
what happens is that there are a lot of

285
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,600
small task-related conflicts that occur

286
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
or tensions in the group in fact there's

287
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
a name for it it's called constructive

288
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,839
conflicts or cognitive conflicts

289
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,200
and what happens is when people

290
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,279
present those conflicts and they debate

291
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,800
them they debate their goals their

292
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,279
procedures their courses of action they

293
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,760
start to come to a resolution of the

294
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,240
conflict and when they do

295
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,160
they get better solutions

296
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,880
now what this does

297
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,560
is it avoids group think

298
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,880
group think is that condition under

299
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,279
which alternative explanations or

300
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,680
solutions are just not assessed it's

301
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,320
like having your blinders on that's what

302
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,920
group think is you're not thinking out

303
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,680
of the box but when you have knowledge

304
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,959
diversity

305
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,920
then you can entertain other viewpoints

306
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,519
and the last thing that knowledge

307
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,760
diversity does is it gives you an

308
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,160
opportunity to be more flexible in

309
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,720
matching skills to tasks because you

310
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,680
have more skills available to you so it

311
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,599
adds to the efficiency of the team

312
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,680
now the last type of diversity we're

313
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,880
going to talk about is value diversity

314
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,519
value diversity are the differences in

315
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,800
personal values that people bring into a

316
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,519
group they might be their morals

317
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,839
their deep cultural differences

318
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,240
religious or political beliefs

319
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,880
and they are not something that's easily

320
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,079
visible when you first meet somebody but

321
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,320
it's something that you learn about

322
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,519
somebody as you work with them

323
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,839
now when you study this in the

324
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,240
scientific literature they they have

325
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,560
certain words that they use to describe

326
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,600
some of these beliefs or values and so

327
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,320
here's just a sample of them

328
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,480
so a value would be

329
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,680
uh people who are motivated or identify

330
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,720
with let's say power or prestige

331
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,560
you know we've all met people who are

332
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,959
trying to grab the glory and those who

333
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,200
are not at all motivated by that

334
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
there's cultural tradition

335
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,760
there's benevolence so some people want

336
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,200
to do things that are for the good of

337
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,160
everybody and others are hedonists and

338
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,959
they really want the quick win and

339
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,480
what's good for them

340
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
they're there are the conformists and

341
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,560
then there are those people who want to

342
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,079
do something different just for the sake

343
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,440
of being different

344
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,760
and there are those who value security

345
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,160
and safety and those who are risk takers

346
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,639
so these are just some of the types of

347
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,200
values we're talking about

348
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,079
so how does that affect team performance

349
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,399
well it turns out that it's actually not

350
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,839
very good for team performance

351
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,399
what value diversity does

352
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,279
is it creates value conflicts and

353
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,560
tensions in the group and unlike those

354
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,760
knowledge

355
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,360
tensions those knowledge conflicts the

356
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,440
the value conflicts are something that

357
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
are deeply entrenched you're not going

358
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,480
to change somebody's mind about about

359
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,199
something that is a deeply held belief

360
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,639
in an hour or a day or even a week and

361
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,760
so what happens is that those conflicts

362
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,240
impede the ability to work productively

363
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,880
and so when you look at software

364
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,240
production

365
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,639
uh and you have a highly diverse team

366
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,519
with respect to values what we find is

367
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,480
that it actually affects the

368
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,079
quality of the software that they

369
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,199
produce

370
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,320
so software performance is not as

371
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,760
efficient when it is produced by a team

372
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,560
that has a lot of value diversity versus

373
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,800
a homogeneous team

374
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,519
similarly software that is

375
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,199
developed by a highly diverse value team

376
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,040
is less adaptable to changing

377
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,639
requirements

378
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,120
so that's just something to keep in mind

379
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,160
as you

380
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,279
start working with a team that may have

381
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,399
a lot of diversity of values

382
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,480
so let's talk about that

383
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,519
let's talk about managing

384
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,399
the composition of a diverse team so

385
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,079
suppose you want to add diversity to

386
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,240
your department your team or your

387
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,480
company is is saying we really need to

388
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,880
add diversity what are the things that

389
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,839
you need to think about

390
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,560
well first of all

391
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
it's not all sunshine and rainbows

392
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,480
there are things you need to consider

393
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,360
so

394
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,759
as a software development team one of

395
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,399
the things that you must keep in mind

396
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,800
is that you shouldn't keep on adding

397
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,120
people to the software development team

398
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,839
and explode the size of the team just

399
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,880
for the sake of diversity

400
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,079
there is research out there on the human

401
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,560
factors that affect secure software

402
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,880
development that show

403
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,759
that

404
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,480
the bigger the team size the more likely

405
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,800
there are to be security flaws in the

406
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,560
software that they produce

407
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,519
and the research goes on to show that

408
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,839
there's a number roughly of about nine

409
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,320
developers that if you exceed that

410
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
you're going to have a lot more security

411
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,040
issues in the code so if you are adding

412
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,440
diversity to your team you're adding

413
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,680
people for the sake of diversity make

414
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,240
sure you don't increase the size to the

415
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,880
point that the entire team is producing

416
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,000
less secure software

417
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,199
now if you're adding surface diversity

418
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,839
if let's say you want to mix up the ages

419
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,519
or the genders or the race or the

420
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,480
ethnicity or the physical abilities of

421
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,920
uh your

422
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,360
of your team

423
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,720
there are certain things that you need

424
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
to keep in mind

425
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,839
one thing is that people feel

426
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,279
if they're in the minority they feel

427
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,040
that there's less consideration given to

428
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,240
their ideas

429
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,440
so you need to be an active listener

430
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,920
there's also something else that happens

431
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,359
if your goal

432
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,280
is to have a lot of interpersonal

433
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,400
engagement among your team members

434
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,480
you have to be aware of something called

435
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,079
fault lines as in tectonic fault lines

436
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,319
that when you push together a bunch of

437
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,839
people who come from diverse subgroups

438
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,160
they may work together well

439
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,959
but they self-organize into homogeneous

440
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,039
subgroups as soon as they

441
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,880
break for lunch

442
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,760
and so if you want this group to work

443
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,280
cohesively

444
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,600
it you know at break as well as during

445
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,880
work then you need to manage that in

446
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,000
such a way

447
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
that uh people just don't

448
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,559
break up into their little subgroups

449
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,440
now the good thing is that those fault

450
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,480
lines do fade over time eventually

451
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,880
people will just get used to each other

452
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,280
and they won't necessarily self self

453
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,720
organize into these subgroups

454
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,520
but there's something different at play

455
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,559
with value diversity

456
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,360
with value diversity the fault lines are

457
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,240
there

458
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,600
people who have share common values will

459
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,320
will gather together into their own uh

460
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,520
groups

461
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,919
and when they and those groups share

462
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,960
common morals cultural politics

463
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,000
and

464
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,200
it makes it difficult for them to work

465
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
with other people

466
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,559
it actually those fault lines stay there

467
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,600
and they do not easily fade over time

468
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,039
and what happens is some kind of

469
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,480
intransigence sets in

470
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,120
so there is a type of diversity that

471
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,840
really does make a difference

472
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,919
and that is knowledge diversity if

473
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,679
you're going to put together a diverse

474
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,720
team

475
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,799
first look for knowledge diversity and

476
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,960
if you look for knowledge diversity some

477
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,200
of those other uh diversities for

478
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,240
example surface diversity may uh come

479
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,720
along with that but if you try to put

480
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,000
together a team that has knowledge

481
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,160
diversity you're almost assuredly going

482
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,039
to have a winning team

483
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,120
now there's one more thing i want to

484
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,160
talk about

485
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,960
and that's psychological safety

486
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,200
i've mentioned this before that minority

487
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,360
members of a team may fear that their

488
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,960
suggestions will be ignored or

489
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,000
criticized this is a known phenomenon

490
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,320
it's repeated over and over again in the

491
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,200
scientific literature so you need to

492
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,760
actively listen and establish an

493
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,720
environment of psychological safety so

494
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,360
people feel it's okay to voice their

495
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,400
opinion or to or to voice an exception

496
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,559
to something that you said

497
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,280
and the studies show that with respect

498
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,520
to software engineering

499
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,400
psychological safety is more important

500
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,640
for the success of a software

501
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,120
engineering team than the team structure

502
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,200
itself

503
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,480
so think about that as you diversify

504
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,760
your team

505
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,159
and ensure that all members views are

506
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,240
encouraged and recognized and that

507
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,720
people feel safe in their environment

508
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,840
i hope you enjoyed this session on

509
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,120
diversity

510
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,360
if you'd like to learn more feel free to
