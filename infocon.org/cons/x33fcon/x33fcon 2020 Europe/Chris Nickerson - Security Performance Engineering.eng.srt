1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,280
um

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,040
i'll start with every kind of just basic

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,160
engineering disclosure especially in

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,560
security

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,760
i have compensating controls my first

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,759
compensating control

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,519
is that i don't know whether to drink

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,519
wine or coffee because

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,359
of where i'm presenting from or where

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,759
i'm presenting in

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,320
so maybe i'll do a combination of both

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,480
um if my presentation is terrible

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,160
blame it on the wine if my presentation

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,319
is good blame it on the coffee

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,760
otherwise we'll just continue on from

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,399
there um

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,360
so i wanted to talk a little bit today

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,920
about

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,960
a concept that at least has been sort of

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,200
new to me

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,000
uh which is really security performance

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,559
engineering

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,840
um i i've looked at security for a

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,160
really really long time

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,440
i've been an attacker and a pen tester

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,879
and all these different

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,480
pieces of the trade and as i've started

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,479
to get more familiar with the devops

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,039
world as i started to get more familiar

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,039
with

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,640
with large-scale development pipelines

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,479
and companies who are trying to operate

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,040
at scale and at speed

34
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,400
i've realized that a lot of the things

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,680
that i've been doing in security are

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,560
really really wrong

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,159
um but you know first to kind of foray

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,360
into that you know i

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,240
i'm chris um nice to meet you those are

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,640
my dogs

41
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,798
i have a wife and those are our two

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,799
little babies

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,960
we live up in the mountains i really

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,159
like snow it just recently snowed here

45
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,839
which makes it really nice i've kind of

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,880
come from a bunch of different areas of

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
industry

48
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,640
i started off at a large international

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
law firm

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,600
we weren't necessarily protecting the

51
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,119
good guys i won't say we weren't

52
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,039
protecting the bad guys either

53
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,520
but we're defending the tobacco

54
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,520
companies which you can only imagine

55
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,798
makes for some pretty interesting attack

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,119
scenarios especially in the early 90s

57
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,119
when people were gaining access to

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,759
information not only just

59
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,200
from physical means but electronic means

60
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,880
as people are starting to connect to the

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,640
internet things like that

62
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,799
some of the work that i did there led me

63
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,040
over to working at sprint

64
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,400
uh deploying one of the largest 3g

65
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,640
deployments in the world

66
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,959
uh funny story super not funny story

67
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,359
for anybody who remembers sequel slammer

68
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,800
um i i remember sql slammer and the

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,200
first day that it hit

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,160
because on our cell network we started

71
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,480
to see

72
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,480
these bills for customers in the

73
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,560
hundreds of thousands of dollars and we

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,119
hadn't even turned their service on yet

75
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,480
and what had happened was various

76
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,120
different pieces of slammers started

77
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,799
kind of propagating themselves over 3g

78
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,519
networks right as we were starting to

79
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,800
deploy them

80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,720
so we got um oh yeah today it's called

81
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,920
threat intelligence but at the time

82
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,080
it was just pissed customers um anyway

83
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,079
uh you know being able to move from

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,120
large scale carrier networks and kind of

85
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,319
innovating there

86
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,360
um i i took a stint at kpmg to try and

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,679
understand

88
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,040
you know not only how do does a legal

89
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,920
system work and how to carry your

90
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,599
networks work

91
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,920
but really what does security look like

92
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,359
from an audit standpoint

93
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,799
from you know all the people who are out

94
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,480
there checking the boxes trying to make

95
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,519
sure somebody's staying secure and stuff

96
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,079
like that

97
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,760
what i quickly found out is i was much

98
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,200
more of an engineer

99
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,239
than i was somebody who could wear a

100
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,440
button down as you could see

101
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,200
so the ability to tick and tie and carry

102
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,640
around seven different colors of pencils

103
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,958
and pens in order to

104
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,640
show a tick mark legend of whether a

105
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,080
compensating controller or regular

106
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,399
control was valid

107
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,440
in order to surface the the condensing

108
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
control that

109
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,319
existed inside of the requirement was

110
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,599
something that i really simply looked at

111
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,040
and i was like oh

112
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,640
well if you're trying to assess their

113
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,120
passwords why don't i just

114
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,480
own all their boxes and then i'll figure

115
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,959
out if i can crack their passwords or

116
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,959
not

117
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,239
and it'll be way faster than asking all

118
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,120
these people questions

119
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,400
um we didn't necessarily get along uh

120
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,519
but i did learn a lot

121
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,480
along the way uh so i transitioned from

122
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,480
kpmg

123
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,798
out to a company called alternative

124
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,920
technology which became aero electronics

125
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,840
big 12 billion dollar distributor uh and

126
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,199
and while they sold firewalls and all

127
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,160
these different products and all this

128
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,320
other stuff

129
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,800
um what i was in charge of was was

130
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,120
selling services so everything from

131
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,960
deployment services of the hardware that

132
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,759
we sold the security

133
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,960
the software um it was kind of around

134
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,199
the time that they made the really

135
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,560
crappy tv show about us breaking into

136
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,880
stuff

137
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,560
which i won't go into unless you really

138
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,240
want to ask questions about that but it

139
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,440
was terrible

140
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,040
so don't watch it uh but but nonetheless

141
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,120
you know we were we're talking more

142
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,919
about this kind of idea of active red

143
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,240
teaming

144
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,000
the ability to go kind of full scope on

145
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,120
people and really start to bring the

146
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,440
security space

147
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,440
into what we considered kind of common

148
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,680
adversarial testing

149
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,880
that led us 12 years ago to starting

150
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,000
lara's

151
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,639
lars is really focused on the idea

152
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,039
that we were going to be any level of

153
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,039
adversary that someone could suggest

154
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,479
so whether it was a nation state

155
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,159
adversary whether it was

156
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,159
you know the generic script kitty which

157
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,880
is usually kind of like my job because i

158
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,280
suck

159
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,639
um but or if it was you know the

160
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,198
innovator who was bringing

161
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,720
zero days and new research to the market

162
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,400
um what our job we

163
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,000
wanted to do is really be the sparring

164
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,679
partner and coach for people

165
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,199
so that's really what what we found the

166
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,600
company on um

167
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,639
obviously we do things you know like pen

168
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
testing

169
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,560
um which which i think everybody

170
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,759
probably has a connection to

171
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,680
um we we do things like appsec

172
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,440
uh when we're looking through code and

173
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
trying to get an understanding

174
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,360
both from all the different color of

175
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,840
boxes whether it's sas test whether

176
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,600
we're

177
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,758
you know trying to rip apart some new

178
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,240
piece of hardware um or whether we're

179
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,880
just looking at the source itself

180
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,600
uh we do things like social engineering

181
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,000
um

182
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,919
granted not always the greatest at it

183
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,639
but at the same time

184
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,400
um you know being able to use that as

185
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,639
one of the facilities to get in

186
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,080
is one of the metrics of the program um

187
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,240
not only do we have to

188
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,120
deal with defenses on the electronic

189
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,479
stand front

190
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,000
but we also have to do it on the

191
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,639
physical we also have to do with the

192
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,479
people

193
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,400
so we try and take that holistic kind of

194
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,719
approach

195
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,758
as a requirement we do risk assessment

196
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,840
here and there

197
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,639
uh whether it's iso standards whether

198
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,080
it's gdpr where it's bdsg

199
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,319
we have a number of international

200
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,080
standards that we support and all of you

201
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,080
who have gone through the hell of trying

202
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,639
to maintain compliance standards

203
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,680
i'm i'm sure we could have either let's

204
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,560
see

205
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,000
a coffee or wine to determine whether we

206
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,800
get along or not

207
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,560
uh and then you know finally we we do a

208
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,280
little bit of incident response here and

209
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,440
there

210
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,318
obviously being testers and getting an

211
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,319
understanding

212
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,479
of what you can do when you're getting

213
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,360
into an environment where that goes how

214
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,880
it gets there

215
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,360
and then what the impact of the

216
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,280
environment is leads us to have a fairly

217
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,440
good team of incident responders whether

218
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,758
it's reversing malware being able to

219
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,919
you know adhere and kind of respond to

220
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,440
the situations

221
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,359
i think one of the fairly unique things

222
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,680
about our business is that we also try

223
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,240
and take into account physical security

224
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,319
um you know here you can see an

225
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,120
appropriately guarded physical security

226
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,479
system

227
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,720
uh this yes was actually from a client

228
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,318
site no i won't release the name

229
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,840
but it's somebody that everybody

230
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,120
probably knows that's a global

231
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,080
organization

232
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,000
um nonetheless uh not only do we do

233
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,758
physical walkthroughs being able to help

234
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,919
people with camera placements through

235
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,199
blueprints getting an understanding of

236
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,280
wall thickness

237
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,879
uh you know everything from explosion

238
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,318
resistance all the way down to the

239
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,960
ability to pick something

240
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,800
up but we also do full scope red teaming

241
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,719
that ends up being the thing where you

242
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,000
know you try and sneak into the building

243
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,000
and you get there and

244
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,759
you do all these cool little hacks and

245
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,599
you know defeat rfid

246
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,039
and you know clone somebody's badge and

247
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,280
end up in the rafters

248
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,800
and then you end up like this falling

249
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,559
through the rafters because you slipped

250
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,639
on a piece of electrical conduit

251
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,680
uh and your friends take pictures of you

252
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,639
because it's hilarious

253
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,479
this is actually a real shot from jobs

254
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,879
we've we've also gone through

255
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,680
and deleted some of the other pictures

256
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,639
that probably aren't great for everyone

257
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,199
but as you can imagine doing this type

258
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,879
of work

259
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,240
isn't always the most elegant thing in

260
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,159
the world

261
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,240
now when we think about overall security

262
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,599
we look at it from a lens of kind of

263
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,440
three different circles

264
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,360
we have the electronic lens we have the

265
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,000
physical lens the social lens

266
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,399
and every single little piece of that

267
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,560
has

268
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,440
a new attack surface that's associated

269
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,079
with it

270
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,959
um when when we first started out the

271
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,600
company and

272
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,160
i'll take this kind of 12 plus years ago

273
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,800
we were

274
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,000
really driving home the effort of we

275
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,760
need to be able to test

276
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,680
all of these things right we need to be

277
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,200
able to test electronic we need to fully

278
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,839
test physical we need to fully test

279
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,560
social

280
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,920
we have to be able to get a solid

281
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,279
understanding of really what our

282
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,680
resistance level is

283
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,360
so that we can try and resolve it and

284
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,920
the one thing that i figured out

285
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,959
uh and this is you know 12 plus years in

286
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,640
the making

287
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,518
is that i was totally wrong um

288
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,240
and i say that with all circumstance and

289
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,680
honesty

290
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,160
that i i really was not in the right

291
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,599
space when i was talking about all of

292
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,040
the different ways that we could test

293
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,040
everything

294
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,719
because some of the problems that we're

295
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,880
experiencing in the industry

296
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,240
really aren't just about testing they're

297
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,800
really not just about

298
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,760
identifying what is wrong or isn't wrong

299
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,240
it's not about

300
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,399
you know creating that glamour graphic

301
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,279
where everything's red and nothing's

302
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,519
green and

303
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,640
you know the sky is falling everything's

304
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,320
screwed and

305
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,000
people have to give you money in order

306
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,160
for it to all go away

307
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,040
um it's it's really about something

308
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,040
different right

309
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,959
it's it's really really about this

310
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,360
coaching and sparring aspect

311
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,359
you know we we don't want to work on

312
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,720
something that's not sustainable

313
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,880
um going in and taking an absolute

314
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,720
beating from a pen test from a physical

315
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,959
security test from a red team

316
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,000
from whatever you want to call it sc

317
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,760
blah blah blah

318
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
you know you can you can name all of

319
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,079
these different things that exist

320
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,920
inside the construct of security today

321
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,519
and most of them just aren't sustainable

322
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,000
it's not sustainable to just

323
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,839
beat a client into the submission you

324
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,680
know what we have to do

325
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,040
is understand where the deficiencies of

326
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,519
that come from so

327
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,199
over the last 12 years i've had a whole

328
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,279
lot of reflections of

329
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,640
why isn't this sustainable and really

330
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,240
why isn't it working

331
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,880
so you know a lot of the things that

332
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,480
i've come up with um are just personal

333
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,240
to me and it doesn't it could just mean

334
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,079
that i'm a terrible tester it could mean

335
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,440
that you know we're possibly on to

336
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,319
something or it could mean nothing at

337
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,440
all

338
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,600
but really to me when i look at these

339
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,240
problems the first thing that i see is

340
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,519
there's no

341
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,279
real metrics we we talk about metrics in

342
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,640
this nebulous fashion

343
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:12,000
where you know my my favorite example

344
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,199
is every security product that i've ever

345
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,959
seen

346
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,360
that has some pretty login interface

347
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,880
whether it's some elk stack whether it's

348
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,480
some you know

349
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,959
like beautiful little you know ui

350
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,800
that's all rubyed up or whatever else

351
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,000
that has all these pretty graphs

352
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,439
and the metrics aren't real they say i

353
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
have stopped

354
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,120
9 million bad things but it doesn't tell

355
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,839
you out of how many

356
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,560
is it 9 million out of 9 million is it 9

357
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,279
million

358
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,959
out of a trillion is it nine million out

359
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,240
of six and then you know that it's just

360
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,560
a big error

361
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,240
um so one of the biggest things that

362
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,800
i've found throughout all these years of

363
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,560
testing

364
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,920
is that our metrics don't tend to have

365
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,839
any foundations

366
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,120
so we need to create foundations for our

367
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,880
metrics

368
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,160
also when we're doing these types of

369
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,000
tests we're just beating up an

370
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,480
environment sure it's easy to beat them

371
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,040
up i mean it's easy to walk into

372
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,240
you know a primary school and beat up a

373
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,920
bunch of little kids

374
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,440
it doesn't mean that you're very tough

375
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,079
and it surely doesn't mean that you can

376
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,399
fight

377
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,000
but at the same time what we're doing is

378
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,200
we're just increasing this technical

379
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,120
debt we're going in

380
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,560
we're beating these people up we're

381
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,959
showing them these vulnerabilities we're

382
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
showing

383
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,000
hey we can get access to anything that

384
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,239
we want no matter how much

385
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,480
money you spend or what you do or how

386
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,560
you do it we can still get access

387
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,480
so what we're doing there is we're

388
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,599
actually increasing the amount of debt

389
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,440
that they're taking on

390
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,279
we're not actually resolving that debt

391
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,360
so we have to start to figure out

392
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,680
how do we resolve the debt that we're

393
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,560
creating by doing the test that we're

394
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,000
doing

395
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,479
right other pieces of it to me

396
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,079
is that not only do we not really look

397
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,880
anything like an attack because we're

398
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,719
using can

399
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,959
tools where you know people are writing

400
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,839
signatures for stuff like crack map or

401
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,959
metasploit

402
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,320
or you know throwback or cobalt strike

403
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,319
or whatever else

404
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,839
but but one of the things that that's

405
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,760
really important to me that i think

406
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,839
hasn't been captured over the years

407
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,360
is that oftentimes our results are

408
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,839
fracturing teams

409
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,480
we're not helping the team solidify

410
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,440
we're actually

411
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,839
creating polarization in the team right

412
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,399
we're

413
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,600
we're stopping people from being part of

414
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,880
the same team

415
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,760
when when i look at my job my job

416
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,200
is to try and improve a company's

417
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,600
security

418
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,880
the defense team is trying to improve a

419
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,079
company security

420
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,720
the cso the cio the cto

421
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,719
all of these people have charges maybe

422
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,399
it's not the same way maybe it's not the

423
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,199
same language but all of us at the end

424
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,360
of the day

425
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,319
have the same feeling that we really

426
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,440
want

427
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,199
to get our paycheck because if we don't

428
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,040
it probably means that the company got

429
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,279
owned and we're out of business

430
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,719
but not to be selfish we also want to

431
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,519
make sure that our customers are

432
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,560
protected

433
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,040
our products are secure i mean how many

434
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,839
people

435
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,920
in here are working with a product set

436
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,720
that could directly affect a human life

437
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,519
tomorrow

438
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,279
i mean that's a pretty big motivator in

439
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,800
order to try and get our jobs done

440
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,480
so we don't want to load up a bunch of

441
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,079
debt and fracture the team and make

442
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,600
people angry at each other

443
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,680
we want to be essential to the

444
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,360
organization we want to be the glue that

445
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,079
ties all of these different services

446
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,600
together

447
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,680
and the ways that we've done it in the

448
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,320
past don't seem to do that

449
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,359
so we've had to try and reimagine what

450
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,279
are we going to do

451
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,480
in order to try and be that positive

452
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,160
force of change

453
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,399
that we've always wanted to see but

454
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,920
never really understood how we're going

455
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,360
to do it

456
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,479
so we start off with you know magical

457
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,079
catch phrases right

458
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,000
defensive improvement through

459
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,399
adversarial simulation and

460
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,519
collaboration i am sure that that

461
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,839
translates

462
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,600
absolutely terribly it means nothing

463
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,519
which is probably what it means to the

464
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,440
rest of the security industry

465
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,600
but what we started to do is we started

466
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,839
to work with companies like mitre

467
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,720
and and we started to say okay let's

468
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,839
build a

469
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,279
common database let's not let's not

470
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,279
treat it like a bingo card or anything

471
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,360
else let's try and say

472
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,560
here is a single source here's a

473
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,199
thesaurus here's a

474
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,439
dictionary that exists of attacks and if

475
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,079
we could make that single dictionary

476
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,680
then both offense and defense could look

477
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,079
at that dictionary and both

478
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,479
work from the same language we could say

479
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,800
oh dll injection i didn't have to talk

480
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,839
about it across 20 operating systems or

481
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,240
all these different

482
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,720
functions or whatever else i could look

483
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,160
at a single ttp and i could say let's

484
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,160
together work on this

485
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,600
let's figure out what control is going

486
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,360
to hit it let's figure out where the

487
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,440
artifact is going to come from

488
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,440
let's see how well we do against it

489
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,240
let's get some actual measurement going

490
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,920
on

491
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,440
so what do we do we first do a defensive

492
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,360
controls inventory

493
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,880
right this is the biggest thing in

494
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,120
everyone's magic

495
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,800
i'm gonna get on the miter train attack

496
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,639
you know framework

497
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,240
horse um this is the biggest thing that

498
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,839
they miss this is the biggest thing

499
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,360
that stops the success of most

500
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,720
organizations is they don't do the

501
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,120
homework needed

502
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,000
in order for the attack taxonomy to even

503
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,560
work

504
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,519
first off what you have to do is be able

505
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,518
to take attack

506
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,720
and then take every single one of your

507
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,839
controls

508
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,240
and map them over attack so just like

509
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,279
i mean granted this is the worst excel

510
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,600
spreadsheet ever

511
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,439
i get that it just looks like a unicorn

512
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,680
puked on it

513
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,800
but what we want to try and do is we

514
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,279
want to look at

515
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,000
each one of these areas and we want to

516
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,199
think

517
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,519
where should i see the artifact if i'm

518
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,079
doing the injection if i'm doing proves

519
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,519
if i'm moving laterally you know if i'm

520
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,920
moving laterally can i see it on the

521
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,519
host

522
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,519
yeah sure i could see if somebody's

523
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,000
using winrm or wmi

524
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,000
or ps exec or whatever else but can i

525
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,920
also see it with my east-west traffic

526
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,279
tools could i see it on my router

527
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,360
switching environment

528
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,880
could i see it with other inline things

529
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,040
so we want to overlay

530
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,160
all the possibilities of where we can

531
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,000
see these artifacts

532
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,680
first right because then that's going to

533
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,240
give us a good idea of where to look and

534
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,240
how to look

535
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,480
then we want to try and score ourselves

536
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,679
so we go through the mechanisms

537
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,679
we score ourselves we get an

538
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,039
understanding of all right from

539
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,919
an offense perspective i can do this

540
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,720
from a protective and detective stance i

541
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,439
can do this

542
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,280
maybe i'm uh you know level four at

543
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,520
protecting against it because

544
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,480
clown strike or whatever else product

545
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,360
that i have in my

546
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,280
environment automatically blocks it but

547
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,479
maybe i don't really have the detection

548
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,240
capabilities because

549
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,600
it just automatically blocked it but it

550
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,200
didn't tell me that it blocked it

551
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,959
because i need to know that

552
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,720
right so we're going to start grading

553
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,640
each one of these different tactics

554
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,000
and get an understanding of what the

555
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,039
level of reliability

556
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,799
of the control is right now those of you

557
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,160
who have done performance engineering

558
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,080
are probably starting to go

559
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,600
oh yeah this is pretty simple stuff this

560
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,280
is how we manage servers

561
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,639
but people in security haven't really

562
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,879
figured this out yet

563
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,480
so we start to look at all right what's

564
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,120
the maturity of the breakdown

565
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,799
is it innovator controls is it novice

566
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,719
controls are these things that are done

567
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,440
by script kitties are they done by like

568
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,840
the apt ninja actors is it like

569
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,919
fancy pink flamingo is it something else

570
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,000
um you know what what are we really

571
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,960
doing inside of this

572
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,960
right so we can measure not only the

573
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,799
controls we can measure our coverage we

574
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,080
can measure the tactics we can measure

575
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,600
the way that they're detected

576
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,760
we can measure how long it takes to

577
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,000
detect them all of these things are

578
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,559
pertinent measurements to understand

579
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,799
how our program is performing so instead

580
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,080
of just yeah i blocked the bad thing or

581
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,760
no i didn't we want to

582
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,600
increase the amount of of reliability we

583
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,480
want to increase the definition of those

584
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,320
controls

585
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,480
and when we do that we start to realize

586
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,320
well this is cool it might work right we

587
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,679
might have a bunch of new findings

588
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,360
we might be able to give a bunch of

589
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,760
effectiveness data back

590
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,360
we might be able to make speed faster in

591
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,120
the environment we could

592
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,799
we could create you know social

593
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,320
awareness because we're doing these

594
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,879
things and people are either seeing that

595
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,120
we do

596
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,360
or don't catch them or we do or don't

597
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,280
detect them or we could automate them

598
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,120
right we have this whole backlog of

599
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,918
wonderful magical tickets that we could

600
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,080
work on

601
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,840
as well as things that were kudos to all

602
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,678
of the money that we spent in a security

603
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,678
program

604
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,000
the problem is is that it's just kind of

605
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,080
the surface right like we're just

606
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,240
looking at a single ttp we're not

607
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,199
really measuring the entirety of the

608
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,160
program

609
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,440
so we start to measure we go okay this

610
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,080
is what i measured i meant

611
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,600
measured a single tactic and we go

612
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,879
what's what's next

613
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,959
um so so to me i have to look a little

614
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,520
bit backwards at how are most programs

615
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,919
measured

616
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,760
right we measure our programs from

617
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,760
compliance we measure our

618
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,320
programs from you know how much budget

619
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,360
we have how many people that there are

620
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,159
we measure the program based on like how

621
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,959
good we are

622
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,280
in comparison to our peers which you

623
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,360
know

624
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,399
not not to get me started but but i

625
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,959
think that um

626
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,799
that's just such a funny question to ask

627
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,440
you know you ask a pen tester

628
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,360
um how do we rate against other people

629
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,000
that you do pen testing against

630
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,559
and you're like oh well you know i own

631
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,120
you

632
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,039
also and they're like yeah but is that

633
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,120
good or bad or like well i

634
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,720
didn't own you in the first two minutes

635
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,879
so i guess that's better

636
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,840
than somebody else that i owned in like

637
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,679
two minutes

638
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,879
but not as good as somebody that i owned

639
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,799
in an hour

640
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,559
but also it just took an hour to break

641
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,918
into a big company so i don't know if

642
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,000
that's good or bad

643
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,200
um you know i think i think we have to

644
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,880
kind of reframe

645
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,039
what is good and bad how do we measure

646
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,960
it what are the different scales of that

647
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,440
and not and not get into this you know

648
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,760
how are we doing against our peers

649
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,360
but really what are the trends and and

650
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,039
how are we going to look at

651
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,799
some of us measure ourselves by the pew

652
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,919
pew maps of like how many things are

653
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,320
coming at us

654
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,320
and some of us use the magic term risk

655
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,799
which i think is hilarious because

656
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,000
you know if it took the japanese 3 000

657
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,760
years

658
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,840
to make a word to relate to risk

659
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,840
you obviously know that's a fairly

660
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,600
complicated topic whereas everybody else

661
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,199
just sort of throws it around

662
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,199
um you know we don't really have a good

663
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,880
definition of risk everybody's

664
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,640
definition tends to be different

665
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,720
i mean surely you're not going to use

666
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,880
the cissp like

667
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,440
uh you know whatever the annual rate of

668
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,120
occurrence by the loss expectancy

669
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,720
um because what you're going to call the

670
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,239
hacker and be like hey how many times

671
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,679
are you planning on hacking me this year

672
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,880
and i'm going to throw that into my risk

673
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,280
formula

674
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,840
it's just it's not reasonable to to use

675
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,200
so we need to figure out another way to

676
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,080
measure ourselves

677
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,720
um so so in comes the idea of just

678
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,799
general security performance engineering

679
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,480
right we want to make sure that the

680
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,480
stuff we're spending money on

681
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,159
the tools that we have the people that

682
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,520
are in the environment the things that

683
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,400
we're doing the controls that we've

684
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,240
implemented

685
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,840
all of those things are working

686
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,600
effectively now

687
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,678
they could be wearing a very different

688
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,520
degree of effectiveness but all of them

689
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,360
have to be working in some case or

690
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,760
another or we have to either

691
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,959
substitute the control or reformat the

692
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,879
control or

693
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,400
make something else that's going to be

694
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,440
able to compensate

695
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,440
for that control so

696
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,720
i give out the what is security

697
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,320
performance engineering

698
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,919
it's a way to empower the program it's a

699
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,480
way to scale the effectiveness

700
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,760
it's a way to get data and instead of

701
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,840
making decisions

702
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,000
for people which is something that i

703
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,039
feel that the security industry has done

704
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,200
way too often what we want to do is

705
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,320
give people the data for them to make

706
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,960
better decisions

707
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,639
on their own i i'm not interested in

708
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,000
making the decision for them anymore

709
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,440
because at the end of the day then

710
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,880
they're like chris you screwed my

711
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,360
security program up

712
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,880
and it's not me uh what we really need

713
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,479
to do is start giving people and

714
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,280
empowering people with the data that

715
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,360
they need

716
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,039
in order to say are the tools effective

717
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,719
is the time effective is the process

718
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,640
effective or the people effective

719
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,240
all of those different things so we need

720
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,679
to start manifesting

721
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,080
how are we going to measure those

722
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,559
particular controls

723
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,678
all right first off we need a ruler

724
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,080
banana for scale

725
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,880
works for everybody so we'll start there

726
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,520
um

727
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,760
we have to figure out stuff that we have

728
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,480
in the environment what does it do

729
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,440
how does it do it why does it do it does

730
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,200
it fit

731
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,600
like does it does it actually fit in the

732
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,520
environment or you know has gartner

733
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,360
or one of the other research groups just

734
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,520
made us go out and buy this thing that's

735
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,479
completely ineffective and useful

736
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,158
or useless um you know i i i love i wish

737
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,080
i was standing in front of everyone to

738
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,000
be like how many people have a laugh

739
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,760
and everybody raises their hand i mean

740
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,600
like how many waffs have rules on them

741
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,320
and then like four people raises their

742
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,639
hand

743
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,080
um because it's true right we have all

744
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,400
this technology that's not

745
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,080
being used very effectively and most of

746
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,159
the reason for that is because

747
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,279
it's not accurate it's not reliable it's

748
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,440
not repeatable

749
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,039
it's basic performance measurements that

750
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,360
we're not getting out of it so we need

751
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,679
to

752
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,600
start figuring out how we're going to

753
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,880
measure their performance

754
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,678
all right so three concepts that i bring

755
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,240
to the table

756
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,039
for the potential of measuring security

757
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,120
performance

758
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,120
right effectiveness efficiency and

759
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,520
quality

760
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,199
these are if if any of you come from

761
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,559
performance engineering backgrounds

762
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,520
these are essentials

763
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,120
to performance engineering all right so

764
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,840
first we need to get an idea of

765
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,239
what is effective right in order to do

766
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,959
that we have to test it we have to say

767
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,240
did the blinky light thing that i bought

768
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,919
actually work

769
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,679
so if it says it's supposed to protect

770
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,760
against zero days fire

771
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,440
zero days at the thing and if it gets by

772
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,840
it doesn't work

773
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,279
if it if it gets stopped okay fine it

774
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,600
stopped that one but

775
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,039
out of how many so we need to start

776
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,480
figuring out how to do that from a

777
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,559
testing perspective

778
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,240
one of the things that i feel that we

779
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:59,600
did right in the beginning of the launch

780
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,760
of mitre and some of the attack

781
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,918
framework is that we provided a whole

782
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,039
bunch of examples for people to try and

783
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,200
test up by

784
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,760
for you to say all right i tried this

785
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,520
test it is working or not working

786
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,600
what we didn't take into account and i

787
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,440
think you know the sub controls are now

788
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,760
starting to take into account is

789
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,200
you know something like iran powershell

790
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,919
you're like oh well you can run

791
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,000
powershell

792
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,080
a million different ways have you

793
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,279
created a million use case tests in

794
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,320
order for you to say

795
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,600
i can or cannot detect bad powershell in

796
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,600
an environment

797
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,279
and i've been able to sexually do it 998

798
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,120
times out of 1000 or

799
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,679
6 times out of 1000 and what we ended up

800
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,158
with

801
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,120
is a whole lot of people using attack as

802
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,919
a bingo card

803
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,360
they were like yay i did all the things

804
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,080
i'm magically secure

805
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,520
because you know i kind of detected each

806
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,199
one of these controls i didn't

807
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,799
necessarily measure the quality i didn't

808
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,559
measure how fast it was going to go

809
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,879
it didn't measure if it was automated i

810
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,879
didn't even see if i could improve on it

811
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,880
but i did check the box so you know

812
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,200
everybody high five we're good to go on

813
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,279
to the next thing

814
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,799
so this provided a great taxonomy but it

815
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,720
didn't necessarily give us a level of

816
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,120
resolution that we need so my first

817
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,760
explanation inside of this is that we

818
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,360
need to go

819
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,279
in depth in our measurement we need to

820
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,039
get an understanding not only of

821
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,279
how well did we protect against the

822
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,158
control how well did we detect the

823
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,960
control

824
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,320
but what is the quality of our response

825
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,000
could it have been faster

826
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,918
did i have all the information that i

827
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,840
need is this something that says that i

828
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,440
need an orchestration platform

829
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,959
maybe i have all this awesome magic

830
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,880
scripting that just brings it all

831
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,120
together for me into a case file

832
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,799
maybe i have to spend hours upon hours

833
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,600
upon hours of hunting all of these

834
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,120
things out

835
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,600
to try and figure out what happened

836
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,600
before and after maybe i have some magic

837
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,279
ai system that figures all that crap out

838
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,000
for me and it's just perfect

839
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,520
who knows but what we don't have is a

840
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,799
standard system of measurements so the

841
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,158
first piece of that

842
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,039
is being able to measure the

843
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,080
effectiveness of those controls

844
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:05,520
all right second

845
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,000
inside of this telemetry effectiveness

846
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,639
is something

847
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,200
that we need to understand like i was

848
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,440
saying

849
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,640
from the protect standpoint from the

850
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,679
detex standpoint

851
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,520
but really to me the quality of response

852
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,039
over time is something that's super

853
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,440
important because

854
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,039
response can decay right we can see an

855
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,120
alert that comes up a whole bunch of

856
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,840
times we get alert fatigue we start to

857
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,479
mute it

858
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,320
right we have a bunch of controls in the

859
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,720
environment that may be mature and they

860
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,439
may continue their maturity over time

861
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,600
until the product just loses its mind

862
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,279
and magically it doesn't see it anymore

863
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,520
unless we're testing the level of

864
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,679
effectiveness that exists

865
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,600
for that particular tactic or for that

866
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,960
control we don't even know if we went

867
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,678
blind or not

868
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,000
so part of effectiveness is really this

869
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,279
kind of idea of a pre-flight checklist

870
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,840
to say

871
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,120
are my controls operating as they were

872
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,320
yesterday

873
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,479
are they equal to less than or

874
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,520
greater than those controls from

875
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,200
yesterday

876
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,399
and can i perceive and or predict what

877
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,279
those controls are going to look like

878
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,918
tomorrow

879
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,320
and if i could do that if i can say i

880
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,480
can

881
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,960
say without a doubt my controls are

882
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,360
operating as well as they were yesterday

883
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,399
and the things that i am going to do

884
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,158
today are going to

885
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,600
improve the level of control so if

886
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,679
someone measures it tomorrow

887
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,360
they will show a noticeable increase and

888
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,760
or difference

889
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,678
that will immeasurably change the

890
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,320
quality of our security program

891
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,080
right so we want to be able to account

892
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,960
for things like decay we want to be able

893
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,678
to measure

894
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,159
when something catches a bad dat file uh

895
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,840
you know

896
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,320
is it may be simple it may not be simple

897
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,199
but

898
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,039
certain things like oh well magically

899
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,720
this rockstar researcher

900
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,279
left this security company that we

901
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,840
invested all this money into

902
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,080
for some reason they're not catching all

903
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,879
these bleeding edge techniques anymore

904
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,080
i wonder why now the only reason we're

905
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,360
going to know that is because we're

906
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,559
testing those techniques

907
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,399
but if we're not testing those

908
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,559
techniques we don't have any direct

909
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,479
corollaries to understand if the product

910
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,080
life cycle is decay maybe that's

911
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,520
something that now needs to come up for

912
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,799
a refresh maybe it's something that's in

913
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,679
our target state architecture that's

914
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,080
going to give us

915
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,279
three or five or ten years down the road

916
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,639
it's going to say look we got to start

917
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,799
transitioning away from this

918
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,480
unless they start to catch up or maybe

919
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,879
we need to give our vendor a little poke

920
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,919
and go

921
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,600
hey all look you used to catch this

922
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,159
stuff and now you don't

923
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,360
what happened has is it because your

924
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,039
research team's dead

925
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,879
is because i'm getting the wrong thing

926
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,879
do i have to buy some other

927
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,559
you know magic second degree license

928
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,279
that makes me pay more that now starts

929
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,279
to see it

930
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,640
is a part of the product line or is the

931
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,840
product decaying and i have to start

932
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,039
switching off the product

933
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,039
so these are all hard facts that people

934
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,200
can use to determine the architecture of

935
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,039
the program the quality of the program

936
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,480
but we don't have to decide for them all

937
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:00,399
we have to do is provide them that data

938
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,960
i hope i'm not just like talking on mute

939
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:06,080
because it's so weird not to see people

940
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,640
anyway um quality

941
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,480
yes we did a thing but how good did we

942
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,320
do it

943
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,320
this is probably me and my talk this

944
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,918
morning it's two o'clock in the morning

945
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,000
and i'm trying to figure out how good

946
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,600
it is or isn't with any type of

947
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,080
measurement or feedback

948
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,879
so i have to i have to rely kind of on

949
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,960
quotes here

950
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,279
two most important things in any company

951
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,320
do not appear in its balance sheet

952
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:34,159
its reputation and its people

953
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,439
those are things that are about quality

954
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,520
right we have to understand that not

955
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,640
only are we here to just provide

956
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,600
data and just tell people yes you see it

957
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,000
no you didn't

958
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,879
but we have to understand what quality

959
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
really is

960
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,360
right do we have a way today to

961
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,159
measure the quality of our edr

962
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,080
the quality of our firewall the quality

963
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,880
of our net flow the quality of our

964
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,960
alerts

965
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,840
or do we have a way to measure the

966
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,159
quality of our response

967
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,080
right these are some of the things that

968
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,600
we have to start looking at in order to

969
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,559
give the right metrics

970
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,080
now when i think about metrics i think

971
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,120
about all these

972
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,960
super gangsters that are are just devops

973
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,719
heroes right

974
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,000
the met the level of measurement that

975
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,760
exists

976
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,720
inside of highly functioning devops

977
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,840
pipelines

978
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,880
is absolutely incredible to me when i

979
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,120
think about that

980
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,760
from how well are we doing as a security

981
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,399
community

982
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,600
at measuring the quality of what we

983
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,439
collectively me

984
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,799
what i'm delivering whether i'm

985
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,120
delivering a pen test

986
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,240
whether i'm delivering defenses whether

987
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,239
i'm delivering

988
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,919
you know detection engineering whether

989
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,919
i'm delivering dlp

990
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,120
endpoint blah blah blah but we could go

991
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,399
all the way through it

992
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,120
have i been able to show people the

993
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,158
quality of what i'm doing and that's

994
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,158
something that i believe

995
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,080
that we've we've really slacked on right

996
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,919
we haven't been able to get to this idea

997
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,480
of how many commits that we've had

998
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,159
how many how productive we are how well

999
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,880
that those commits have improved the

1000
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,320
environment

1001
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,399
we haven't transitioned to the idea of

1002
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,600
performance quality engineering what

1003
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,559
we've been doing

1004
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,559
is this kind of binary method of it's

1005
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,000
either secure or not secure oh i blocked

1006
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,879
it or i didn't block it

1007
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,679
not i blocked it 10 days out of 10 days

1008
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,360
or i block

1009
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,320
700 things every day for 365 days

1010
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,320
consistently

1011
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,519
right those are those types of metrics

1012
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,519
that start people to

1013
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,720
understand quality and they start to

1014
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,559
feel quality

1015
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,320
and when we look at the word security

1016
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,960
security is a feeling and i know i've

1017
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,799
said it a

1018
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,919
million times but the words security

1019
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,799
in every single language do not point to

1020
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,279
a computer

1021
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,480
they do not point to you know the

1022
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,960
ability to

1023
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,919
not be able to jump esp they don't be

1024
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,320
able to look at

1025
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,760
anything else but what they look at is

1026
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,678
how does it make you feel

1027
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,440
so we need to be able to give people

1028
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,279
things like proficiency

1029
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,279
based on the tool based on the alert

1030
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,000
based on the type we need to be able to

1031
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,000
understand

1032
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,039
training and how that translates into

1033
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,200
the environment

1034
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,559
if we're weak on a certain type of

1035
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,120
control i mean i know

1036
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,760
that some people might have a problem

1037
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,080
reversing one language versus another or

1038
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,480
dealing with packers or dealing with you

1039
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,240
know

1040
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,600
alternate data streams inside of

1041
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,039
protocol analysis

1042
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,719
all of those things are things that we

1043
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,640
can do tests on we can

1044
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,799
feed it back into the loop we can give

1045
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,039
performance metrics and we can go

1046
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,000
defender one versus defender three

1047
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,519
defender three is

1048
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,360
really really good at this one thing

1049
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,880
defender one isn't as good so let's get

1050
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,080
defender one training maybe from

1051
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,679
defender three

1052
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,918
and let's start routing tickets the

1053
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,039
right way let's improve the overall

1054
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,039
quality and delivery

1055
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,559
all right finally we have to look at

1056
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,000
efficiency

1057
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,000
right if we can show that we're

1058
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,320
delivering a quality service

1059
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,159
if we can measure the metrics and prove

1060
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,320
that it's working

1061
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,279
we have to start to gain efficiency so

1062
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,560
when we get to this

1063
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,239
idea of capability maturity once you get

1064
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,359
all the way up the highest levels of

1065
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,520
capability maturity

1066
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,119
you're no longer trying to replicate the

1067
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,320
process you're trying to tune and

1068
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,800
improve the process

1069
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,359
we're not getting to can i build a car

1070
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,760
it's can i run a formula one team

1071
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,399
can i make myself a millisecond factor

1072
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,000
faster

1073
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,598
do i have to re-engineer a whole

1074
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,320
steering assembly or a whole wheel

1075
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,800
assembly

1076
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,720
just to get a fraction of a second

1077
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,560
faster and that's the thing

1078
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,560
that once we get to this level of

1079
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,480
performance engineering and we get to be

1080
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,199
able to feed these metrics back into the

1081
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,440
program

1082
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,759
we really start to get to look at does

1083
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,960
our architecture support the continual

1084
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,960
growth of the organization

1085
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,079
all right so i'm sure you've probably

1086
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,399
seen these goals before

1087
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,399
right but you have the sort of effective

1088
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,118
and ineffective and efficient versus

1089
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,160
inefficient right the idea that what we

1090
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,800
want to try and do

1091
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,920
is be able to have something as high roi

1092
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,160
but is also cost

1093
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,000
effective is the magical unicorn

1094
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,440
situation and the only way we can really

1095
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,560
get to that situation

1096
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,119
is by having enough metrics to demystify

1097
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,400
what is maybe unimportant but seems

1098
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,599
important

1099
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,320
or maybe something that is super duper

1100
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,800
efficient

1101
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,440
but it really isn't very effective now

1102
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,839
this

1103
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,480
conversation this these four squares

1104
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,799
have caused people to buy so much crap

1105
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,000
in the security world that i can't even

1106
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,680
imagine right

1107
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,920
it's just there's there's this this

1108
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,440
overwhelming

1109
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,599
amount of of products that are sold

1110
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,119
because they claim to be very efficient

1111
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,040
but they're not very effective

1112
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,560
they claim to be super super effective

1113
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,079
but they're not very efficient

1114
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,599
and that makes up the bulk of the

1115
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,400
security world so until we start

1116
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,960
measuring

1117
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,560
their quality their effectiveness and

1118
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,320
then start getting down

1119
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,599
to how efficient they are we really

1120
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,079
don't realize that some of these

1121
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,560
decisions

1122
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,040
are being made in the environment right

1123
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,200
so efficiency telemetry to me

1124
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,880
is something that that is really a

1125
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,919
service level indicator

1126
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,119
now anyone who's done performance

1127
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,680
engineering this is

1128
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,400
mainstay for you right availability

1129
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,160
latency

1130
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,560
durability the ability to have coverage

1131
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,240
all of these things are something that

1132
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,320
we have found out through trial and

1133
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,200
error that i can say i have screwed up

1134
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,160
on my own a

1135
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,919
thousand times of of looking at things

1136
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,720
like you know take for instance

1137
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,200
iterating a ttp an attack right and i go

1138
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,520
oh great we can find it i wrote a rule

1139
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,960
it's awesome it fires every time this

1140
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,079
thing's

1141
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,359
x the box i'm ready to go and then i go

1142
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,880
oh okay well

1143
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:50,160
take that same ttp and replay it

1144
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,200
on every single vlan that exists in my

1145
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,839
environment

1146
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,359
and magically all of a sudden the thing

1147
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,759
that was a hundred percent

1148
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,040
totally awesome patting myself on the

1149
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,920
back for it

1150
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,440
sucks and i only caught it like two out

1151
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,160
of forty times

1152
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,839
now why well there's a myriad of reasons

1153
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,440
the log forwarder is down

1154
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,440
i didn't have the right tools in that

1155
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,520
environment there was you know

1156
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,200
some type of gremlin in the machine

1157
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,759
somebody made some acl

1158
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,040
that made it like not forward anymore

1159
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,960
you know it didn't run

1160
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,240
i couldn't connect to the host those

1161
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,680
freaked out died

1162
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,359
there's like all these different

1163
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,040
problems because

1164
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,720
i wasn't moving it around enough to

1165
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,599
really test the durability of that

1166
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,839
control

1167
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,760
to see if the efficiency was really

1168
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,200
there so

1169
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,119
one of the things that we start to do is

1170
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,040
once we start looking at efficiency

1171
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,040
we start saying all right you know i got

1172
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,720
my idea of quality i've been able to

1173
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,400
understand that can i tweak it can i

1174
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,560
make it measurably better

1175
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,640
every time i iterate it and can i

1176
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,599
iterate it in multiple different areas

1177
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,598
and facets

1178
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,760
in order to use that iteration the

1179
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,920
geography of that iteration

1180
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,359
to make it better and and that's

1181
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,040
something whether it's an

1182
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,720
external influence whether it's an

1183
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,359
internal influence whether it's error

1184
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,480
rates

1185
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,440
i mean how many times have we gotten to

1186
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,160
a point where we

1187
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,119
correlated that the reason i missed the

1188
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,920
signal

1189
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,040
the reason that i missed a problem in

1190
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,400
the environment

1191
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:19,440
was because one piece of one of my log

1192
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,320
forwarding in the chain happened to have

1193
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,400
too much cpu utilization at the moment

1194
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,720
that it needed to log the event and then

1195
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,240
the log forwarder overwrote in between

1196
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,919
that time that it needed to get to my

1197
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,118
sam in order for my alert

1198
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,800
to hit my console i bet

1199
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,480
that if you guys have been doing

1200
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,480
detection engineering for quite a while

1201
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,839
you have found that problem before

1202
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,520
but until we start testing that

1203
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,279
regularly over and over

1204
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,359
we can't really make enough case back to

1205
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,800
the business to say these are efficiency

1206
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,680
controls that we need to be able to

1207
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,320
manipulate

1208
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,879
in order for us to get to a point of

1209
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,520
having

1210
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,200
solid detection engineering having solid

1211
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,800
efficiency being able to feed back to

1212
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,078
the program and showing them

1213
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,200
those net positive improvements um now i

1214
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,000
get that i've been just

1215
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,520
rambling on and on and on and i saw a

1216
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,160
bunch of different things come up in

1217
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,800
chat

1218
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,399
um so one of them was this is also very

1219
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,839
difficult question

1220
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,000
hold on i'm trying to go through it

1221
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,759
shots

1222
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,800
so a difficult question if we choose the

1223
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,560
wrong metrics

1224
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,760
best case doesn't mean anything worst

1225
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,720
case we are promoting the wrong

1226
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,839
behaviors

1227
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,040
agree um i think that the things that we

1228
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,078
have to look at

1229
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,160
when we are trying to figure out what

1230
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,280
metrics are we going to measure

1231
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,240
is metrics that are known

1232
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,960
a lot of the times as security engineers

1233
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,799
you know

1234
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,800
whatever we want to call ourselves you

1235
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,680
know hackers defenders red blue

1236
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,040
purple pink whatever we are um i think

1237
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,399
that a lot of times we

1238
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,920
we work so hard to make the fringe case

1239
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,040
just to prove everybody else is wrong or

1240
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,760
right or whatever else

1241
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,480
that we forget that known bad is known

1242
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,240
bad

1243
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,680
so what we need to start with in the

1244
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,240
environment is

1245
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,839
effective known bad and so we can

1246
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,520
replicate those things and we can

1247
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,359
understand how that relays across the

1248
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,079
environment and we can start making our

1249
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,440
use cases and as we start to bridge

1250
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,599
this identity of known bad versus

1251
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,920
kind of bad versus every once in a while

1252
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,760
is bad it's really something we're using

1253
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,119
to expand the control base so

1254
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,040
you know let's say you started with

1255
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,400
something like attack what you'll find

1256
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,839
is you're going to go through attack and

1257
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,160
you know half the controls are going to

1258
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,078
be

1259
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,359
known bad the other half of the controls

1260
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,960
are going to be things that you found

1261
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,799
that your environment does

1262
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,000
that people actually use in the

1263
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,240
environment i mean you know

1264
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,319
yes guess what people still use net

1265
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,799
commands and they use them legitimately

1266
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,599
now

1267
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,200
yes also attackers do but people also

1268
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,680
legitimately use them so

1269
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,598
we have to understand kind of the the

1270
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,279
the level of durability and that kind of

1271
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,319
elastic resistance for us to get an

1272
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,520
understanding of

1273
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,440
what are the things we're going to

1274
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,920
measure what are the things that we know

1275
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,480
at a reasonable degree of certainty or

1276
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,480
bad

1277
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,319
and then start expanding our data set

1278
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,880
from there and as we start to expand the

1279
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,880
data set

1280
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,240
we start to disambiguate the data set

1281
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,520
and then we can start training these

1282
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,160
different learning engines and stuff

1283
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,759
like that

1284
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,240
but we have to start with something that

1285
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,240
is measurable that's repeatable

1286
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,799
and that we can tune its level of

1287
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:21,839
effectiveness

1288
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,839
all right

1289
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,880
you
