1
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,480
all right

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,119
uh good morning everyone from chicago uh

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,119
really happy to uh joining uh good

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,080
morning everyone from chicago

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,519
uh really happy to uh join you guys via

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,278
recorder presentation i'm on the middle

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,639
of some paternity leave uh so i wasn't

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,759
able to do this live hopefully i'll be

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,599
able to

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,359
uh join for some question answers

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,680
afterwards but really excited to take

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,000
you guys on a cyber safari

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,040
looking at under examined threat actors

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,920
from the global threat landscape

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,160
and so typically discussions around

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,800
state nexus threat actors focus on

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,879
bears from russia pandas from china

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,000
colomas from north korea

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,718
and kittens from iran

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,160
and those are great and they tend to be

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,039
high profile but the global threat

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,640
landscape includes enough activity from

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,920
the cranes of south korea leopards of

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,519
pakistan buffalos of vietnam and more

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,680
to constitute and be worth the whole

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,799
cyber safari of underexamined threat

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,640
actors

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,320
this subset of adversaries represents

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,240
the proliferation of how more and more

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,960
governments are using

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,920
state nexus actors and increasingly

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,839
conducting

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,920
targeted intrusions inten on

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,520
capitalizing on the asymmetric

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,720
advantages offered by those cyber

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,720
operations

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,479
by examining these actors their activity

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,920
their victims

39
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,320
we can see the diversity of their

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,200
motivations different methodologies and

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,758
capabilities

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,200
they use and their targets this allows

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,200
for more accurate and complete

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,200
understanding of how truly global

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,880
the threat landscape is and subsequently

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,920
better tailor our threat models

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,360
and defensive postures for

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,439
the blue teamers that are watching this

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,040
hopefully you'll be able to improve

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,720
your threat models especially for

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,680
regional threats and

52
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,280
for uh your red teamers hopefully um you

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,320
see some really interesting campaigns

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,079
that you might give

55
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,600
might give you some ideas uh for your

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,520
next engagement

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,960
uh we won't be covering any of the big

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,079
four that we just talked about

59
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,759
um because there's already a ton of

60
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,079
excellent reporting on them we're also

61
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,760
not going to be covering five eyes

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,360
because i don't think they actually do

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,480
any offensive operations

64
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,120
that i know about at least uh so who i

65
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,599
am

66
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,400
my name is yoshi uh also known i also go

67
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,160
by josh

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,640
uh safari guy today i currently work

69
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,560
in healthcare cyber through intelligence

70
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,238
and have a couple certifications

71
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,959
my background's actually in political

72
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,920
science international relations

73
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,840
where i really enjoy the geopolitical

74
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,640
aspect to the threat intelligence

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,760
landscape formerly with the fbi before i

76
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,920
joined

77
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,799
healthcare and you can follow me on

78
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,599
twitter if you

79
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,760
so desire so as we get started

80
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,359
there's a lot of different models when

81
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,359
you talk about adversaries

82
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,560
the diamond model is one of the oldest

83
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
and in my opinion

84
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,000
one of the better ways to start thinking

85
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,760
about these thread actors

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,360
and how to understand and cluster them

87
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,959
so when we

88
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,840
talk about the diamond model the first

89
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,440
thing we usually talk about is

90
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,440
infrastructure

91
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,959
infrastructure just means anything from

92
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,079
the email accounts used for spear

93
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,959
phishing

94
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,720
command control servers or domains maybe

95
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,720
even their ip addresses

96
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,480
really that tangible those tangible

97
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,159
things

98
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,480
next is victim so when we talk about

99
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,720
victim i think victim can be more

100
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,238
diverse than people typically think

101
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,400
it's not just the organization or

102
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,799
company that's targeted but also maybe

103
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,720
what

104
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,440
individual position are they targeting

105
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,840
cfos are they targeting hr departments

106
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,120
um are they targeting research and

107
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,720
development

108
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200
and then also specific data are they

109
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,359
after payment card data are they after

110
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,720
um different um

111
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,599
research uh for example 19 vaccines

112
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,720
or are they um just after anything and

113
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,200
everything

114
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,840
uh and then also the vertical so are

115
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,439
they targeting

116
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,879
um aerospace engineering are they

117
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,040
targeting healthcare

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,959
that's the thing we look at a lot uh in

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,560
my current current role

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,040
and then next is capability so

121
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,640
capabilities are usually dependent on

122
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,879
technical intelligence like malware

123
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,320
reversing and ties well to a model like

124
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,159
miters attack

125
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,079
i think that really helps put a common

126
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,120
language on what capabilities

127
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,320
are and what actors are doing not it

128
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,000
doesn't cover everything but for the

129
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,560
most part gives a common language for

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,040
both red teams and blue teams

131
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,160
and finally it's adversary depending on

132
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,520
who you're talking to

133
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,440
and or working for adversary can range

134
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,039
from the person behind the keyboard

135
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,040
the organization that they work for

136
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,880
whether it's a front company or actual

137
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,000
state military unit or even the customer

138
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,199
who said hey

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,600
we have a requirement for this

140
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,639
information and sponsored the campaign

141
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,240
or intrusion

142
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,840
for that information again that varies a

143
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,840
lot based off of who you're working with

144
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,199
so when we talk about that adversary i

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
think it's also important to talk about

146
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,479
different

147
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,680
aspects of national responsibility so

148
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,120
starting at the bottom here we have

149
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,560
state prohibited

150
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,800
that's where the national government

151
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,479
will help stop the third party attack

152
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,039
good example that is going to be in the

153
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,400
united states you see people that are

154
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,599
arrested extradited or prosecuted for

155
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,880
conducting

156
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,800
cyber operations next is state

157
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,560
prohibited but inadequate

158
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,240
the national government is cooperative

159
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,800
and wants to stop the third parties but

160
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,840
they're

161
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,120
unable to they just don't have the

162
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,159
capability personnel

163
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,479
resources or sometimes even authorities

164
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,840
the next is state ignored so the

165
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,359
national government knows about the

166
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,520
third party attacks but it's unwilling

167
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,680
to take any official action

168
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,120
and one caveat here when i say tax i i

169
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,400
mean cyber operations

170
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,320
in general not limited to just

171
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,159
cna attacks just overall cyber

172
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,520
operations both espionage related

173
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,960
financially motivated

174
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,359
and then also those destructive attacks

175
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,198
next we have state encouraged so third

176
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
parties control and conduct the attack

177
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,360
but the national government encourages

178
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,240
them as a model

179
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,759
matter of policy a great example of this

180
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,639
are the iranian hacktivists

181
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,160
who are defacing web pages uh leaving

182
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,199
nationalistic

183
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,720
defacements but aren't operating

184
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,479
strictly on the behalf of the iranian

185
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,600
government

186
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,120
um next would be state shapes so third

187
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,720
parties control and conduct the attack

188
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,840
maybe as part of a front company of some

189
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,800
sort

190
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,000
but the national government does provide

191
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,960
some support to that

192
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,800
front company payment infrastructure

193
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,560
protection that sort of thing

194
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,240
state coordinated uh the national

195
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,960
government coordinates with third party

196
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,720
attacks

197
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
by suggesting operational details and

198
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,639
that's really where you get into that

199
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,400
those front companies that are

200
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:56,000
operating on behalf of the government

201
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,359
so next uh very similar is state ordered

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,720
uh the national government directs

203
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,240
third-party proxies to conduct the

204
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,800
attack on its behalf

205
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,280
very similar to state coordinated um

206
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,160
just

207
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,919
suggestion versus direction uh next

208
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,039
would be state road conducted so these

209
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,120
are the out of control

210
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,120
elements of cyber forces on the national

211
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,560
governments conducting the attack

212
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,800
a good example this would be

213
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,319
freelancers for say north korea or china

214
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,199
who conduct intrusions for the

215
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,599
government during the day

216
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,720
and then line their own pocketbooks at

217
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,639
night

218
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,319
for some financially motivated attacks

219
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,919
next is state executed where the

220
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,400
national government is conducting the

221
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,919
attacks

222
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,359
using cyber forces under their direct

223
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,198
control uh uniform military and or

224
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,199
uh intelligence services actually doing

225
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,919
the attacks or operations

226
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,039
and then the the pyramid or the apex if

227
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,120
you will

228
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,000
would be national government attacking

229
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,960
using integrated third party proxies and

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,960
government forces

231
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,318
so this is just a quick look our safari

232
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,400
will include looking at the netherlands

233
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,879
france spain turkey israel

234
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,080
united arab emirates uzbekistan pakistan

235
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,360
india south korea

236
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,359
vietnam and some south american sets

237
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,080
so as we get started um

238
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,120
we're going to start off with one of the

239
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,719
more advanced groups that's been

240
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,400
publicly talked about

241
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,560
if you ask most people to talk about

242
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,679
some of the best attackers in the world

243
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,080
most people won't mention the

244
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,280
netherlands but in 2018 a dutch

245
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,960
newspaper

246
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,559
revealed one of the most sophisticated

247
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,198
and successful hacking operations

248
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,760
which is against the apt cozy bear

249
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,800
apt-29

250
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,640
the dutch managed to get a clue into

251
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,838
cozy bear's operations they literally

252
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,799
identified the building they were

253
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,479
sitting in

254
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,560
of course this was pre-coveted so there

255
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
was no work from home

256
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,680
and based off their good preparation and

257
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,680
planning they were able to do more than

258
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,880
just pop boxes on the network

259
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,479
but they're able to hack into the

260
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,640
security cameras and record everyone

261
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,080
coming and going from the operation

262
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,760
so not only did they have access to the

263
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,839
network to identify

264
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,839
attacks they also identified individual

265
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,600
hackers and officials coming going from

266
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,000
the building

267
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,640
so this allowed this access allowed the

268
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,240
dutch

269
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,839
according to this newspaper to tip off

270
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,040
the americans once cozy breasts started

271
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,279
attacking

272
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,360
the state department and they gave them

273
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,560
information about russia capabilities

274
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,080
c2 infrastructure their targets etc

275
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,680
additionally because they had those

276
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,800
security cameras they were allowed they

277
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,599
were able to

278
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,880
attribute cozy bear to the svr um based

279
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,279
off the intelligence officers that were

280
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,439
going to and from the building

281
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,439
and this is just one snapshot into what

282
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,440
an advanced actor could do

283
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,959
with the right opportunity preparation

284
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,760
and patience

285
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:46,880
and a really good attack

286
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,000
so next we have france which is babar or

287
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,720
animal farm originated in 2007

288
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,160
targeting iran syria mali malaysia and

289
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,160
others

290
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,000
it had a pretty diverse set of malware

291
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,640
and was extremely targeted compared to

292
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,920
some other

293
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,360
groups that have more wide range

294
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,680
animal farm was very targeted

295
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,360
one thing to note was that according to

296
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,160
french law french cyber command does

297
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:18,160
have authority to do offensive hacking

298
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:20,480
and sometimes will do so

299
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,160
so next we have spain which is known as

300
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,399
the mask of correcto

301
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,439
uh it started in 2007 attributed in 2014

302
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,560
over 380 victims identified 31 countries

303
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,720
targeted

304
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,680
including governments energy research

305
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,200
institutions

306
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,560
activists private equity firms now they

307
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,320
were discovered when they tried to

308
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,839
exploit a patched vulnerability in a

309
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,880
kaspersky product

310
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,959
and they actually shut down their

311
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,600
operations when they were sinkholed when

312
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,760
their

313
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,079
c2 infrastructure was sinkholed

314
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,319
attribution was identified based off of

315
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,399
who information who is information

316
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
as well as spanish language remnants in

317
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,440
their malware

318
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,680
and one thing before we go forward or

319
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,079
further i do reference a lot of

320
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,079
different

321
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,839
research from variety of groups uh

322
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,800
kaspersky eset

323
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,880
um crowdstrike a lot of uh good firms so

324
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,599
all of my sources will be cited in the

325
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,040
at the end uh please if you have any

326
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
interest in reading the actual reports

327
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,519
please go and read them there's some

328
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,040
excellent reporting

329
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,640
that people have done

330
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,079
so next we're going to talk about turkey

331
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,079
this is actually a lot of turkey

332
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,680
and so when we talk about turkey the

333
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,000
first third actor we're going to talk

334
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,920
about

335
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,920
is strong pity or prometheum

336
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,319
in december of 2016 microsoft released

337
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,760
reporting that indicated prometheum had

338
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,760
been operating since 2012.

339
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,000
they've been targeting both domestic and

340
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,040
international targets

341
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,480
um and microsoft

342
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,240
uh identified that they were targeting

343
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,680
specific individuals within a specific

344
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,560
area in europe

345
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,719
um their 2016 campaign included a zero

346
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,119
day in adobe and was actually delivered

347
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,959
via instant message client

348
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,720
strong pity has also been known to use

349
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,000
phishing links along with strategic web

350
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,040
compromising

351
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,519
or compromises or watering holes as the

352
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,839
initial inspection vector

353
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,120
interestingly enough they do also use

354
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,000
trojanized encrypters

355
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,800
and other apps particularly to target

356
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,399
users in italy and belgium

357
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,920
kaspersky did an excellent job

358
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,160
documenting

359
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,519
trovar cis the malware that was dropped

360
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,079
after the initial infection

361
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,839
by strong pity the malware is often

362
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,800
bundled with legitimate installers and

363
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,079
often include

364
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,199
includes lures in turkish this combined

365
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,719
with the local setting

366
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:43,279
of most of the victims helped attribute

367
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,920
them to turkey the 2016 campaign

368
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,639
also had multiple similarities with the

369
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,240
odium

370
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,320
a group that likely used finn fisher

371
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,680
malware for espionage purposes

372
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,519
and we'll talk about that a little bit

373
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,439
later

374
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,519
um so another really unique group coming

375
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,760
out of turkey is known as sea turtle

376
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,279
in april of 2019 uh cisco towels

377
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,160
reported on a group they identified as

378
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,760
sea turtle

379
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,600
the group targeted national security

380
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,480
organizations in the middle east and

381
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,399
north africa

382
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,880
and included cyprus greece iraq albania

383
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,760
egypt armenia uae jordan syria and

384
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
sweden

385
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,680
that's according to cisco and i think

386
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,719
reuters as well as domain tools put out

387
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,839
some great research on these guys

388
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,920
assuming they are guys let's see

389
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,279
so sea turtle executed what's known as

390
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,399
the first public example

391
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,240
of widespread dns hijacking they were

392
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,959
extremely successful by first targeting

393
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,000
third parties like dns registrars

394
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,719
telecommunication companies and isps

395
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,800
internet service providers once they

396
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,639
gained access to these targets

397
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,160
using mostly known vulnerabilities and

398
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,160
in some instances

399
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,000
phishing they were able to hijack the

400
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,319
dns of their primary targets which were

401
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,079
those national security organizations

402
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,839
by doing this they were able to redirect

403
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,120
legitimate users to active controlled

404
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
infrastructure

405
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,079
that allowed them to intercept and

406
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,839
harvest their credentials

407
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,760
according to routers credentials

408
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,399
included email services cloud storage

409
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,959
servers and online networks

410
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,880
redux based their attribution to sources

411
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,719
that cited three things first

412
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,959
victimology like we talked about

413
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,720
similarly similarities to past

414
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,119
campaigns as well as confidential

415
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,040
intelligence

416
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,880
and those are just two thoughts from

417
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,880
turkey that i find pretty interesting

418
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,839
so obviously there is a ton that can be

419
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,560
said about israeli cyber security

420
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,519
um one of the things i'll cover today is

421
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,760
just one example

422
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,760
fourth possibly fifth party collection

423
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,279
or what's known as hacking hackers so

424
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,000
the new york times report on the story

425
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,240
where

426
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,199
the israelis had hacked into kaspersky

427
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,880
to gather intelligence in 2015.

428
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,880
this campaign was identified as doogoo

429
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,720
2.0 by kaspersky

430
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,560
the israelis were allegedly able to

431
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,160
identify russian hackers inside of

432
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,479
kaspersky that were searching for

433
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,120
intelligence on american programs

434
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,480
so you have the israelis that identified

435
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,839
the russian hackers

436
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,120
that identified inside kaspersky

437
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,760
that was looking at american programs

438
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,519
the hacker store store stole passwords

439
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,600
and documents and screenshots

440
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,760
as well as emails related to case versus

441
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,800
apt work uh particularly those related

442
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,160
to the equation group

443
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,199
and region other targets of the

444
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,480
israeli campaign as identified by

445
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,319
kaspersky

446
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,240
uh included hotels uh based in the u.s

447
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,000
that were related to the u.n security

448
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,360
council negotiations on jp

449
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,800
koa which was the iran deal kaspersky

450
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,000
blog is really good

451
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,800
so recommend reading it if you're

452
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,399
interested in dooku 2.0

453
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,160
uh and then when you talk about israeli

454
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,320
cyber security uh it's also important to

455
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,759
talk about private companies in israel

456
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,759
uh and one of the best known is nso

457
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,040
nso is currently embroiled in a lawsuit

458
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,560
against facebook

459
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:04,399
for using a vulnerability in whatsapp

460
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,719
nso tools like phantom and pegasus

461
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,759
are only supposed to be used by state

462
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,920
ordered organizations for

463
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,600
counterterrorism and other missions

464
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,439
but vice has reported that human rights

465
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,959
dissidents journalists and political

466
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
opponents have also been targeted by

467
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,079
those

468
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,360
nso tools one of the reasons i think

469
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,719
it's interesting to bring this up is

470
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,560
that

471
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,320
when we talk about actual real campaigns

472
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,199
this is a great example of what to look

473
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,040
for

474
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,599
um some advice showed that some of the

475
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,599
domains used for lures appear to be

476
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,279
innocent unsubscribe links or other

477
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,279
facebook links

478
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,040
or links masquerading as facebook

479
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,480
the infrastructure was often procured

480
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,240
from cloud providers located in the

481
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,800
united states

482
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,079
so it looks pretty legitimate and it's

483
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,719
definitely something to watch

484
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,160
going forward as more information

485
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
informations revealed throughout the

486
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,719
court case

487
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,439
so next we have lebanon and lebanon is

488
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,040
really interesting

489
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,639
dark karakol is the name of the group

490
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,880
there so

491
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,559
the eff and lookout identified dark

492
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,400
karakol um

493
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,079
as in threat actor allegedly supporting

494
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,959
the general directorate of general

495
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,599
security

496
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,600
in lebanon

497
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,240
dark karakol was originally identified

498
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,480
in part because of the infrastructure

499
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,640
reused from operation manuel

500
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,000
uh which we'll briefly discuss later

501
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,679
dark karakol

502
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,039
is considered an apt for a couple

503
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,360
reasons the first being

504
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,640
numerous campaigns in parallel uh

505
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,399
hundreds of gigabytes of data

506
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,160
exfiltrated

507
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,919
and then the typical targets of

508
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,919
government military

509
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,120
utility financial institutions health

510
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,120
care manufacturers

511
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,080
exfiltrated data all that data included

512
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,520
documents call records recordings

513
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,960
contacts photos account information

514
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,080
an interesting thing about this is that

515
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,400
it was primarily mobile malware focused

516
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,840
as a primary attack platform so initial

517
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,919
access included the usual

518
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,600
phishing and social engineering but then

519
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,360
also included physical access to the

520
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,719
target devices which

521
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,760
is definitely something that's useful

522
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,760
for state nexus operations

523
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,960
paulus which is the malware used was a

524
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,160
trojanized and android apps as well

525
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,840
some finn fisher mower

526
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,440
was also used which is the operation

527
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,480
manuel

528
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,559
link other malware use included

529
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,480
banducrat and crossrat

530
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,799
while the infrastructure being used

531
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,720
seemed to be shared with multiple actors

532
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,320
the eff was able to fingerprint some of

533
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,720
it rather uniquely and that's really

534
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,240
where the attribution came from

535
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,000
so once they identified uh

536
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,160
the infrastructure being used by dark

537
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,679
karakol they were able to identify

538
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,080
that some of the logs had actually been

539
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,360
left open and unsecured

540
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,080
so based off those open logs testing and

541
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,760
testing devices were identified and the

542
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,120
wi-fi networks associated with those

543
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,679
devices

544
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,320
were then identified and happened to be

545
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,520
in a

546
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,360
very close vicinity to a building

547
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,918
owned by the general director of general

548
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,678
security

549
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,240
additionally the command control address

550
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,520
was controlled by three ip addresses

551
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,440
that belong to the lebanese

552
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,440
government-owned oguero telecom

553
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,960
so next we have the united arab emirates

554
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,679
and stealth falcon

555
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,200
fruity armor so in 2016 the intercept

556
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,960
published an article detailing dark

557
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,720
matter's recruitment of cyber personnel

558
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,679
from a variety of countries

559
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,360
to conduct offensive operations uh their

560
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,480
report was followed up with reported by

561
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,039
reuters that showed

562
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,960
nsa hackers that were hacking for a

563
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,240
group known as project raven

564
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,919
from a mansion in abu dhabi alleged

565
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,840
targets include human rights activists

566
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,840
journalists and political rivals

567
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,918
the manual used which is called karma

568
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,399
did not require any user interaction and

569
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,200
obtained

570
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,039
photos text and location information

571
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,240
it's hypothesized that it actually used

572
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,240
an imessage zero day

573
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,520
also in 2016 citizen lab published a

574
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,360
report on stealth falcon

575
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,879
the group that conducted a large scale

576
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,280
campaign

577
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,120
against uae government critics the

578
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,799
actors first profiled a user's device

579
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,080
with a redirect link and then later in

580
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,240
the conversation fished them with an

581
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,678
actual malicious document

582
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,440
that eventually returned to custom

583
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,799
powershell uh backdoor

584
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,600
similar to powershell empire so uh

585
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,280
then fast forward to 2019 eset published

586
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,120
a report about a binary that

587
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,879
bears a remarkable similarity to the

588
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,320
powershell backdoor

589
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,919
disclosed in 2016 by citizen lab

590
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,559
they noted targets in the united arab

591
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,320
emirates uh saudi arabia thailand and a

592
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,440
middle eastern diplomatic mission to the

593
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,200
netherlands

594
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,640
the binary also uses one of the same

595
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,360
command and control domains

596
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,400
as this powershell backdoor so that's

597
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,080
where they drew

598
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,080
additional uh context

599
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,440
so really it's interesting to see both

600
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:03,439
the domestic and foreign targeting again

601
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,640
by the united arab emirates

602
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,559
so when we talk about morocco um

603
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,159
i thought this was kind of interesting

604
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,799
because i wasn't really

605
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,760
expecting to find much on them but in

606
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,559
2018

607
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,520
the security company hires found tax

608
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,918
against a variety

609
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,360
of french industrial firms after

610
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,039
sinkhole in the domain

611
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,600
they researched the register information

612
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,440
and eventually found an email address

613
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,719
that aligned to a dns server for the

614
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,120
malware campaign

615
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,120
in march of 2020 uh brian krebs took

616
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,520
that email address did what he did best

617
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,280
traced it through some forms and doxxed

618
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,000
a moroccan security researcher who was

619
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,200
tied to the forum posts in the email

620
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,799
of course the security researchers

621
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,159
denies being affiliated with the french

622
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,600
malware campaign

623
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,760
uh because his email was quote unquote

624
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,600
hacked and that campaign

625
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,240
did use njrat so we all know that um

626
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,158
krebs is great at tracing emails and

627
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,360
identifying individuals

628
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,280
but at this point we don't know who

629
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,879
directed or sponsored the intrusion

630
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,799
and we may never know who was targeting

631
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,480
those french industrial firms

632
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,799
using the quote-unquote security

633
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,799
researcher from morocco who got hacked

634
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,480
allegedly

635
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,399
so next is uzbekistan so they weren't on

636
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,280
my radar as a player in iphone's

637
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,720
offensive cyber operations prior to this

638
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,158
my research here but

639
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,799
they've been around for a while their

640
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,159
national secret police the sss

641
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,639
first took interest in commercial

642
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,960
hacking tools started in 2011

643
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,120
and came to light by the attacking team

644
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,440
dumps by phineas fisher

645
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,360
then in 2019 brian bartholomew from

646
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,280
kaspersky presented on an apt

647
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,479
they tied to uzbekistan's intelligence

648
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,639
agency

649
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,600
the strong attribution to the sss was

650
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,280
possible

651
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,520
in part due to horrible opsec by the

652
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,158
individual operators

653
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,120
based off of who is they were able to

654
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,720
identify

655
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,678
the actual military unit as well as the

656
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,080
military officer's name

657
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,880
who was behind the behind the domains

658
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,678
behind the unit

659
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,000
or side behind the campaign that's just

660
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,440
the first optic failure

661
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,679
additionally the operators were testing

662
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,440
their software in the zero days they buy

663
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,679
on computers that had conspiracy

664
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,440
antivirus on testing machines

665
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,200
um conspiracy team was able to grab

666
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,240
three other purchase zero days

667
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,559
um from sand cat which then burned them

668
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,480
for

669
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,000
anyone else who had bought them and they

670
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,600
were able to identify other information

671
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,120
for their campaigns before they were

672
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,120
even used

673
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,399
so it shows that the sort of visibility

674
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,520
that some of the vendors

675
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,159
outside of the the

676
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,600
larger vendors is excellent for hunting

677
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,640
these smaller adversaries they're really

678
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,120
those regional vendors

679
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,720
see a lot of really interesting things

680
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,678
and telemetry that some other

681
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,679
companies may not see

682
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,039
so next we have this beautiful picture

683
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,880
from pakistan

684
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,000
so there's there's two groups attributed

685
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,279
to pakistan we're going to talk about

686
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,360
today

687
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,360
the first is interesting it's the gorgon

688
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,760
group because they

689
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,199
have targeted both criminal as well as

690
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,559
targeted espionage

691
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,640
campaigns in february of 2018

692
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,320
unit 42 identified the gorgon group

693
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,080
as targeting governments in the united

694
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,279
kingdom spain russia and the united

695
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,879
states

696
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,679
and those same campaigns use shared

697
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,440
infrastructure with

698
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,720
some financially motivated campaigns

699
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,480
another notable thing from this

700
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,679
campaign is they use url shortening

701
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,960
services to actually download the

702
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,200
payloads

703
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,840
this allowed both the campaign operators

704
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,960
but then also researchers statistical

705
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,639
click counts and visibility when we talk

706
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,679
about the capabilities for the go around

707
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,320
group

708
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,120
i use a variety of rats including nj rat

709
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,960
like we've seen

710
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,959
other groups use as well as info

711
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,919
stealers like loki bot

712
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,400
um in october of 2019 prevailion talked

713
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,400
about another gold ground group campaign

714
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,080
where the alert documents again used url

715
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,200
shortening services to redirect

716
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,039
to blocks blogspot urls hosting

717
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,080
malicious javascript

718
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,320
that javascript ran a

719
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,158
code that was found on pastebin and then

720
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,720
which established persistence

721
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,440
via schedule task and registry keys and

722
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,279
then another pastebrand url was accessed

723
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,760
that infection chain eventually led to a

724
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,960
rat that was either typically revenge

725
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,960
rat or azeroalt

726
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,600
the other apt tied to pakistan is

727
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,840
transparent tribe

728
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,840
also known as mythic library or apt-36

729
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,360
primarily targeting military and

730
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,240
diplomatic targets

731
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,240
primarily indian

732
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,799
in 2016 proof points darin huss

733
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,559
published some research

734
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,240
identifying phishing attacks on indian

735
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,399
military resources

736
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,760
these fish included a weaponized rtf

737
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,120
document that eventually dropped a

738
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,080
portable executable

739
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,520
that eventually led to a rat in addition

740
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,000
to the phishing campaign you

741
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,918
they also saw a strategic web compromise

742
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,760
blog or lure blog

743
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,080
that was set up for indian military

744
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,919
users they included fake articles about

745
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,120
the indian military to entice users to

746
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,720
click on it

747
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,158
and it was a dual pronged approach for

748
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,480
that campaign

749
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:15,360
which is decently unique um

750
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,960
so and then in 2017 cis info reported

751
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,840
actors that allegedly linked

752
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,440
um a link to transparent tribe targeting

753
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,039
officials in the indian central bureau

754
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,159
of investigation as well as the indian

755
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,039
army

756
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,720
uh this continued their uh transparent

757
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,559
tribes historic targeting of the indian

758
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,559
government officials

759
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,320
and in may of 2018 crowdstrike reported

760
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,279
that mythic leopard continued to use

761
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,279
generic themed excel documents as lures

762
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,039
they paired well with a unique visual

763
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,799
basic script to install a variety of

764
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,400
implants

765
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,320
similar to what proof point identified

766
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,840
crowdstrike identified mythic leopard

767
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,840
c2s that continued

768
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,439
to be reused against comp against

769
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,240
campaigns

770
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,080
um in march malwarebytes reported that

771
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,159
this actor had now begun using

772
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,080
uh covenanting related lures and in

773
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,919
addition to those lures the

774
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,480
apt had also increased their targeting

775
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,320
to include targets in afghanistan

776
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,520
and then just recently uh kaspersky's

777
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,000
put out some uh

778
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,799
new reporting on an android implant that

779
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,799
they tied

780
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,639
to transparent tribe uh that's

781
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,039
definitely worth looking at

782
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,039
as well

783
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,480
a beautiful tiger from india so let me

784
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,799
first start by saying that india is a

785
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,520
mess as far as cyber attribution goes

786
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,799
both state supported and criminal

787
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,240
operations we're going to look at some

788
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,679
interesting campaigns

789
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,960
that have a nexus to india and talk

790
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,840
about different threat groups that have

791
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,840
been reported on

792
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,960
but and nowhere will this be exhaustive

793
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,640
in march of 2018 a chinese security

794
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,960
vendor reported that a large number of

795
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,480
highly targeted spear phishing attacks

796
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,880
targeted sensitive chinese government

797
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,720
agencies in this campaign the alert

798
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,159
document ended up dropping a.net

799
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,399
executable

800
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,279
that related to case rat scheduled tests

801
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,279
and eventually led to x-ray as well

802
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,960
documents were exfiltrated via post to

803
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,559
the command control

804
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,399
veloxity and other security vendor

805
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,279
reported a similar campaign from

806
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,199
the same time frame in their report they

807
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,120
identified campaigns that also directly

808
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,760
attacked us think tanks

809
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,959
in addition to the malware alerts

810
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,960
patchwork which is

811
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,240
who they attribute the campaign to did

812
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,480
something unique by

813
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,480
using an embedded image tag that beating

814
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,159
back to the attacker's domain

815
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,600
that embedded image tag was unique so

816
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,320
attackers could see who had clicked on

817
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,799
their links

818
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,960
successfully again the final payload in

819
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,559
that campaign was case rat

820
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,880
the exploit used was pulled from a

821
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,639
public approval concept post on github

822
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,120
and it was likely not developed

823
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,880
internally and this copy and pasting is

824
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,080
what originally gave this apd

825
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,679
its name of patchwork symmetria saw

826
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,240
a threat actor operating one of their

827
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,559
deception environments in 2016.

828
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,559
they were able to identify blurred

829
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,279
documents on a c2 server

830
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:00,000
and they all used chinese related alerts

831
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,679
or south china sea related lures

832
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,640
the tools all seem to be open source

833
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,200
tools available on github

834
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,840
so that again using those open source

835
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,880
tooling as part of their campaigns

836
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,480
and although that that was back in 2016

837
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,080
indian-based officers have not gone

838
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,080
anywhere um

839
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,918
earlier this year in may unit 42

840
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,039
released some reporting on hangover or

841
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,600
advisory tiger

842
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,158
uh in this activity uh targeted

843
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,879
government and military organizations

844
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,200
and worked extra hard to blend in as

845
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,640
impersonate legitimate services

846
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,320
include things like self-signed

847
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,919
certificates unique file descriptions

848
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,799
and convincing error messages

849
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,159
within the software the interesting

850
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,520
thing is that instead of using

851
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,279
phishing to directly deliver the

852
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,120
documents the actor actually hosted the

853
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,320
payloads on compromised third-party

854
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,918
websites

855
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,399
within the targeted countries tld

856
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,919
so in some ways even more interesting

857
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,239
than the state-sponsored activity is the

858
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,320
indian hacking for higher activity

859
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,159
two main names come to mind that have

860
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,360
been publicly reported the first is opt

861
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,880
in security

862
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,760
the second broker earlier this year and

863
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,440
is called dark basin by citizen lab

864
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,279
both operations target a variety of

865
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,559
individuals including attorneys

866
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,880
dissidents and journalists

867
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,918
the eff reported that operation manuel

868
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,399
which we talked about

869
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,880
earlier was in use by a variety of

870
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,199
individuals including kazakhstan

871
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,000
and the campaign that led to the

872
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,279
identification

873
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,880
of dark karakol in lebanon dark basin

874
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,399
allegedly has two different types of

875
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,840
campaigns the first seems to be

876
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,760
aggressive and annoying

877
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,480
forcing the user to click the link to

878
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,320
unsubscribe the second was more targeted

879
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,320
and masqueraded as legitimate service

880
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,720
asking for access to photo sharing

881
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,960
and that sort of thing if you're

882
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,880
interested in following indian apts and

883
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,760
and doing some more research

884
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,559
definitely suggest searching for hashtag

885
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,640
sidewinder

886
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,240
on twitter it'll get you a variety of

887
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,720
malware samples to look at from the

888
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,720
community

889
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:06,399
so next we have south korea the first

890
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,918
uh in november of 2019 a chinese

891
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,879
security company reported a pretty

892
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,919
unique campaign

893
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,039
uh that they identified as um active

894
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,720
since 2016 they called it hayasa

895
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,640
they used north korean related lures to

896
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,679
conduct their campaigns

897
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,679
and fished diplomatic

898
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,120
entities government officials expats and

899
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,000
traders

900
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,120
targets included china north korea japan

901
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,519
nepal

902
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,239
singapore russia switzerland and of

903
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,039
course

904
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,960
poland which is an interesting target

905
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,919
typically you don't necessarily see

906
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,919
poland being targeted

907
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,600
they often have the spear fishing often

908
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,360
happened on important holidays

909
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,879
and gave quote-unquote blessings during

910
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,120
those holidays

911
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,080
a unique thing about these this apt is

912
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,239
that they

913
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,600
weaponize newsletters as soon as four

914
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,960
days after the news happened so it was a

915
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,918
very quick time from uh

916
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,120
something being newsworthy to being in a

917
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,720
campaign

918
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,039
besides the typical trojan there was

919
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,559
also a key logger an outlook account

920
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,679
password stealer from github

921
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,000
and ghost rat as well

922
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,320
attribution came from a couple places

923
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,799
the first being timestamp analysis

924
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,519
which can always be faked but it just

925
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,918
takes some

926
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,080
extra work and then also

927
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:23,039
remnantsofnover.com

928
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:26,240
in the documents naver.com is south

929
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,120
korea's biggest search engine

930
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,480
so next we have dark hotel or shadow

931
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,199
crane that's probably one of my favorite

932
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,880
apts

933
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,519
uh in active since 2007 in 2014

934
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,159
kim's that are reported on uh hi

935
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,840
attacking

936
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,640
the hotel wi-fi against high-profile

937
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,639
vips

938
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,159
including us targeting of the defense

939
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,679
industrial base

940
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,919
any sector relating to investments in

941
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,399
economic development

942
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,080
targets include the us north korea japan

943
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,260
india bangladesh

944
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,600
thailand mozambique in germany um

945
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,279
[Music]

946
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,799
and so some actually interesting things

947
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,799
about this group

948
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,080
uh they'll start doing fishing with

949
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,918
monthly reports

950
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,840
um so you may not click on the first

951
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,080
fish in february with that report

952
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,439
but by late may you're used to seeing

953
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,120
those reports and you may click that

954
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,480
because hey if it comes every month

955
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,879
it can't be malicious right

956
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,559
um another interesting thing is that the

957
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,159
group configures their c2 to look like a

958
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,200
normal website if you visit the wrong

959
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,919
page

960
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,840
according to kaspersky they often show

961
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,440
pictures of artisanal ice cream

962
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:34,158
or comics unrelated to their target

963
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,960
this group has plenty of zero days

964
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,840
including

965
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,960
zero days internet explorer

966
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,879
vulnerabilities

967
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,320
interestingly some of those areas are

968
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,399
actually used against targets that

969
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,158
appear to be located in south korea

970
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,600
and at this time it's unclear whether

971
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,720
they belong to the multinational

972
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,399
companies

973
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,919
who are having to be operating south

974
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,120
korea or

975
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,720
domestic south korean citizens

976
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,639
it would be consistent with south korean

977
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,080
geopolitical aims to solicit information

978
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,000
from companies

979
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,600
that could be considered competitors so

980
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,640
that's the way i personally

981
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,120
lean on that but again some really cool

982
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,200
stuff

983
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,279
they also targeted the world health

984
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:16,239
organization earlier this year

985
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:19,839
um in relation to kobe 19.

986
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,959
so next we have some water buffalo from

987
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,960
vietnam

988
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,560
um so apt32 also known as ocean lotus

989
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,399
is a really unique set because with the

990
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,320
right visibility it's easy to see how

991
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,918
their campaigns align with vietnamese

992
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,520
state interests

993
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,440
nick carr formula fire i know with

994
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,000
microsoft has done a great job reporting

995
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,918
what fireeye had seen from this threat

996
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,159
since 2014 they have consistently

997
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,319
targeted foreign corporations

998
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,159
with manufacturing consumer products and

999
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,760
hospitality sectors

1000
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,159
they've also targeted vietnamese

1001
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,359
diaspora journalists and activists

1002
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,599
as well as government agencies

1003
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,040
what's interesting is that the targeting

1004
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,640
isn't just for straight intellectual

1005
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,440
property theft like a lot of intrusions

1006
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
are

1007
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,960
but rather they're serving the law

1008
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,720
enforcement audit purpose

1009
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,280
the best example of this would be the

1010
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,799
automobile industry where

1011
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,160
vietnam vietnam excuse me vietnam

1012
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,440
implemented strict regulations for

1013
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,960
importing cars

1014
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,359
following those laws multiple car

1015
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,440
manufacturers including toyota and bmw

1016
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,720
were attacked in late 2018 by ocean

1017
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,720
lotus

1018
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,399
and these attacks happened quicker than

1019
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,118
the meeting notes sometimes got out from

1020
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,119
those new bus

1021
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
we talked about how ocean lotus conducts

1022
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,400
operations against typical targets for

1023
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,680
a government-sponsored adversary these

1024
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,720
include operations against other

1025
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,799
government agencies

1026
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,560
most located regionally according to the

1027
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,680
eff they've also been known to target

1028
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,000
journalists

1029
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:48,399
and activists ocean laws actually

1030
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,400
transcripts between the philippine

1031
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,320
president duarte

1032
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,000
with world leaders both the president

1033
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,000
united states and the chinese president

1034
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,760
so another uh threat actor with

1035
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,759
ties to vietnam and some overlap with

1036
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,440
ocean lotus is phantom lance

1037
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,520
first publicly reported in spring of

1038
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,520
2020 kaspersky estimated they've been

1039
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,280
active since around 2016.

1040
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,800
they primarily conducted attacks using

1041
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,320
mobile malware

1042
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,079
the first version that they submit to

1043
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,040
the store is clean with no malicious

1044
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,960
code

1045
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,359
but later updates then contain malicious

1046
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,680
code and payload to make it past

1047
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,960
the screening this allows them to

1048
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,680
successfully enter that

1049
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,200
the app store targeting information is

1050
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,078
consistent with vietnamese state

1051
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,720
interest

1052
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,440
in southeast asia majority happen to be

1053
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,240
in india

1054
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,160
bangladesh vietnam indonesia nepal

1055
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:43,279
myanmar and malaysia

1056
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,279
so next we have machete possibly

1057
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,359
colombia or venezuela attribution

1058
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,119
they've been active since 2010

1059
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,400
revamped in 2012 they're

1060
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,119
spanish-speaking

1061
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,640
apt and they're looking for photos from

1062
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,359
webcams geolocation

1063
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,078
audio from microphones targeting

1064
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,640
includes

1065
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,119
venezuela colombia and ecuador along

1066
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,440
with russia so you're seeing

1067
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,040
both whether whether they're based out

1068
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,520
of colombia or venezuela you're seeing

1069
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,400
both domestic and foreign targeting

1070
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,280
by this group which i think does not get

1071
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,640
as much attention

1072
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,960
as some of the other ones

1073
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,319
all right so what so we've talked a lot

1074
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,680
about different adversaries

1075
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,079
a lot of content so first off let's talk

1076
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,839
trends it's evident that smaller

1077
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,839
governments have no problem using these

1078
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,359
targeted attacks against dissidents

1079
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,880
journalists and sometimes even their own

1080
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,960
citizens

1081
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,240
if you have employees or friends in

1082
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,520
these groups please make sure they're

1083
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,959
protected

1084
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,720
the google advanced protection program

1085
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,440
is now free for everyone get a hardware

1086
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,240
token

1087
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,480
get to work protecting yourselves as

1088
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,160
defenses

1089
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,280
if you're a multinational company when

1090
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,160
was the last time that you threat

1091
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,280
modeled

1092
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,480
the local gov governments or the

1093
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,880
the governments that may affect your

1094
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,400
local subsidiaries uh your businesses do

1095
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,599
you conduct work in a place that may

1096
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,839
conduct cyber operations against you

1097
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,200
a couple suggestions would be have you

1098
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,920
read reporting from companies that are

1099
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,399
doing work

1100
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,920
specifically in those regions a lot of

1101
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,079
times their reporting is unique and is

1102
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,839
quicker than some of the larger players

1103
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,240
i personally am a fan of getting outside

1104
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,440
of just the american infosec bubble

1105
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,680
and getting intelligence from um

1106
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,800
other places because i think that allows

1107
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,160
us to a better

1108
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,720
fuller picture of what the threat

1109
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,118
landscape actually looks like

1110
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,200
um and if you've seen have you seen with

1111
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,520
unique regional targeting

1112
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,680
i think if you have and you're able to

1113
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,400
share some ttps and trends that you've

1114
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,200
seen

1115
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,680
that will help everyone um understand

1116
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,279
the

1117
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,720
the landscape better and understand the

1118
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,400
threat better

1119
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,000
red team hopefully you saw some

1120
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,480
interesting things to make yourself look

1121
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,920
more like actual adversaries and not

1122
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,520
just trying to get the latest

1123
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,320
exploit to work and again i'll please

1124
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,599
share the information that you see i

1125
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,110
think it's really great to

1126
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,400
to share across the industry

1127
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:05,119

1139
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,119
if you if you have a specific adversary

1140
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,440
go

1141
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,160
