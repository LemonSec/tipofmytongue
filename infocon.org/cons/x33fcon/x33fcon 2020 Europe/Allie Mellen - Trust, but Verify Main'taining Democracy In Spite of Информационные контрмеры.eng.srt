1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,480
hi everyone welcome to

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,759
trust but verify maintaining democracy

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,800
in spite of information countermeasures

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,279
i'm ali mellon i'm a security strategist

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,160
in the office of the cso at cyber reason

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,279
and for the past three years i've been

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,359
working with

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,720
federal and state law enforcement

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,399
including the fbi

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,760
dhs sysa and others

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,920
in order to figure out how we can

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,960
improve our processes around

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,360
elections and

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,719
a big part of that has been not so much

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,719
what's happening with the

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,960
voting machines themselves but

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,800
everything around the voting machines

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,239
everything around election day whether

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,640
it's weeks before

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,000
or the day of we're thinking about

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,680
things like

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,080
disinformation how people can

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,080
cause a traffic jam the day of if

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,158
there's an attack on the electric grid

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,240
things like that and so what we're going

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,920
to start talking about in this talk

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,839
is all of those different things and

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,840
hopefully get you guys brainstorming

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,880
different ways that you could both

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,880
attack and

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,880
of course defend an election

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,758
so i want to take a step back and start

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,200
by talking about

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,520
what's truly critical to our daily lives

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,799
because this is way more related to

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,720
voting than people

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,479
really think and the way that i like to

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,240
categorize this is through maslow's

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,799
hierarchy of needs

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,920
as we know this includes physiological

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,880
needs at the base

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,240
things like air and water and food and

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,320
as we work our way up

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,839
we're seeing things like safety personal

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,960
security employment

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,600
all of these things that are really

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,199
important so that we as human beings

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,679
can have a life

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,240
and of course the next step in the

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,880
pyramid

51
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,199
is that friendship and intimacy this

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,359
sense of connection

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,319
and then esteem which is either

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,280
self-esteem

55
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,280
or self-respect or the respect of others

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,760
things like status and recognition

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,800
and this is all leading towards the top

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,879
of the pyramid

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,480
which is self-actualization and the

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,280
desire to become

61
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,079
the most that one can be and the

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,800
question that i

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,440
want you guys to be thinking about is

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,720
where does voting fit into this

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,840
what does it mean to be able

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,680
and be enabled to go out and vote and

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,680
how does that affect your daily life

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,079
so that's what we're talking about first

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,120
we'll dive into the defender perspective

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,120
and really see the state of play today

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,120
then we'll go into the daily life of a

72
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,319
vote what that looks like

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,640
and jump into the attacker perspective

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,679
trying to identify different ways an

75
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,760
attacker

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,959
might use election day to their

77
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,040
advantage

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,640
then we'll get into what you could do to

79
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,480
actually stop an election

80
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,559
as well as how we can use this

81
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,079
information to protect our elections

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
because that's the whole point of this

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,800
talk

84
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,000
is not about just attacking an election

85
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,840
but really about

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
making the effort to defend it

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,040
so let's talk about that defender

88
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,839
perspective

89
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,720
according to the dhs election

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,760
infrastructure

91
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,319
is defined as the voter registration

92
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,000
databases the voting systems

93
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:41,040
anything surrounding voting equipment

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,040
it's a very narrow definition that

95
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,079
really does just include that it

96
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,920
infrastructure

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,080
that we traditionally think of and

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,000
traditionally test as well

99
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,400
you'll see at events like defcon and

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,280
others with voting villages a lot of it

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,120
is around

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,480
testing the actual voting equipment but

103
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,799
my question is is that all and

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,560
through the course of these exercises

105
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,360
what i've learned is that that is really

106
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,959
not all

107
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,640
there is much more to voting

108
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,840
and protecting voting than solely

109
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,279
the actual election equipment

110
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,840
that the government is either producing

111
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,239
or is being manufactured by someone

112
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,880
and i think of this through what i call

113
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,000
the voter hierarchy of needs

114
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,639
and actually each level of this

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,320
is in some way linked back to maslow's

116
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,000
hierarchy of needs

117
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,680
but in order to convey the things that

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,400
we really need

119
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,800
before we truly feel comfortable and

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,840
feel

121
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,520
safe enough to go vote and motivated

122
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,000
enough

123
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,359
so we're starting with things like the

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,560
physiological needs

125
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,440
if you fear for your life or for your

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,199
property

127
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,880
you're pretty unlikely to go vote

128
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,560
because you have priorities

129
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,320
that outrank those of actually going to

130
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,320
vote

131
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,919
similarly safety comes into play whether

132
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,919
it's your personal safety

133
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,880
your family safety safety with your job

134
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,880
all of these things can at times be more

135
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,520
important than going out to vote on that

136
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,120
one election day

137
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,919
belonging also comes into play if you

138
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,280
are not feeling like you belong in the

139
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,599
country that you are in

140
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,039
or if you don't feel like you're a part

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
of the community

142
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,719
you're much less likely to go out and

143
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,160
vote because it doesn't seem to matter

144
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,600
as much to you it

145
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,800
the direction of the country you don't

146
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,320
feel personally invested in that

147
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,880
and then of course esteem things like

148
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,960
if you don't feel that your vote matters

149
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,360
which at least in the united states a

150
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,680
lot of people do feel that way

151
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:55,280
then you are much less likely to go vote

152
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,199
and ultimately self-actualization

153
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,280
both being the best person that you can

154
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,840
be and also

155
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,880
making sure that you are contributing to

156
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,440
the best country

157
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,159
that you can have all of these

158
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,479
components

159
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,160
are so critical to actually making sure

160
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,520
that someone goes out and votes

161
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,840
and it's very um

162
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,599
it can be very challenging for everyone

163
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,599
to have all of these needs met

164
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
and feel comfortable voting on a regular

165
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,680
day

166
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,960
so that's the complete hierarchy of

167
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,319
needs

168
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,120
but um what that really is making me

169
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,440
think about

170
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,720
is when you're thinking about election

171
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,759
infrastructure

172
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,720
and you think about all of the things

173
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,400
that voters need in order to actually

174
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,800
make it to the polls and actually go

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,000
vote

176
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,440
feel like their vote matters it really

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,680
challenges this idea

178
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,039
that that's all there is to election

179
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,639
infrastructure

180
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,159
and all of these systems that we are now

181
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,759
supposed to protect

182
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,080
in order to make sure that people feel

183
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,360
safe and motivated to vote

184
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,080
become a target and become a huge target

185
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,880
because if you

186
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,719
take out any of these layers you are

187
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,199
affecting someone's ability

188
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,840
and will to go vote depending on the

189
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,800
scenario

190
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,520
and in a nation like the u.s 40 percent

191
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,880
of eligible

192
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,318
citizens don't vote at all any kind of

193
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,919
voter suppression

194
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,720
has an impact on the election any

195
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,599
and so if you even attack one of these

196
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,160
layers

197
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,639
a little bit you are likely to affect

198
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,639
the vote

199
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,680
so there are other elements of election

200
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,880
infrastructure that we really need to

201
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,240
consider

202
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,880
things like those that will affect voter

203
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,319
suppression

204
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,719
things that will affect your faith in

205
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,240
the government and other factors related

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,879
to that

207
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,440
there are ways to influence an election

208
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,599
beyond actually changing the voter rolls

209
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,759
and voter suppression is an attack on

210
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,520
democracy

211
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,919
especially when perpetrated by a foreign

212
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,799
government

213
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,599
so now i want to jump into the attacker

214
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,560
perspective

215
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,680
and as people in the information

216
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,840
security industry

217
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,240
we know that red teaming isn't evil

218
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,599
that it's really important to consider

219
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,520
the attacker perspective

220
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,280
so that you can bring your best defense

221
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,799
that you can be the most prepared

222
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,719
but it's really important to call that

223
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,479
out because especially when it comes to

224
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,720
these political issues

225
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:33,120
they can feel very um charged

226
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,560
and it can seem like a really bad thing

227
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,279
if you're going in and you're trying to

228
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,478
effect

229
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,479
to test what would affect an election

230
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,800
but this is all just to make us better

231
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,360
and to just to make us more prepared

232
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,640
and to be considering more aspects of

233
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,720
election security

234
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,480
so with that in mind let's jump in

235
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,000
in a lot of cases especially when we're

236
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,800
dealing with nation states

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,640
what we're seeing is they are looking to

238
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,760
do three main things the first

239
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,880
is of course to gain power the second

240
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,760
is to spread a particular ideology

241
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,640
and the third is to maintain that global

242
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,959
recognition

243
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,880
and support that they may already have

244
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,560
we've seen this time and time again

245
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,880
throughout history not just with

246
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,239
elections but even more generally

247
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,160
nations try to raise their power

248
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,560
to a superpower level or to maintain

249
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,800
their superpower level or to spread

250
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,800
whatever belief system that they hold

251
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,399
and in order to do that what we're

252
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,479
seeing

253
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,880
is that they can target three different

254
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,920
layers and i talk about these as the

255
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,920
infrastructure layer

256
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,040
the information layer and the ethos

257
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,680
layer

258
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,519
now we're going to start by looking at

259
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,760
some examples

260
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,160
from that ethos plane and that ethos

261
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,480
plane is really about the belief system

262
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,680
attacks that are really targeting how

263
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,560
people feel

264
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,560
what their beliefs are and really trying

265
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,160
to affect that and i want to jump into

266
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,839
some historical examples

267
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,160
and some present day examples and

268
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,839
potential things that could happen

269
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,439
keep in mind that not all of these are

270
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,640
even going to be election related

271
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,760
directly

272
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,199
but they give a great example of how one

273
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,279
could use these tactics

274
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,000
on election day or how they could

275
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,959
effect in a vote a vote like months or

276
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
years later

277
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,920
just with these tactics

278
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,320
so let's start with the italian

279
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,360
elections of 1948.

280
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,000
this was a case of election interference

281
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,160
on both

282
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,920
sides the u.s government was intent on

283
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,959
psychological warfare

284
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,560
and pushing democracy and millions of

285
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,399
dollars was going to christian

286
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,359
democratic and right-wing socialist

287
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,839
parties

288
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,680
this was a massive propaganda campaign

289
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,440
between the soviet union and

290
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,239
the united states where it was

291
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,839
communism versus democracy socialism

292
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,279
versus democracy

293
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,480
and what they were able to do just in

294
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,680
italy

295
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,200
is to ultimately change the perception

296
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,319
of that election

297
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,360
to democracy versus totalitarianism

298
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,160
to christianity versus atheism

299
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,560
to america versus the soviet union and

300
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,880
to

301
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,279
abundance versus starvation all through

302
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,600
this propaganda

303
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,240
and the united states found this to be

304
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,680
so successful

305
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,519
that they repeated this process in

306
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,519
guatemala

307
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:38,240
in south vietnam in afghanistan

308
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:41,600
and indonesia and many many more

309
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,600
so this is one example of something that

310
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,519
just through propaganda which at the

311
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,480
time was not using the internet

312
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,760
obviously because it was so long ago was

313
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,000
able to influence

314
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,000
an election and able to influence

315
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
multiple elections

316
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,279
and what's so fascinating about this is

317
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,399
now we have an even

318
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:03,200
easier way to communicate these things

319
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,160
to a group of individuals to a country

320
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,160
thanks to the internet

321
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,600
another example is um from moscow

322
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,639
where they were urging the american

323
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,440
communist party

324
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,279
to pursue revolutionary regime regime

325
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,839
change in the united states

326
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,680
it was the equivalent of the democracy

327
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,399
promotion that was later pursued by

328
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,399
washington

329
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,279
and then of course there's the 1996

330
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,920
chinese influence on the us election

331
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,560
now this is both this is a multifaceted

332
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,839
attack

333
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,719
on our democracy but needless to say 300

334
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,320
000

335
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,000
was sent from a chinese general

336
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,519
interested in influencing the u.s

337
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,839
presidential election they were trying

338
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,040
to funnel money to the clinton campaign

339
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,320
so this had immediate um physical

340
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,160
impact and it also had an attack

341
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,320
that was meant to impact the belief

342
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,040
system because all of a sudden

343
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,920
americans were aware of a situation in

344
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,760
which

345
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,240
their politicians were being bought off

346
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,319
by foreign um

347
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,720
generals and foreign people of foreign

348
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,720
influence

349
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,519
now let's look at some present day

350
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,880
attacks that we've seen that are

351
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,880
specifically

352
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,079
meant to affect an outcome of the

353
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,120
election we're going to talk a lot about

354
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,439
the 2016

355
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,079
u.s presidential election in this we'll

356
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,200
start with social media influence

357
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:30,479
so on the right you can see an example

358
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,040
of a facebook advertisement

359
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,360
that was put on by people in a different

360
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,399
country and is meant to push this

361
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,040
image of divisiveness in the u.s and

362
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,040
make people

363
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,880
actively think that there's this

364
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,599
conflict going on whether or not there

365
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,680
truly is

366
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:51,440
and of course in some cases there is but

367
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,399
the extent of it is amplified

368
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,360
by this country pushing this message and

369
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,839
then on the left

370
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,800
you can see an example from twitter that

371
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,120
is both an

372
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,800
ethos attack and an information attack

373
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,760
it's telling people

374
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,279
that they can vote from home by texting

375
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,519
their vote

376
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,560
and of course this is not actually

377
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,199
possible

378
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,199
at least in the united states but with a

379
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,719
year like this one with the pandemic and

380
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,240
everything going on

381
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,920
something like this might seem quite

382
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,440
appetizing to people who don't

383
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,599
want to go wait in line at a polling

384
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,480
place or don't understand the rules of

385
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,920
mainland voting

386
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,639
and just want to get it out of the way

387
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,639
really easily

388
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,880
now we're also seeing i'd be really

389
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,360
remiss

390
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,040
to not talk about um disinformation

391
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,040
campaigns that are happening and

392
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,279
what's important to think about here is

393
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,920
that we have a lot of

394
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,839
social media companies who are either

395
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,639
unwilling or have been unwilling in the

396
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,160
past

397
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,160
to take into account

398
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,120
election security and the importance of

399
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,639
maintaining integrity in elections

400
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,120
into their platforms and

401
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,079
i think that this is where i started to

402
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,440
really realize

403
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,479
that is not just the government's job to

404
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,360
protect our elections it is also the job

405
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,680
of those

406
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,199
individuals in those countries that have

407
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,560
these businesses that have so much

408
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,120
influence

409
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:24,479
and so quotes like these

410
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,120
are a cop-out in order to

411
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,639
make this company seem like they're

412
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,680
doing an okay job

413
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,320
but in reality it is everyone's job

414
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,880
to help protect the institutions that we

415
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,600
believe in

416
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,980
and that we value whether or not those

417
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,839
um institutions are democracy

418
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,000
[Music]

419
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,880
now let's take a look at the information

420
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,600
plan

421
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,120
this is things that are more directly

422
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,079
related to disinformation

423
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,839
things that are all about what people

424
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,638
actually think is the truth and what

425
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,680
people see

426
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,600
and perceive as their reality

427
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,279
and i want to start with a really

428
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,399
interesting example

429
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:09,120
that um i certainly didn't know about

430
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,839
before doing all of this work which is

431
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,839
the foundations of the united states

432
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,920
and what's fascinating about this is

433
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,079
that america was actually founded

434
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,839
on the premise of a conspiracy theory

435
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,560
where the british were trying to

436
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,399
enslave us sam adams argued that

437
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,839
britain's taxations were part of an

438
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,160
elaborate conspiracy

439
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:33,040
to ultimately enslave american colonists

440
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,319
he spread that information and other

441
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,959
early disinformation

442
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,639
through pamphlets and speeches that had

443
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,079
information that he knew was completely

444
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,199
not true

445
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,758
and he also used the boston massacre

446
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,079
to further this he actually handed out

447
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,399
pamphlets with disinformation in them

448
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,319
this is a very early example of the

449
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,199
disinformation campaigns that we see

450
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,600
today

451
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,680
just in a different format and this was

452
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,160
actually the foundations of america

453
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,719
which

454
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,079
as we all know is one of the countries

455
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,839
that's truly struggling with this

456
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,839
information at this point in time

457
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,520
next up is a story i actually really

458
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,000
love um

459
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,199
that's fascinating about the cia and the

460
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
propaganda asset

461
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,000
inventory so of course in the 1950s and

462
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
60s during the cold war era

463
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,439
the cia was spreading a lot of

464
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,240
propaganda um

465
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,280
in order to further the u.s message a

466
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,960
lot of countries were

467
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,720
truthfully but in this case um

468
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,720
a couple of the formats that they were

469
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,840
doing it in was for example

470
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,120
radio free asia and what they realized

471
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,280
is that they wanted to

472
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,678
affect the sentiment of people in taiwan

473
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,799
but they realized that people in taiwan

474
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,559
private citizens

475
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,360
most likely did not have access to a

476
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,720
radio because it was so early on

477
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:57,039
and so they tied radios two balloons

478
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,640
and tried to fly them over to taiwan

479
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,160
needless to say the wind changed and

480
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,360
took them into different direction

481
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,080
but it was still a fascinating instance

482
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,760
of how

483
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,760
they're really trying to figure out ways

484
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,559
to combine that infrastructure

485
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,960
and um information plane to spread

486
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,879
disinformation or propaganda or whatever

487
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,960
you want to call it

488
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,919
another example that's really

489
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,960
interesting is

490
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:24,160
a magazine that the cia used to publish

491
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,280
fake stories in this was called forum

492
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,679
world features

493
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,480
and the magazine actually became so

494
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,200
popular

495
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,240
that it started to be distributed in the

496
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,880
u.s

497
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,240
and so the cia had to be very careful to

498
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,120
make sure that they weren't placing

499
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,760
false stories

500
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,840
in the u.s version which to me is like

501
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,919
horrifying

502
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,399
but some very interesting examples of

503
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,600
the

504
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,160
the problems that they ran into um and

505
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,240
also

506
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,440
the ways and the methods that they used

507
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,320
very early on

508
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,480
in order to spread this propaganda

509
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,559
and of course hardly a left-wing

510
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,880
newspaper in europe wasn't financed

511
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,440
directly by moscow in the 50s 60s and

512
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,440
70s

513
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,480
similarly in the late 1970s and early

514
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,000
1980s

515
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,360
we saw u.s radio broadcasting in russia

516
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,600
and in moscow

517
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,199
that was all rock music lots of elton

518
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,199
john lots of the beatles

519
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,960
this was stuff that russians couldn't

520
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,679
get anywhere else

521
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,520
but it was often followed by quote

522
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,600
unquote editorial content

523
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,480
which soviet authorities considered

524
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,480
disinformation

525
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,360
so this is an example more recent

526
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,400
example

527
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,320
um that specifically does talk about a

528
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,520
ukrainian election

529
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,399
and what's fascinating about this is

530
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,440
that several days before the ukrainian

531
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,600
election

532
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,080
they were attackers were able to

533
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,600
compromise the cec network and disable

534
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,320
vote counting

535
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,000
this automatically results in people

536
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,158
losing faith in their government

537
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,520
of course but then on election day they

538
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,720
followed it up this was

539
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,799
four days later may 25th 2014.

540
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,559
um that attackers followed it up with a

541
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,679
constant denial of service attack

542
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,720
on that same cec website

543
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,440
12 minutes before the polls closed the

544
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,880
attackers

545
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,200
posted a picture of dmitry yarash

546
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,480
the former leader of the right sector on

547
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,480
the cec website

548
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,000
claiming that he won the election and

549
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,000
then just like that

550
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
it was shared by russian media

551
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,640
immediately

552
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,760
this was meant to cause confusion make

553
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,240
people believe

554
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,360
that someone had one who potentially had

555
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,080
not

556
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,559
and um generally to make people lose

557
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,320
faith

558
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,360
in their government's websites and

559
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,320
whether they could trust their

560
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,320
government's websites

561
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,840
now let's look at some examples of

562
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,440
communication

563
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,399
attacks that happened especially in this

564
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,000
last election

565
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,480
in the u.s we'll start um on the right

566
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,159
which is an example where a text message

567
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,679
was sent to a voter saying

568
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,559
here's your polling location here are

569
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,400
the times you can go only problem is

570
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,559
this is not a text message from the

571
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,080
government this is actually a test

572
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,918
text message from an attacker and

573
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,639
there's no polling location

574
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,400
where they listed a location so they're

575
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,360
intentionally sending someone to the

576
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,960
wrong address

577
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:34,080
because ultimately if you see this text

578
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,039
you see what you suspect is your polling

579
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,280
location

580
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,720
you're probably going to try to go there

581
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,799
and if you get there

582
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,240
and it's not actually a polling location

583
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,559
one you're going to be confused

584
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,280
and two you'll be much more likely to

585
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,520
not

586
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,200
try to find this magical polling

587
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,120
location that you now have no idea where

588
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,760
it is

589
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,479
and then on the left you can see a

590
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,559
message

591
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,520
claiming to be from president trump is

592
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,600
not

593
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,520
that's shaming this person into

594
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,158
submitting their vote

595
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,200
so that's intentionally meant to push

596
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,280
people to vote

597
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,120
even when perhaps it's not something

598
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,200
that they've done or they have done it

599
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,840
or they haven't voted for trump whatever

600
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,840
the case may be

601
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,280
and lastly and i think most

602
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,760
interestingly

603
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,280
um although in many is very sad we're

604
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,799
going to talk about the infrastructure

605
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,918
plane and again

606
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,240
starting out with some of those

607
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,120
historical examples that

608
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,880
don't have a cyber component but could

609
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,399
easily have one

610
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,000
given the current state of play

611
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,240
so we're going to start with the

612
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,440
assassination of lumumba

613
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,799
he um was the prime minister of the

614
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,080
um democratic republic of congo

615
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,400
and he was actually assassinated in 1961

616
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,439
and while this may not seem directly

617
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,880
related

618
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:58,400
he was actually elected in 1960

619
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,400
which was when the drc actually had

620
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,520
first gained independence

621
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,240
so their first pm is

622
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,200
assassinated a year after being in

623
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,159
office

624
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,400
and it turns out that the people who

625
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,600
assassinated him were actually

626
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,520
a cohort of american and belgian

627
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,678
individuals associated with governments

628
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,039
there

629
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,159
for a brand new nation to be attacked in

630
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,760
this way

631
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:31,679
by two large countries

632
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,400
and is like completely politically

633
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,520
fracturing

634
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,480
for this independent nation and

635
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,600
is can cause a lot of strife because

636
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,200
most likely

637
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,120
if you see your prime minister

638
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,080
assassinated after your first year of

639
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,360
independence

640
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,199
you're not gonna have much faith in the

641
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,639
government and you're not gonna have

642
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,559
much faith if the people

643
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,000
people you elect are even going to be

644
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,039
allowed to live

645
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,039
by other governments

646
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,760
another horrifying and very good example

647
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,799
of this

648
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,240
is with the indonesian elections

649
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:08,158
this was in 1965 and the communist party

650
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,679
had finished fourth in an indonesian

651
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,039
election

652
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,760
they were offered proportional

653
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,559
representation in the government

654
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,720
and the united states secretly supported

655
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,678
the purge of suspected communists

656
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,880
because it wasn't

657
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,200
in their interests in western interests

658
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,480
and so thousands to millions they're not

659
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,200
really sure the total

660
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,000
count died over the course of months and

661
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,720
the military

662
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,919
military took over as the most powerful

663
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,840
institution

664
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,679
and so this is the type of thing that

665
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,320
obviously it has an immediate impact

666
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,559
because

667
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,840
a huge portion of the population is just

668
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,960
wiped out

669
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,199
but it also terrifies the public

670
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,120
i would not want to speak freely about

671
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,760
my point of view

672
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,399
i would not want to or feel safe going

673
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,039
to vote

674
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,000
because again you have a superpower that

675
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,600
is

676
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,919
attacking your institution in order

677
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,879
to make sure that they have things their

678
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,159
way

679
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,559
and these are the type of things that

680
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,600
can really destroy people's faith in

681
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,158
their government

682
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,678
and really destroy their beliefs that

683
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,600
their vote even matters

684
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,610
and that what they want to do even

685
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,520
matters

686
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:19,600

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,799
and though this one again is not an

688
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,559
election day attack

689
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,720
it's a really good representation of

690
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,840
what could happen and it does have that

691
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,039
cyber component

692
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:32,720
so in 2007 um

693
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,640
there was this group in estonia

694
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,080
that decided they were going to move a

695
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,480
red army soldier

696
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,678
out of the center of estonia and into a

697
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,039
soviet cemetery

698
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,400
this was a government and immediately as

699
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,440
they were doing this

700
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,480
fake news started to spread with russian

701
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,960
news reports

702
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,559
that they were destroying the statue and

703
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,480
they were also

704
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,039
desecrating some graves and destroying

705
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,240
some soviet graves

706
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,799
um this fake

707
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,440
information resulted in two nights of

708
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,918
riots and looting

709
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:11,279
156 people were injured one person died

710
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:14,720
a thousand people were detained

711
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:18,080
but the really interesting part

712
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,320
is that at the same time

713
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,840
the attackers were perpetrating an

714
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,000
infrastructure attack

715
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,240
they were having giving a denial of

716
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,960
service attack to banks media outlets

717
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,080
and governments so that people could not

718
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,640
take machines

719
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,918
to cash out of atms they couldn't do any

720
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,600
online banking

721
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,279
government employees were unable to

722
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,439
communicate through email

723
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,120
and newspapers and broadcasters could

724
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,840
not deliver the news

725
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,320
so they were able to consistently spread

726
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,360
this

727
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,799
misinformation through russian news

728
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,039
reports

729
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,960
the estonians could not report on the

730
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,760
news and they could not actually

731
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,799
communicate

732
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,720
between each other to help calm down

733
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,720
some of the rioting and looting

734
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,400
and this is a great quote about that

735
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,520
night

736
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,760
that shows that cyber is

737
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,000
really just meant to it's a tool to

738
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,559
spread confusion it's a tool to prevent

739
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,600
us

740
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,120
from calming people down and from making

741
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,439
sure that everyone is heard

742
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,678
and seen but not necessarily getting to

743
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,120
the point of actual violence

744
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:30,399
but what's amazing is that through these

745
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,360
little activities you can really result

746
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,439
in some severe

747
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,918
damage and potential violence

748
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,480
so let's look at some potential with the

749
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,039
electric grid

750
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,640
in 2003 a four-day power outage left at

751
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,640
least a hundred people

752
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,760
in the us and canada dead now

753
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,399
this when

754
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,840
electric um when the electric grid goes

755
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,959
down it can seem like a minor

756
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,320
inconvenience

757
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,600
but it can actually leave people dead

758
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,840
unfortunately and if an attacker was

759
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,879
able to attack the electric grid

760
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,559
they could not only stop a person from

761
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,080
feeling motivated to vote because you're

762
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,360
going to be more focused on

763
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,279
what in your fridge is going bad and um

764
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,399
whatever you need power for that you no

765
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,760
longer have it

766
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:25,120
but they can also cause division

767
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,720
by say targeting specific regions of the

768
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,120
country that they know

769
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,399
lean one way politically and making

770
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,639
people feel

771
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,199
like this is not just an attack on the

772
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,399
country it's an attack on one specific

773
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,399
group within the country

774
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,000
i also want to talk about transit

775
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,000
because transit

776
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,039
is really really key when it comes to

777
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,440
voting

778
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,520
in 2016 san francisco's transit system

779
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,840
was infected with ransomware

780
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,760
and this is a great example where a lot

781
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,158
of people go to vote after work

782
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,600
and before pre-pandemic a lot of people

783
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,679
took the train into work

784
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,719
so say i'm taking the train into work

785
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,600
one day

786
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,600
i'm on my phone most likely seeing and

787
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,399
or reading some type of disinformation

788
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,480
on twitter

789
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:12,799
by accident and i make it through my day

790
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,760
and i tell myself i'm going to go vote

791
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,840
after work

792
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,919
so i get done with work i go to take the

793
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,240
train but i can't take the train

794
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,760
it's shut down what do you do in this

795
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,600
scenario

796
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,960
because a lot of people would be much

797
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,360
more inclined to think

798
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,399
ugh now i have to find my way home

799
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,120
instead of uh

800
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,559
now i have to find my way home and out

801
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,559
to vote

802
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,799
so it's just something to consider that

803
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,879
all of these roadblocks

804
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,760
lead to people being less motivated to

805
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,799
vote

806
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,720
and we can see that we have

807
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,559
attacks that are not only across all of

808
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,200
these layers but across

809
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,200
all of the layers of the pyramid as well

810
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,320
so let's dive into the defender

811
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,479
perspective so we can really talk about

812
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,480
these attacks in the context of

813
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,679
what processes we can make and how we

814
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,120
can actually defend against them

815
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,480
where does all of this lead us and when

816
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,039
we think about this

817
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,039
right now we have this very narrow

818
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,200
definition of election security

819
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,559
all about election infrastructure again

820
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,279
the voter rolls

821
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,240
the it infrastructure around that and

822
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,000
what we've seen

823
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:29,360
is it's led to comments like this

824
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,600
from um high up people in

825
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,479
multiple governments we can't exclude

826
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,480
such attack

827
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,880
activities in germany either which

828
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,240
just saying that without any context

829
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,080
without any

830
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:47,679
um reference to support like to help

831
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,360
the people actually not fall for these

832
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,480
fake stories in this distr these

833
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,840
distortions

834
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,279
is really um it just makes people

835
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,039
feel like there's no hope in the

836
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,080
situation which is not the way that you

837
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,320
want to feel about

838
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,279
your government's ability to protect you

839
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,360
and to protect

840
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:08,640
your institutions similarly

841
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,678
we see presidents and leaders of

842
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,840
countries

843
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,919
calling um elections a scam

844
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,879
which has a huge impact on people's

845
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,720
belief

846
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,919
that their government is truly giving

847
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,600
them the opportunities

848
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,760
that they deserve and even

849
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,439
with talk congressional democrats

850
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,640
specifically saying

851
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,480
that this is a threat which i think is

852
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,039
great that we're calling it out

853
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,679
but we need something to say here's what

854
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,480
you can do

855
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,760
to help stop it because just calling it

856
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,679
out on its own

857
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,679
is just going to um

858
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,120
affect people's beliefs in their

859
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,200
institutions more

860
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,699
and not actually offer a solution that

861
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,360
brings people together

862
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,679
[Music]

863
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,439
and that brings me to my point of where

864
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,399
should we actually be going because we

865
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,519
have

866
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:04,239
this problem but we're not

867
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,279
meeting the problem with a strong

868
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,799
solution

869
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:12,000
by limiting our definition of um

870
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:15,120
election security so much what we really

871
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,360
need is a more comprehensive definition

872
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,399
that talks about things like

873
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,639
communications

874
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,760
and social media and transit the

875
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,120
electric grid

876
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,200
other things that i haven't even

877
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,320
considered here and that i'm hoping you

878
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,159
guys are going to consider

879
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,559
and really think about in your daily

880
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,200
lives

881
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,480
and so in order to get there i want you

882
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,240
guys to think about

883
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,320
what your election day looks like do you

884
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,039
vote before work do you mail in your

885
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,120
ballot

886
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,399
i know i'm mailing in my ballot because

887
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,918
i don't want to deal

888
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:48,639
with the polling place during a pandemic

889
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,679
normally i would vote before work but

890
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,919
how do modern

891
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,080
events change how you choose to vote are

892
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,880
you tracking your mail-in ballot

893
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,600
um are you on twitter and do you fact

894
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,600
check the messages that you see there

895
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,120
these are all really important questions

896
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,480
and it's about

897
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,439
it's a grind it's about every day making

898
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,919
sure that you

899
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,640
are moving up that pyramid towards

900
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,720
self-actualization towards being the

901
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,799
best you can be towards taking in

902
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,799
the information that is factual and true

903
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,879
so with all of that in mind how would

904
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,200
you

905
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,480
attack an election and if you can think

906
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,919
about this

907
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,519
what would you do to actually impact an

908
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,120
election would you attack an electric

909
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,679
grid

910
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,239
would you attack the transit system

911
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,799
would you

912
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,480
release a deep fake of a candidate

913
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:44,000
saying something that they didn't say

914
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,840
or just editing a video

915
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,600
um in order to make it sound like a

916
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,959
candidate says something but it's

917
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,959
wildly out of context and what could you

918
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,039
do and how would you attack when you had

919
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,240
a whole government behind you to support

920
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,158
you a whole nation state

921
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,840
these are the questions that we need to

922
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,640
be asking ourselves now so we're

923
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,639
prepared later

924
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,918
and use that information

925
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,440
to think about what you can do to help

926
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,239
defend

927
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,240
your country

928
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,679
so the question

929
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,000
that this leaves us with is what can we

930
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,240
do

931
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,800
to protect democracy what can we do to

932
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,359
protect whatever institution we are a

933
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,800
part of

934
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,679
in our country and the key to that

935
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,399
regardless

936
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,359
of whether you're in a democracy or not

937
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,839
is to

938
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,960
secure your systems whether or not

939
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,918
you're in the government

940
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,119
or not because as we saw with a lot of

941
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,359
these methods

942
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,560
they use equipment that is not

943
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,279
controlled by the government it's

944
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,359
controlled by the private sector

945
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,720
things like communications channels

946
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,560
that's controlled by

947
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,959
in many places that's controlled by the

948
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,440
private sector many types of transit

949
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,640
are controlled by the private sector and

950
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,800
similarly with the electric grid so

951
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,319
this is not just a government problem

952
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,560
and we need to start thinking about it

953
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,839
more comprehensively

954
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,400
as a problem for everyone and if you

955
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,599
hold a particular belief you need to

956
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,320
make sure that you're defending that

957
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,800
belief

958
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,920
through securing your systems if you're

959
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,640
a business owner

960
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,000
or if you work for a large organization

961
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,440
this is one of the things that's

962
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,440
actually going to make the difference

963
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,560
when it comes to our elections

964
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:34,320
the second is to if you are able

965
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,320
work with the government because

966
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,119
having a partnership and this is one

967
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,160
thing that i saw in these exercises with

968
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,880
the government

969
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,000
having a partnership really makes it

970
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,920
easier for them to reach

971
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,280
out and say this is my point of contact

972
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,280
at this organization

973
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,720
they're undergoing a cyber attack that's

974
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,040
affecting election day

975
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,000
things like that very important and then

976
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,759
the last thing is to fight

977
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,320
misinformation wherever you see it

978
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,880
if you see misinformation don't engage

979
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,560
with it

980
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,320
report it and move on

981
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,240
if you see someone you know spreading

982
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,040
misinformation try to understand their

983
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,879
point of view

984
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,800
hear them and then talk to them about

985
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,680
what the reality and what the facts

986
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,680
actually look like

987
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,319
so thank you so much for attending i
