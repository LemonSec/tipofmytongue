1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,559
welcome to a decepticon and autobot walk

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,679
into a bar this is a new python tool for

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,119
enhanced opsec

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,880
i'm joe gray coming to you from uh

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,119
almost on the other side of the world

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,000
i'm here in the united states

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,400
uh so this is going to be a project that

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
i

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,640
took on to enhance

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
my own comprehension and understanding

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,160
of

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,559
both python artificial intelligence to a

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,319
degree

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,599
machine learning and natural language

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,440
processing i wrapped it all up in a way

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,680
that uh will allow a positive outcome to

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,399
occur so i'm going to go ahead and

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,920
kill my camera now uh since i've been

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,280
told that i have a

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,640
face made for our radio

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,120
uh that continuing um about me by day

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,359
i'm a senior ocean specialist complex

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,878
i have some experience with python

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,600
scripting

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,560
i'm incredibly interested in uh the data

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,600
sciences

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,760
uh as i stated previously i do

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,039
frequently compete in the trace labs

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,200
ocean search party

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,400
or missing person ctf whichever you know

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,159
it by

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,600
my team the password inspection agency

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,280
actually just won the

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,439
last competition that occurred as part

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,159
of defcon

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,199
with that uh with a lot of what i do

37
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,040
regarding

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,240
ocean uh i i look at the yen to the yang

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,119
of ocean which would be opsec

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,600
i also have advisory uh volunteer roles

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,280
with

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,919
both the national child protection task

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,680
force and operation safe escape

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,320
operation safe escape being in bold

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,840
because honestly that's the organization

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,600
that benefits most from

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,119
decepticon a few things that i'm not

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,640
i'm not a programmer or a developer

49
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,000
in nature i'm by far not a mathematician

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,040
or a data scientist

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,759
nor am i an expert when talking about

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,160
things

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,959
dealing with trafficking or domestic

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,720
violence

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,480
it's something that i'm concerned with

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,239
that's something that

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,679
i definitely have uh interest

58
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,959
in making a positive outcome but i'm by

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,640
no stretch of the imagination an expert

60
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,480
so before we get started i have a few

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,238
definitions for us to go over

62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,480
just so that we can level the playing

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,599
field with uh everything that will be

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,679
talked about in this presentation first

65
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,640
we have oscent open source intelligence

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,239
that's basically

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,920
information gathered from public sources

68
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,840
in an intelligence context we have opsec

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,760
operation security basically that's

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,879
taking steps to

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,519
obscure hide or masquerade

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,640
information about you and what you are

73
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,760
doing

74
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,359
so that adversaries or

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,280
other concerned parties will have

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,560
trouble finding you

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,239
or making any determinations in terms of

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,840
the reliability of the data

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,519
i'm a huge fan of implementing

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,319
disinformation and deception through

81
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,560
that

82
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,640
in fact implementing disinformation and

83
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,760
deception to enhance your opsec

84
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,518
is a term i've been calling that

85
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,760
decepticon for the last couple of years

86
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,680
since the name of the bot

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,679
machine learning that's just the study

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,120
of math and algorithms

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,239
to improve the automation uh

90
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,480
via learning if you will uh

91
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:40,239
so that it assists us in

92
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,280
developing algorithms uh to be able to

93
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,159
uh learn if you will uh based on the

94
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,159
outcome

95
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,840
of the data we can also do predictions

96
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,640
and decisions based on that

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,519
uh with decepticon it's mostly focusing

98
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,000
on

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,239
predictions uh data science is an

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,959
amalgam of several disciplines

101
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,760
that seeks to study uh the relationship

102
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,840
between

103
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,879
uh data structures

104
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,439
and the processes and algorithms to help

105
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,599
us gain

106
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,000
insight from the data i like to think of

107
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,880
it uh from the perspective of

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,160
data science seeks to identify patterns

109
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,238
that are it

110
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,240
not visible to the human eye or the

111
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,198
human mind

112
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,880
we have artificial intelligence yes i

113
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,440
will admit that's a term that

114
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,080
has been kind of ruined by vendors as of

115
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,160
late

116
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,680
but it's the study of intelligence shown

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,880
by machines

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,960
and programs to

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,800
attempt to mimic that natural

120
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,479
intelligence

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,479
natural intelligence being the

122
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,960
intelligence shown by humans or

123
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,719
animals and then finally we've got gpu

124
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,520
that's the graphics processing unit it's

125
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,199
a specialized

126
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,719
system on board many computers in fact

127
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,400
any computer that has any sort of

128
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
graphics has one

129
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,239
but in this scenario we're using it to

130
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,240
accelerate the processing

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,199
of images or video more specifically

132
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,320
it's used within

133
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,840
machine learning to speed up processing

134
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,000
nvidia uh has some really cool toys for

135
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,000
that

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,880
so the problem one of the leading ways

137
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,280
that adversaries find their way

138
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,479
into the lives or back into their lives

139
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,599
of their victims

140
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,000
is social media so

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,120
what is an adversary that could be a

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,520
malicious person

143
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,039
seeking financial gain that could be

144
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,320
someone just seeking to harm someone

145
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,360
else

146
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,080
abusers traffickers political opponents

147
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,440
will do that

148
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,880
uh in the united states uh we've got uh

149
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,960
the possible apocalypse coming up um in

150
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,120
uh on the first tuesday in november with

151
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,880
the election

152
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,400
i really hate to toss the term nation

153
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,639
state out but uh

154
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,799
depending on the person's threat profile

155
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,400
a nation state could legitimately be an

156
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,479
adversary for them

157
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,239
and then they you also have what i call

158
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,560
adversaries of opportunity

159
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:10,000
and that would be in the case where

160
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,919
someone has really bad opsec

161
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,120
and the adversary's just out there

162
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:19,440
looking and just happens to come across

163
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,000
that particular person and notices

164
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,680
hey this account is hemorrhaging

165
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,840
information let's exploit it and see

166
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,520
what we can get from it

167
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,679
so when we talk about victims they could

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,639
be public figures such as politicians or

169
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,560
executives

170
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,840
obviously there are some companies out

171
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,360
there

172
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,119
whose executives are universally a

173
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,319
target because of what the company does

174
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,160
or who the company does business with

175
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,600
and then we have victims of domestic

176
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,600
abuse and or trafficking

177
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,199
many times they don't have much say so

178
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,880
in the matter whatsoever

179
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,199
and then we also have people with poor

180
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,919
or misguided opsec

181
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,520
for example i was debating with a friend

182
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,560
from when i was in the navy

183
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,479
on facebook a while back uh about

184
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,280
privacy and he's like oh i don't have to

185
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,400
worry about this

186
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,359
i use a vpn and uh i was like oh cool

187
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
which one

188
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,960
and he's like oh it's a free one it's

189
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,520
this and i don't recall

190
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
what it was exactly but i pointed out

191
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,080
that with

192
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,840
a vpn especially that's one of the

193
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,639
products that you definitely want to pay

194
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,479
for

195
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,919
because you have some expectation of

196
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,919
support

197
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,280
that's not to say that your data won't

198
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,719
get sold

199
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,960
but you have a more legitimate claim

200
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,240
when it comes to that and oftentimes if

201
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,000
you don't pay for the product you are

202
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,400
the product

203
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,680
references for that see facebook and

204
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,000
google

205
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,440
thankfully for many of you you're

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,919
subjected to gdpr

207
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,360
so you have a certain level of privacy

208
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,400
and protection that

209
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,319
i only wish i had and uh to be honest

210
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,239
i had coveted not happened and i had

211
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,520
actually traveled to gerdinia for the

212
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
conference

213
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,159
i was going to hop on to some wi-fi

214
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,599
connections around the area

215
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,360
and uh use the right to be forgotten

216
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,319
because what i've learned is

217
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,599
many many platforms when you go to opt

218
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,520
out of things they don't do any

219
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,000
validation checking to verify you're a

220
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,080
citizen

221
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,840
of the european union they just look at

222
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,800
the i p address oh well this is coming

223
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,318
from the eu

224
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,120
so um kind of bummed about that but

225
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,680
uh life goes on and there's always next

226
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,000
year

227
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,080
and if not next year the year after and

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,759
eventually it will become safe for us to

229
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,880
all travel again

230
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,680
so um after i rebutted

231
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,159
that to my friend he he was like well i

232
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,679
used this dns service as well and

233
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,279
i hadn't heard of it but i looked it up

234
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,478
and it looked pretty solid and i

235
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,480
explained okay well

236
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,839
you still need to implement things like

237
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,360
https

238
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,760
if you're doing certain things you might

239
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,880
want to use tor you may want to do this

240
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,360
you may want to do that

241
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,959
and it turned into a really good private

242
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,600
conversation between my friend and i and

243
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,279
he learned a lot and i i learned quite a

244
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,080
bit myself

245
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,920
so as we dissect some advice from an

246
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,640
opsec perspective

247
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,240
if someone's being harassed or stalked

248
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,120
some of the advice i've seen tossed

249
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,959
around is

250
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:18,000
well just uh just abandon the account

251
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,920
well that's not always feasible to be

252
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,320
honest

253
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:27,279
um and with that being said

254
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,760
it could cue the adversary uh that the

255
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,959
account

256
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,720
has been abandoned uh it could

257
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,160
also um lead them to go looking for

258
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,200
alternative accounts

259
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:43,199
and if someone's using accounts

260
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,200
that doesn't have the person's real name

261
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,959
on it especially with facebook

262
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,880
i don't know if this is something that

263
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,199
you encounter uh in europe

264
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,480
but in the united states if you create a

265
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,399
facebook

266
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,000
account and they don't believe you're

267
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,000
using your real name they will prompt

268
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,600
you for a driver's license

269
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,279
and if you don't want to provide that

270
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,680
they just straight up shut the account

271
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,160
down

272
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,319
so if someone's trying to evade an

273
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,800
adversary and creates an account under a

274
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,160
fake

275
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,680
name a fictitious name

276
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,360
then that person could report the

277
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,000
account if they report it enough

278
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,079
then that account will be prompted for

279
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,680
submitting some form of identification

280
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,519
and when they fail to do so the account

281
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,439
gets burned

282
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,079
let's face it some people have to use

283
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,079
social media for work

284
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,839
me working in the ocean field i have to

285
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,760
use social media for work

286
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,440
that also being said i don't have to use

287
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,000
legitimate accounts

288
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
whereas some people have to use

289
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,839
legitimate accounts

290
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,279
either to interact with customers or to

291
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,160
run a business page

292
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,519
or something to that effect and i mean

293
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,800
i'm just going to be real here

294
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,959
why should a victim live in fear because

295
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:56,479
someone uh cannot respect their wishes

296
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,439
and their privacy and at the same time

297
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,440
some victims just

298
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,880
are not aware of the adversary until

299
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,920
it's too late

300
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,680
so continuing to dissect this if the

301
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,920
abuser wants to continue trauma

302
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,079
they can create fake accounts of their

303
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,479
own

304
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,359
they may leverage friends or friends of

305
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,640
friends that may have access to see

306
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,560
the victim's posts as i stated before

307
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,040
they may report those alternative

308
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,599
accounts for being fake

309
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,880
there was a case just about a week or

310
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,959
two ago

311
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,000
there was a young man a college student

312
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,680
in india who published a medium article

313
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,680
talking about how he had a crush that

314
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,199
ghosted him 10 years ago and he used

315
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,880
ocean techniques

316
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,760
to find her he made contact with her via

317
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,079
instagram

318
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,880
and there were some cringy things in the

319
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,239
blog post

320
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,519
up to that point but uh

321
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,279
as soon as they finished their

322
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,120
conversation on instagram he immediately

323
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,240
attempted a password reset to get an

324
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,800
email address

325
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,160
and then he continued uh trying to get

326
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,719
stuff with the email address to the

327
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,240
point of

328
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,519
trying to reset the password for the

329
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,160
email address so he could find out what

330
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,680
kind of phone she used

331
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,800
so a lot of uh methods with that and

332
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,839
honestly both of those there are

333
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,959
intelligence

334
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,079
uh attributes to attempting the password

335
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,680
reset stuff

336
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:23,279
but know that proper osant

337
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,079
typically does not allow leaving a trace

338
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,639
behind or

339
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,560
any opportunity for detection and that's

340
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,240
a little bit more hands-on and active

341
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,399
than what we typically deal with

342
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,160
with ocean at the end of the day

343
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,000
companies can still be

344
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,360
exploited so as an investigator honestly

345
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,519
if i come across someone that i'm

346
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,839
investigating and i don't find any

347
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,200
social media presence i get a lot more

348
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,240
skeptical

349
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,160
over that account uh certain things

350
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,399
playing in such as age location

351
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,439
demographics and things like that

352
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,959
but generally speaking if

353
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,959
you have one or two accounts under your

354
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,638
name i'm a lot less skeptical than if

355
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,199
you don't have any

356
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,440
and as i stated before why not have that

357
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,000
autonomy and agency over what is posted

358
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
with

359
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,040
minimal effort so here's links to

360
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,800
the code for decepticon uh

361
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,839
it is uh on github my username is

362
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,079
josephus and it's decepticon underscore

363
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,079
bot

364
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,680
uh i'll share that link again later in

365
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,560
the presentation as well

366
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,279
so the code itself is written in python

367
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,279
i have

368
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,880
two current versions only one is

369
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,639
released at this time

370
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,120
one is leveraging tensorflow and cross

371
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,720
i'm using the nvidia port of tensorflow

372
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
version 2.2

373
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,079
the other version is written with pi

374
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,440
torch but i'm not discussing it in this

375
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,439
presentation because i still need to

376
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,000
work out quite a few kinks with it

377
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,120
i use pandas to organize the data and

378
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,880
data frames

379
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,360
it's just an easier way for me to get

380
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,439
the data put across

381
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,800
that and honestly the books that i was

382
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,000
using to

383
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,079
learn about automation uh machine

384
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,079
learning and all that stuff using python

385
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,638
uh they heavily advocated the use of

386
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,239
pandas

387
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,800
so i went along with it for that and i

388
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,160
just it kind of stuck

389
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,160
so within the code uh

390
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,399
keras is used to implement a long short

391
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,279
term memory model

392
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,320
which is used to predict sequences of

393
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,519
the text and

394
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,839
then thus generate the text

395
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,519
so it's a long short term memory model

396
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,639
in short it's a type of recurrent neural

397
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,680
network

398
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,320
more specifically a neural network

399
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,000
too far a recurrent neural network is

400
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,399
something that takes past decisions

401
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,240
into mind and that's going to influence

402
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,160
the outcome with that

403
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,720
they can also remember previous things

404
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,160
learned so in order to do that

405
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,680
if the model is not actively running you

406
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,600
just have to save it to

407
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,680
a specific file so that it can be

408
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,560
reloaded the next time that

409
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,079
the code runs and the model needs to

410
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,719
execute

411
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,439
the reason these are very useful for

412
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,320
things like

413
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,360
text speech and images is that a

414
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,760
recurrent learner

415
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,959
neural network is not of a fixed vector

416
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,040
size

417
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:17,359
and as we know within natural speech

418
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,719
we don't have fixed vectors for example

419
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,959
if i greet you

420
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,000
you may say hello good morning good

421
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,359
afternoon

422
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,720
how are you get out of my face all those

423
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,199
things have different

424
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,759
lengths different characters different

425
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,240
lengths of words

426
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,920
so we can't say there's a fixed vector

427
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,880
size for that

428
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,560
so a long short term memory model in

429
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,600
that

430
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,439
in that specific vein seeks to learn

431
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,320
order dependencies and do sequence

432
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,040
prediction

433
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,240
so that's very important for generating

434
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,319
text

435
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,320
and honestly it doesn't even care what

436
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,880
language the text is in

437
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,240
so you could i've not tested this but

438
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,639
you could put it

439
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,800
against uh text from any language and it

440
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,839
should be able to do that same

441
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,079
order of dependencies and sequence

442
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,519
prediction

443
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,399
so again because of the prediction and

444
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,920
dependency

445
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,839
analysis that makes lstms very

446
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,959
lucrative for natural language

447
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,040
processing

448
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,399
another way i've not fully researched

449
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,000
this yet either but another way you

450
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,680
could accomplish this may be markov

451
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,279
chains

452
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,680
and me not having that solid math

453
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,680
background i'm still working on bringing

454
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,560
up the rear in terms of

455
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,560
taking some math classes that uh

456
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,160
honestly are at the undergraduate level

457
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,399
i'm basically going to satisfy the

458
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,519
requirements of an undergrad in math

459
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,600
uh before i start two additional

460
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,000
master's programs

461
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,000
so how does the code itself work

462
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,920
basically i use the python

463
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,279
twitter package and the twitter api to

464
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,759
authenticate to twitter and pull the

465
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:01,120
tweets down for the user

466
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:04,720
by default the tool only reads the

467
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,439
particular user's tweets but

468
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,480
i have modified the code uh if you look

469
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,319
on the github repo

470
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,760
it is actually under the sock version

471
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,520
uh where you can read anyone's tweets as

472
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,480
long as the

473
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,679
account tied to the api can view them so

474
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,360
if someone's blocked you

475
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,280
or has a protected account you can't see

476
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,159
it you can't you can't read from their

477
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,160
tweets but anybody else you can

478
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,200
so from there we capture the text the

479
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,600
time of the tweet

480
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,360
and we measure lexical diversity

481
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,080
basically that's the ratio of the words

482
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,918
used

483
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,240
uh compared to the length of the text

484
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,120
right now it's not really that important

485
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,360
but in

486
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,479
subsequent versions i've got some

487
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,918
revisions

488
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,440
planned i don't know when i'm going to

489
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,280
get to them because i'm in the process

490
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,960
of rewriting some training that i offer

491
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,960
as the ascension

492
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,080
but i have plans for assessing say time

493
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,520
of day

494
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,600
and other things including also adding

495
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,879
replies retweets and

496
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,240
responding to uh messages

497
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,039
i also have plans to do a fork of it um

498
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,400
called intercepticon that would actually

499
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,360
identify

500
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,120
other bot accounts and then with lexical

501
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,879
diversity that could also be used to

502
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,159
potentially identify

503
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,640
uh if the tweet was written

504
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,640
from someone that's a non-native speaker

505
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,679
of a particular language

506
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,240
especially if they used like say google

507
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:38,080
translate to convert

508
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,400
russian to english or

509
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,320
mandarin chinese to spanish or something

510
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,120
to that effect

511
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,559
um from there we tokenize it we i

512
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,639
tokenize it by words

513
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,160
i've i've done limited testing with

514
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,640
doing it by sentence

515
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,640
but it just didn't really uh jive at

516
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,080
that time so i need to do some more work

517
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,480
with that

518
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,840
and then we add it to the corpus within

519
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,080
machine learning

520
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,760
and natural language processing a corpus

521
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,799
is basically a fancy word

522
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,039
or not so fancy word for basically a bag

523
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,000
of words this is the input text this is

524
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,280
what we are using to

525
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,360
train it with uh from there we get some

526
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,240
standard stats like standard deviations

527
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,120
and mean and then we also calculate the

528
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,679
post interval

529
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,600
then we move into the generate module

530
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,160
that's where we establish our

531
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,199
vector sizes and sequences since we

532
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,080
don't have a fixed

533
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,640
size and then we also measure the unique

534
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,600
patterns

535
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,600
in the corpus we set up the files

536
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,360
associated with the model

537
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,000
in both json and h5 we define the model

538
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,678
and the associated parameters such as we

539
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,039
are doing an lstm

540
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:51,840
uh model it's going to be 160 bits

541
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,080
we are setting our sequence at 500 and

542
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,080
we want to run for seven epochs

543
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,600
uh from there we go into the trainer

544
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,199
module that's going to create some

545
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,480
pseudo-random seed to begin the tweet

546
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,480
generation from

547
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,559
and then the next module will execute

548
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,559
the model and assess the predictions

549
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,320
we work through a logic check and

550
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,120
basically what that does

551
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,320
is through my testing if you look on my

552
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,439
c underscore three p

553
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,799
joe account uh back in

554
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,400
um i think june and july you'll see a

555
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,158
bunch of odd tweets

556
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,320
that are nothing but apostrophe comma um

557
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,760
combinations uh repetitively with like

558
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,678
two or three words in them

559
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,280
uh that's because decepticon i was

560
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,840
originally training decepticon against

561
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,520
that account

562
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,399
and it was just picking up on that

563
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,400
and it became problematic so i within

564
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,600
the logic check i filter out

565
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,880
uh any links any mentions

566
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,080
any hashtags uh any known characters

567
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,200
that i saw

568
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,199
that uh would come across and

569
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,320
make it a little bit more glaringly

570
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,159
obvious that

571
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,840
this wasn't written by a person after

572
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,039
all that's done we tweet

573
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,918
and then after that we wait and

574
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,440
that's going to be based on the uh post

575
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,679
interval

576
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,120
now we are coming up on the

577
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,120
demonstration piece

578
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:17,439
so uh bear with me while i get that

579
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:20,639
pulled up

580
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,480
let me get it here i

581
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:31,840
just had it i had it loaded previous

582
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,840
but no big deal

583
00:21:48,880 --> 00:22:02,470
let me swap screens with it

584
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,470
[Music]

585
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,559
can everyone see my video

586
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,120
so at this rate we are just uh kicking

587
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,480
off

588
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,959
the code so it's just running

589
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,480
it'll be just a moment uh this is kind

590
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,919
of a little bit of a long demo but i'm

591
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,840
going to talk through it

592
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,880
uh so there we see it's connected to the

593
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,918
twitter it's receiving the tweets

594
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,200
it's tokenizing it at this point uh we

595
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,440
are able to see

596
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,720
links so these are all the twitter links

597
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,520
we can look at mentions

598
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,880
so these are the accounts that uh the

599
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,240
accounts that were

600
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,200
uh observed mentioned

601
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,559
and then we start the in-depth analysis

602
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,559
of the number of characters

603
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,158
so just doing some more stuff with that

604
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,719
we see here

605
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,799
it has identified the tensorflow device

606
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:03,440
and the physical gpu

607
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,440
and it started the first epoch

608
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,480
this is just an interval of analysis so

609
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,760
this is going to take just a second this

610
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,799
entire process took

611
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,919
about half an hour total so

612
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:21,200
there are parts of this where i applied

613
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,360
a filter to make it go a lot faster

614
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,760
so here we've already started that first

615
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:30,520
interval uh as we can see here

616
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,158
it takes um in the case it takes about

617
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,080
160 seconds

618
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,360
so right at two and a half minutes to do

619
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,399
this so this is going to speed up

620
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,320
at this rate this is just looking at the

621
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,799
analysis of my jetson nano

622
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,840
platform that i'm running this on here

623
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:51,918
we see the gpu is almost pegged out

624
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,639
um and then as we go through everything

625
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,960
here

626
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,600
uh we can see that this was as it was

627
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,840
initializing the gpu device

628
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,000
it stopped and then as the analysis

629
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:08,480
started it's kicked back up

630
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,480
take a quick look at some cpu data

631
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,600
so nothing too exciting here and then

632
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,880
this is just looking at the memory

633
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,719
notice i've got 50 gigs of swap

634
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,320
after you've ran the code for a few

635
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,600
times and you're in waiting mode

636
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,439
you're going to need that because you're

637
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,879
going to run out of ram and you need

638
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:31,679
that swap to be able to drop it over

639
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,440
so i have a 256 gig

640
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,760
micro sd card that the operating

641
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,120
system's running on as well as

642
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,960
um about a one terabyte solid state

643
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,399
drive that i've got an expansion board

644
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,840
connecting with but we'll look at that a

645
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,240
little bit later

646
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,399
here we have some control information

647
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,679
this is where we can control the fan

648
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,880
and then this is just some data here so

649
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,279
um we go back here we're gonna see that

650
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,320
this

651
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:01,360
speeds up tremendously again

652
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,879
so i did an eight times speed up

653
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,279
on this um and then we're going to

654
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,480
shift over notice the host names george

655
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,799
george jetson

656
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,840
uh so here we see that the gpu is about

657
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,760
to drop off

658
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,120
and then what we will notice is once the

659
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,919
gpu usage drops off tremendously

660
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,439
that that's in that's indicative of it

661
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:29,840
moving from one epoch

662
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:29,840
to another

663
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,840
there it just dropped down pretty

664
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,919
tremendously

665
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:43,840
and then as we shift back over notice

666
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:43,840
we've started a new epoch

667
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:53,600
so there that goes i'm just gonna

668
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,600
move this along a bit so number three

669
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,720
number four number five

670
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,640
number six

671
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,840
number six is almost done so we'll go

672
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,679
here

673
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,199
i'm gonna get close to the end of number

674
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,400
seven

675
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,080
okay so it should be good here and then

676
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:25,200
uh

677
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,879
the uh the timing will realign

678
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,240
since i had that initial technical

679
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,159
difficulty

680
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,919
um just want to make sure so here we see

681
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,760
the random seed has been created and

682
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,159
we're initializing the process to create

683
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,158
a tweet

684
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,559
so right here is what it tweeted so if

685
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,239
we can actually see this on the account

686
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,559
uh which i've already got the query set

687
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,200
up so i'll show you uh basically this

688
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:53,200
just from one of the six accounts that

689
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,120
it's following this is something

690
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,600
basically saying for vuln disclosure

691
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,719
anti-vaxxers vaccines cause autism me

692
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,399
y'all are idiots trump promises a covet

693
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,720
vaccine before the election

694
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,360
me decepticon how fitting

695
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,279
uh so we've got a sleep interval here uh

696
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,799
it's gonna sleep for 76 seconds

697
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,400
that's for the purpose of demonstration

698
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,480
i actually altered the post enter the

699
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,720
lines of code dealing with post interval

700
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,000
normally this would be uh the post

701
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,000
interval uh

702
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,799
minus um between zero and 480 seconds

703
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,159
just for

704
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,480
a slight pseudo-randomization

705
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,399
and we're going to see here in just a

706
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,799
second the process kicks right back

707
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,439
off tokenizes tweets does everything and

708
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,158
then

709
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,080
creating the model and that's pretty

710
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,440
much how the code runs

711
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,678
um to actually look at the code

712
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,159
um here's the requirements file so this

713
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,360
is everything that we need to install

714
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:54,720
uh to get it to run this is a file where

715
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,719
we input our twitter api keys

716
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,039
uh obviously i've not saved the file

717
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,440
because i just cut my own keys out

718
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:06,799
but that's how we go about doing it

719
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:17,679
and i probably just closed

720
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:20,320
i did

721
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,320
you reopen

722
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,399
and because there's so many imports i

723
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,720
didn't want to eat up this many lines of

724
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:34,639
code so i just do an import

725
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:37,039
uh or i do one single import here

726
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,159
and import everything over here so just

727
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,720
a few things like

728
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,000
random and json here there's pandas

729
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,039
there's numpy

730
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,880
tensorflow several cross things so

731
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,879
sequential lstm uh so that we can get

732
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,000
all that we have the tokenizer here as

733
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,039
well

734
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,559
uh there's h5 uh i've got natural

735
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,360
language toolkit but i don't really use

736
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,678
it right now

737
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,000
aside from the word tokenized thing and

738
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,200
then import the twitter package and

739
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,600
the twitter api keys so here's the code

740
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,360
we do the import we set the encoding

741
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,439
and then we have all those definitions

742
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,600
but here at the bottom

743
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,600
we download stop words that's not used

744
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,840
in this current version

745
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,719
uh because stop words would be things

746
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,039
like and

747
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,039
the or it would make it kind of awkward

748
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,559
so i've not implemented that part yet

749
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,080
but i still download it just for the

750
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,760
sake of having it

751
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,279
we get the current directory we check

752
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,200
for the presence of a subdirectory

753
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,799
called files if not we make it if it

754
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,640
exists we continue

755
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,799
we set the stop words but we don't use

756
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,399
them again there's the physical device

757
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,360
so we look for gpus

758
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,320
if it works great if not we continue uh

759
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,639
here's the

760
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,000
structure to connect to the api so it's

761
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,080
just giving the keys

762
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,240
we're setting tweet mode to extended so

763
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,399
that we get all 280 characters

764
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,080
and if we don't set sleep on rate limit

765
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,559
to true we're going to limit ourselves

766
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,960
to between 24 and 32 tweets depending on

767
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,399
how

768
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,840
fast our system connects so

769
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,918
takes a little bit longer but we can

770
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,199
pull down up to 200 tweets with the free

771
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,120
api

772
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,120
we've set the model to sequential and

773
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,120
then results that's just to get the user

774
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,158
time on with the api information next we

775
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,158
move to login

776
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,559
so we're going to go back all the way to

777
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,559
the top

778
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,440
and from here there's connected

779
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,919
retrieving tweets

780
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,880
when we set the global variable for data

781
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,320
frame

782
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,640
make sure we move into the correct

783
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,559
directory here are the users that the

784
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,919
code as it's running right now

785
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,960
are evaluating i've got consent of all

786
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,919
these users

787
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,440
uh four of them are men who are women

788
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,039
some people live in the same area some

789
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,200
people don't so there's a little bit of

790
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:48,480
diversity of that obviously it's not an

791
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,480
accurate sample of the population but

792
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,159
i just wanted six accounts to work with

793
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,640
in this case it's creating a

794
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,320
files underscore sock dot csv because

795
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,399
this is kind of operating as if it's a

796
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,360
sock account

797
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:03,039
we uh create the data frame uh with the

798
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,039
columns of tweets times like school

799
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,960
diversity and the user

800
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,760
the version that just reads from your

801
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,880
account does not have the user column

802
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,519
and then we move into tokenization if we

803
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,360
have

804
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,000
the csv file there then basically what

805
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,158
we're going

806
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,120
to do is we're going to import it and

807
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,480
then move on

808
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,199
lexical diversity there's the

809
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,399
measurement going into tokenization

810
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,240
we have bag of hash bag of

811
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,320
mentions and links so that's going to be

812
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,880
hashtags mentions and links

813
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,879
just capturing all of them here we have

814
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,519
a for loop for each user

815
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,640
we pull everything down we're not

816
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,679
focusing on retweets

817
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,320
or replies right now uh and then from

818
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,880
there

819
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,480
we get the full text we split that i've

820
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,919
got regular expressions to be able to

821
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,919
put things into the appropriate bags

822
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:58,320
um and then we move into the hopper

823
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,279
from here we replicate a little bit of

824
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,080
that effort

825
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,120
and then we have the tweet time so that

826
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,240
we can create it

827
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:10,080
put it into epoch time so it's a linear

828
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:13,200
time from january 1st 1970

829
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,519
that allows us to measure the

830
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,519
distance between tweets and pull that

831
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,440
standard deviation

832
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,880
uh and then from there we're gonna go

833
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,080
into the sorter

834
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:27,360
which is where we will actually

835
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,760
um iterate and uh

836
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,039
tokenize so here we're using the word

837
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,720
tokenizer

838
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,879
we put everything into a single um list

839
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,640
and then we tokenize it put that into

840
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,320
the bag of words

841
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,679
uh we write it to the csv before we uh

842
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,360
we write everything that's in the data

843
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,399
frame to the csv

844
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,120
before we move on collect our stats

845
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,399
so here we've got our lexical diversity

846
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,600
we get the mean

847
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,399
and the standard deviation for lexical

848
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,678
diversities

849
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,439
as well as times uh post interval

850
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,080
that's nothing more than the standard

851
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,320
deviation of time

852
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,840
so standard deviation in between the

853
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,840
epoch times that's how i

854
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,840
arrive at post interval

855
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,879
next we do our frequency analysis

856
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,480
and then we go into generate at this

857
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,840
rate we convert all the characters to

858
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,240
numbers so that it fits into the lstm

859
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,240
correctly uh

860
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,799
from there we define our x and y

861
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,320
sequence length of 500

862
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,720
that's something that i toyed with in

863
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,439
terms of shorter and longer numbers 500

864
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,559
for this seems to be the sweet spot so

865
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,159
then we just append

866
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,519
things to the xy plots we determine

867
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,519
the number of patterns based on the

868
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,760
length of the x data

869
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,519
and then there we move into pre-model

870
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,720
and training

871
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,240
so pre-modeling this is just checking to

872
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,559
see if we already have a model defined

873
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,600
so there's the h5 and the json

874
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:01,678
uh we can load um and then

875
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:04,158
once we see that we take the x and the y

876
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,720
put it in seven epochs batch size of

877
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,519
eight

878
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,960
that's just going to be the size of the

879
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,239
stuff that's put in

880
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,918
if you have it too large it will crash

881
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,279
if you have it too small it'll take

882
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,638
forever

883
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,480
the checkpoint that's what we saw with

884
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,960
all the epochs

885
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,159
we defined the loss model as categorical

886
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,399
cross-entropy

887
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,679
the optimizer is rms prop um to be

888
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,839
honest i'm not 100

889
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,079
sure on that side uh i looked at the

890
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,839
various options and basically ran a b

891
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,560
testing to see what got the most

892
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,239
accuracy

893
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,759
and then from there we move into the

894
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,799
actual modeling

895
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,240
so we define 160 bit model

896
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:47,200
input shapes return the sequences we

897
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,158
do a few iterations of that uh the

898
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,638
dropout

899
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,839
that's at 60 i could have left this last

900
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,679
value at 60

901
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,599
but i put it at 40 just to see if

902
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,599
anything would change it did increase

903
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,720
accuracy a little bit

904
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:04,160
um and then from there we compile

905
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,919
there's our checkpoints that's what we

906
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,319
see when it comes up

907
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,520
and then here's where it actually goes

908
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,760
on to the gpu

909
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,759
and what we actually see on the screen

910
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,839
from here once it's done uh we will

911
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,359
convert all the numbers in the lstm back

912
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,359
to characters

913
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,598
uh and then that's where the random seed

914
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:29,520
is created

915
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:32,079
uh from there we will

916
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,480
go through and basically do a for loop

917
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,839
and just reassemble everything

918
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,599
uh that's where we're gonna get our

919
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,920
results in terms of

920
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,680
what it's actually saying here's the

921
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,160
logic check and the cleanup pattern

922
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,279
notice all the stuff it's just removing

923
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,560
um and then here's where it goes to

924
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,400
sleep in the repeater

925
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,240
so there's the normal sleeping interval

926
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,160
right now i've got sleeping on intervals

927
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,720
of 40 to 80 seconds

928
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,680
so realistically this could get two

929
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,759
maybe

930
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,720
three tweets out and then it's just

931
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,880
gonna wait

932
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,078
at the end of that time it wakes back up

933
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,839
and it starts the process

934
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,960
all over again so

935
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:14,240
that's pretty much the process there so

936
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,839
about the project itself it started

937
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,598
around december 2019

938
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,040
i ran into some hurdles shiny objects

939
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,599
delays etc

940
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,680
i had written some things in python like

941
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,000
wikileaker and some other the recon

942
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,720
module recon ng module associated with

943
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,320
it

944
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,118
um but i am by no means a pretty python

945
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,640
coder

946
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,560
um i am not even really

947
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,400
an efficient one to be honest as i

948
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,799
stated before i've been reading about it

949
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,640
and i was trying to implement some

950
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,920
things i was working

951
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:49,200
with uh safe escape on some stuff and

952
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,280
i wrong so basically

953
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,279
i decided that this would be a good

954
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,599
practical explanation

955
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,880
um as usual the project stalled around

956
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,920
march around

957
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,280
covid season uh and then i

958
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,240
was on a podcast of sorts and someone

959
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,720
was talking about the

960
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,520
jetson platform this might solve my

961
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,439
problem

962
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,040
so i ported the code over started

963
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,000
playing with the tool it worked really

964
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,680
well

965
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,599
uh i was doing it the original

966
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,598
development in a virtual machine

967
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,839
i mean i gave it eight gigs of ram and

968
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,880
three cores it was on a radeon gpu

969
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,759
on my mac and it wasn't efficient

970
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,400
basically each epoch took about 55

971
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,920
minutes

972
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,480
as opposed to under three minutes

973
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,680
so this is the jetson platform on the

974
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,560
left we see

975
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,598
the jetson nano and then we have the usb

976
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,119
3.1 bridge to connect to the t300 board

977
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,440
that's the expansion board that allows

978
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,680
me to run the solid state drive

979
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,920
on the right that's just a regular uh

980
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,720
jetson nano board

981
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,240
they're fairly inexpensive uh i've got

982
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,560
the t300 board in

983
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,479
this particular case i don't have the

984
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,520
antennas or the camera on it

985
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,320
and i have about 250 us dollars wrapped

986
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,920
up in it

987
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,480
but basically it's got 128 cuda core gpu

988
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,560
uh

989
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,280
four gigs of ram and it's running a quad

990
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:12,720
core arm processor

991
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,599
so nothing to scoff at but

992
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,200
it's by no means a super computer i like

993
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,440
it because it's external to my regular

994
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,200
host so i can continue to do

995
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,640
other things on my computer while

996
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,240
testing this

997
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,160
and i'm able to have that enhanced gpu

998
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,439
as well

999
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,399
i've looked into hosting gpu

1000
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,079
processing in the cloud and it is not

1001
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,800
cheap

1002
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,480
so my lessons learned data science is

1003
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,400
not a walk in the park especially if you

1004
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,960
lack that heavy math background

1005
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,480
honestly pie torch is faster but i've

1006
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,520
not been able to replicate the

1007
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,079
reliability

1008
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,920
and if you've seen the tweets there

1009
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,040
that's to be lacking so pi torch is even

1010
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,320
worse

1011
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,640
uh if you're testing this on your

1012
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,040
regular account uh make sure

1013
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,000
you've tweeted frequently and something

1014
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,200
of substance as of

1015
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,440
late uh all i had been tweeting had been

1016
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,560
uh announcements for my upcoming

1017
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,359
training

1018
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,040
and my tweet interval was 12 minutes or

1019
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,680
i'm sorry 12 days

1020
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,720
so what i ended up having to do to try

1021
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,799
to influence it

1022
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,399
i broke uh several poems and songs

1023
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,320
such as all-star are never going to give

1024
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,760
you up as well as the raven

1025
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,240
wasteland and we wear the mask into 280

1026
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,520
character chunks and tweeted them so

1027
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,640
that i could influence

1028
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:36,560
that post interval and have uh

1029
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,560
more information but

1030
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,880
that worked and it created some

1031
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,560
interesting tweets

1032
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,000
another thing you should be cognizant of

1033
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,440
is if you're testing something like this

1034
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,200
on your regular account

1035
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,880
people are people are probably going to

1036
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,759
start unfollowing you

1037
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,880
and they will probably uh be a little

1038
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,200
bit angry with you

1039
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,320
so i highly recommend testing it on an

1040
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,879
account that

1041
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,839
uh you don't use as heavily like what

1042
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,240
i've done

1043
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,480
honestly there was a lot of a b testing

1044
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,160
and hypothesizing with this

1045
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,200
and just know that around 200 tweets

1046
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,319
that only have 280 characters that is a

1047
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,439
very small data set for an lstm for

1048
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,720
example

1049
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,839
the book i was working through was using

1050
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,480
the book of genesis uh as

1051
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,759
a corpus as well as a few other books

1052
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,599
like harry potter

1053
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,720
and the chamber of secrets i actually

1054
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,079
was the sorcerer's stone but

1055
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,598
nevertheless

1056
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:37,520
something a lot larger than you know

1057
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,119
a possibility of uh 56 000 characters

1058
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,280
that's pretty short

1059
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,800
so limitations right now i've only

1060
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,880
written the code to make use of the

1061
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,400
the gpus and cuda course if you do it on

1062
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,599
a vm or a server it's going to be very

1063
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,440
time consuming

1064
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,640
like i said gpu in the cloud is very

1065
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,560
expensive

1066
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,160
and the model is dependent upon what

1067
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,359
your account has posted if you're

1068
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,440
setting this up

1069
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:00,160
for uh some violence and they have never

1070
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,599
posted

1071
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,960
you're going to want to use the sock

1072
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,760
version to have it pull from some other

1073
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,319
accounts

1074
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,680
if the account was just wiped out it's

1075
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,800
going to need to be the same thing

1076
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,440
but you're going to need to get some

1077
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:21,599
things posted to have something to work

1078
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:21,599
off of
