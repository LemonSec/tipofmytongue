1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,320
thank you very much

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,440
and uh thanks for having me it's uh

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,840
great to be here

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,800
i really um have fond memories of being

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,880
in poland

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,560
jimmy um last year so it was an

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,160
excellent conference and so i'm excited

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,720
to present again

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,160
this presentation the art of the breach

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,919
this presentation

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,360
is a physical security presentation

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,079
however i've added a few twists one

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,079
is i really like physical security and

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,040
all the presentations i've watched

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,079
always focus on a specific area and what

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,800
i've always wanted to

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,480
see was okay that's great but how do i

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,718
go further or how do i go

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,680
all the way into a building from the

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,000
sidewalk

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,160
all the way into say the executive

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,920
filing cabinet right so the complete

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,680
journey so that's what i want to take

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,120
you on today but then

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,360
also due to what i do and the people i

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,320
spend time with i have special knowledge

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,600
around what we call

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,919
forced entry so what i want to do is add

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,158
that

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,200
on as well as a third option as we

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,119
proceed

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,640
through that building we're going to

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,520
look at passive entries social

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,119
engineering

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,880
covert entry which is you know lock

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,360
picking and that sort of thing but then

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,360
also

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,799
forced entry which is really just kind

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,759
of brute force i'm

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,799
getting in any means possible so that's

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,040
the journey i want to take you on today

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,840
a little bit about myself before we get

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,360
started

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,320
so i am the founder and president of the

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,600
nonprofit called trace labs we do

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,279
crowdsourcing for

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,520
open source intelligence for missing

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,280
persons we do monthly ctfs we have one

49
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,798
coming up next week if you're interested

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,799
you go to our website you'll find more

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,680
information about that

52
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,320
uh as a profession of course i work in

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,799
i.t

54
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,398
and security is a big component of that

55
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,280
in the aerospace industry been doing

56
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,439
that for

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,560
more years than i can remember i've

58
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,240
competed at

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,360
defcon twice in the sectf came in third

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,799
twice there

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,160
great experience for anybody who's

62
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,200
planning to do that let me know and i

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,480
can give you some

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,879
some tips on that i also volunteer

65
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,160
so in search and rescue and specialize

66
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,760
as a tracker and that

67
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,920
that actually helps me quite a bit with

68
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,239
my ocean and if you want to reach

69
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,040
out to me my twitter and email address

70
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,879
are there

71
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,319
in particular if you have suggestions

72
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,000
for this talk

73
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,119
that would be great any feedback is

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,120
greatly appreciated

75
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,319
okay so the standard disclaimer

76
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,160
uh you know really uh this material

77
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,958
doesn't represent any employers

78
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,160
past present or future i have a lot of

79
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,640
bad ideas

80
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,400
and so i wouldn't want that to transfer

81
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,720
on to anybody else and

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,840
also risk of incarceration of course

83
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,560
this material or

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,000
is going to take you through the journey

85
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
from sidewalk to

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,680
filing cabinet and we're going to go

87
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,280
through that

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,959
and it's we're going to show you from an

89
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,519
attacker's point of view

90
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,879
and of course that could be used poorly

91
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,120
in the wrong hands

92
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,720
so really what we need to do is make

93
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,680
sure that you all understand that really

94
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,000
this is for

95
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,000
educational purposes for a defender to

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,800
see how an attacker would think how

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,920
an attacker would proceed with your

98
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,599
physical security

99
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,319
and how as a defender you can defend

100
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,319
against that

101
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,119
all right so this overlay is basically a

102
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,920
graphical representation

103
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,519
of what we're going to do today so we're

104
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,159
going to start off with some

105
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,200
homework and go through the research and

106
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,319
then we're going to arrive

107
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,159
on site that icon 3 in the bottom corner

108
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,518
and then we're going to navigate our way

109
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,798
through the building

110
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,360
deploying different security breach

111
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,360
techniques

112
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,480
so the first thing we want to do is of

113
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,079
course research our target this is where

114
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,679
our osint comes in

115
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,120
we want to do of course our passive

116
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,519
reconnaissance what i also call

117
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,360
zero touch reconnaissance we don't want

118
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,040
them to know we're looking of course

119
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,519
and we want to start off at a high level

120
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,480
and drill down in the details

121
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,200
just deploying some best practices for

122
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,599
osint

123
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,599
and we teach a lot of this at trace labs

124
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,880
you want to probably use a dedicated vm

125
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,199
if you can

126
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,960
uh you know use sock puppets if you can

127
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,840
if you're not accustomed to using sock

128
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,840
puppets

129
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,198
or if you don't have those set up you

130
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,479
can use

131
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,759
your account but you'd have to be

132
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,840
extremely careful uh during the scctf i

133
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,520
use my own account on linkedin

134
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,799
and i'm looking at everybody's profile

135
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,400
and the next day i noticed they're all

136
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,560
looking back at me so

137
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,440
total newbie mistake you don't want to

138
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,360
do that so learn from from my mistakes

139
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,199
uh vpn of course is great too and not

140
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,680
just to protect your

141
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,479
security but it's also handy to be able

142
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,560
to appear

143
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,639
somewhere else for ocean and for this

144
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,080
sort of thing so there are several

145
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,840
reasons why you may want to look at a

146
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,680
vpn for this type of work

147
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,919
and then of course finally organizing

148
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,720
your ocean so this is a big deal and i

149
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,280
think a lot of people

150
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,080
jump into an ocean operation without

151
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,080
properly

152
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,680
kind of preparing for it that way where

153
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,039
am i going to put all my stuff right

154
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,120
how am i going to organize it by

155
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,440
category what's important

156
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,360
all those details so stop and put some

157
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,840
thought into that before you jump right

158
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,840
into it

159
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,320
all right another thing we want to do is

160
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,199
really understand their business right

161
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
do they make

162
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,720
tires do they do they uh are they a

163
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,919
security company uh

164
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,360
because that would make a big difference

165
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,639
right if their focus is security they're

166
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,400
gonna actually probably have a higher

167
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,759
level of security we hope

168
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,840
uh how big is it uh how many employees

169
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,000
is it just an executive office or just a

170
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,919
field office what does that look like

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,840
look at the employees online or are

172
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,758
there a lot of social butter butterflies

173
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,000
that's the 80 20 rule i'm going to focus

174
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,280
on those social butterfly butterflies

175
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,199
because that's where i'm going to get

176
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,719
all my good oceans right

177
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,479
i find that there's usually a couple

178
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,360
people in any office that are just

179
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,880
giving you

180
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,039
everything so those are the ones you

181
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,800
want to check out vendors this is

182
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,479
another great one so this will help us

183
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,680
develop our pre-taxes when we want to

184
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,440
get into the building

185
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,000
because maybe i'm going to show up as

186
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,199
their parking vendor or their cafeteria

187
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,960
vendor or

188
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,960
their shredding vendor anything like

189
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,000
that but if i know who that company is i

190
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,840
can better prepare

191
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,840
for that

192
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,400
and now we want to take a look at their

193
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,280
infrastructure so all the services that

194
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,440
they consume

195
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,679
i'm a i'm interested in but then also

196
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,160
what are the things that are on site

197
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,680
one of the things you can often find is

198
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,720
the floor plans

199
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,319
so if you can find their if they are

200
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,160
renting or leasing the building you can

201
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,319
often find that online with the property

202
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,240
management company

203
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,000
first responder key boxes so i'm gonna

204
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,199
get into that that's gonna be really

205
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,840
interesting so uh cafeteria or jim

206
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,400
which one do they have if any hvac on

207
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,359
the roof

208
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,479
that's one of my go-to pretext because i

209
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,479
know a lot about that

210
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,560
so it's easy for me to talk about it

211
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,039
whatever you know a lot about is much

212
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,280
easier to use as your pretext so that's

213
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,639
that's what i'd highly recommend in that

214
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,880
case

215
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,240
ingress egress points so it's if i do

216
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,919
get in okay

217
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,319
how do i get out right so i really want

218
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,960
to make sure that i understand my

219
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,000
my path for exit if i'm all the way in

220
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,638
and all of a sudden i have to get out in

221
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,840
a hurry

222
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,840
that's something i really need to think

223
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,758
about you'll find that real criminals

224
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,880
are very concerned about that too the

225
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,240
last thing that they want

226
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,000
is to be stuck with their hand in the

227
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,120
cookie jar and get

228
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,759
caught with evidence we've had

229
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,120
incidents where the person is confronted

230
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,440
and they're trying to hide

231
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,400
the the stolen property right as they

232
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,360
evade

233
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,520
so watch out for that magnetic lock so

234
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,639
during a power outage is it secure open

235
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,878
or secure fail

236
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,560
what does that look like perimeter

237
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,840
layers this is very important too so as

238
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,039
a defense

239
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,039
layering is uh highly recommended so man

240
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,440
traps fences

241
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,800
all those things that deter attackers

242
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,840
and make them think yeah i'm going to go

243
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,400
somewhere else

244
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,400
so that's what we want to look for as an

245
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,960
attacker

246
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,599
understand the defenses so do you have

247
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,719
guards do you have cctv

248
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,800
all these things are going to

249
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,400
deter me they're all going to add up to

250
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,160
that that big picture

251
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,159
what type of door locks do you have

252
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,960
right did you just buy the cheapo locks

253
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,639
or do you have

254
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,878
good quality quality locks that are

255
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,800
going to cause me a problem

256
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,719
patterns of life so is the office open

257
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,799
24x7 and maybe they have

258
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,800
a reduced security uh at certain points

259
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,120
is it a very fluid environment where we

260
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,800
see people coming and going all the time

261
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,720
or is it much more formalized so

262
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,000
everybody's maybe wearing a suit with

263
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,600
official id

264
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,480
you know what does that look like and

265
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,720
great sources for that of course are

266
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,240
youtube office tours i find are golden

267
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,839
if you can find one of those

268
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,160
if your company has one of those out

269
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,480
there i would watch it in slow motion

270
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,319
and even frame by frame if you want

271
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,399
because i can tell you as an attacker

272
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,800
you can quite often find just

273
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,959
golden nuggets out of that what type of

274
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,359
id cards they use where security cameras

275
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,920
are

276
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,680
all the good stuff so and then of course

277
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,360
employee social media is usually you're

278
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,120
going to find one or two people

279
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,640
that have a lot of information so i

280
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,480
don't i think that companies really

281
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,120
should spend more time looking at their

282
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,200
employees

283
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,880
as far as what they post putting out the

284
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,000
vpn information is not a good idea

285
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,320
putting out what kind of

286
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,080
cards they use not a good idea so some

287
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,399
governance around that would be a good

288
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,399
idea

289
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,800
now we want to basically basically now

290
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,040
we've done our research

291
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,719
and now we want to prepare our pretext

292
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,160
we really really want to build those

293
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,000
stories and have them very

294
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,640
comfortable and so some of those that we

295
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,880
can you

296
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,279
use our new employee or contractor

297
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,360
that's good because you can act confused

298
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,600
oh i don't know where i'm going i'm not

299
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,519
sure where the office is can you help me

300
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,640
those are always really good parking

301
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,160
company attendant

302
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,160
make sure it's the right company

303
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,800
otherwise that can be a red flag

304
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,240
a lot of people like internet technician

305
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,399
it's not one of my personal favorites

306
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,880
but i see it used all the time

307
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,640
um hvac that's one of my go-to's

308
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,320
personal trainer that could be tricky

309
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,399
but but doable

310
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,000
and then security guard is tricky as

311
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,839
well and make sure that you're not

312
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,600
impersonating an official

313
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,360
police or fire or anything like that

314
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,120
that has been done people have done that

315
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,200
and they've gone to jail so

316
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,480
you want to stay clear of that sort of

317
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,320
thing um

318
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,839
even if you are a criminal i don't think

319
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,760
it would be a good idea because the

320
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,600
the cost is so high right i think if

321
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,240
you're doing this as an exercise i still

322
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,800
would not

323
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,800
do that

324
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,920
so i'm getting some connection errors

325
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,760
as i'm moving forward so if i'm lagging

326
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,959
out please just tell me in the comments

327
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,560
i think it's still good but

328
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,040
if it is lagging let me know and i'll

329
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,359
slow down a little bit

330
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,160
all right so with our pretext what we

331
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,399
really want to do

332
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,480
at the end of the day is make sure that

333
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,720
we're comfortable with our pretext

334
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,640
and make sure that that we we may have

335
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,839
that feeling that we belong

336
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,079
we should be able to walk into the

337
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,079
building very comfortable that's what a

338
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,439
good social engineer will achieve that

339
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:21,199
level of comfort and not only that but

340
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,399
the level of um almost invisibility so i

341
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,320
should be able to walk in there and

342
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,320
you're not going to look at me like

343
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,079
who's that and and what are they doing

344
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,640
so i almost that gray man

345
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,359
sort of of feel right so i can kind of

346
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,120
walk past

347
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,399
people without drawing a lot of

348
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
attention i mean you could go the other

349
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,920
way

350
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,720
and get a lot of attention just to look

351
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,160
more

352
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,720
like you belong but i wouldn't recommend

353
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,800
that it's too high risk some pretex

354
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,560
if you get caught a lot of people in the

355
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,279
social engineering world will

356
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,239
say if you get caught just keep with the

357
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,519
same pretext

358
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,839
even when they're putting the handcuffs

359
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,760
on just stay with the same pretext

360
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,200
i don't really believe that i think that

361
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,880
you can evolve

362
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,320
one of my favorites that i've always

363
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,040
wanted to do is

364
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,120
congratulate people and say hey

365
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,319
congratulations you caught me

366
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,560
because that makes people feel good

367
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,160
right and that's the whole objective of

368
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,239
social engineering is to make people

369
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,639
feel good and happy have that

370
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,320
um that dialogue right so hey

371
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,360
congratulations you caught me

372
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,880
i'm here to to test your defenses

373
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,800
can you help help me get to the next

374
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,160
level and tell me how to open that door

375
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,839
or or something like that right like

376
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,680
bring them into it if you want

377
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,680
and i think that would work on other

378
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,040
ctfs like the scctf

379
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,199
as well um so that's if you ever

380
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,199
have done that let me know because it's

381
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,680
one of my favorites i'd always like to

382
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,600
evolve that property management i think

383
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,199
that's quite often a good one unless you

384
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,880
run into property management

385
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,880
locksmith that that's really i think

386
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,920
quite a good one because the

387
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,000
the the risk there is much lower

388
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,519
locked out of my office that's higher

389
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
risk because they may say well no that's

390
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,160
not your office i've had that happen

391
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,720
um on phone calls before and then just a

392
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,120
random

393
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,880
employee just fumbling around could work

394
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,639
too

395
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,240
so those are those are some but of

396
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,639
course your knowledge is going to vary

397
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,639
so pick ones that work for you

398
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,160
now we're on site we've done all of our

399
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,959
research on site

400
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,639
uh we're showing up to the building and

401
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,518
we want to kind of case the building out

402
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,000
see if our research is still accurate

403
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,600
right so

404
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,279
that classic saying trust but verify

405
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,800
right so we want to trust our research

406
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,560
but verify that it's still correct

407
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,479
because they may have made changes

408
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,319
there may be construction there may be

409
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,079
new cctv cameras

410
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,240
and we want to be very careful that we

411
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,800
don't expose ourselves

412
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,680
um to those cameras before we even even

413
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,000
start

414
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,279
and i think that as far as defenses on

415
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,040
your building

416
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,439
real criminals when they're doing their

417
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,959
reconnaissance as little as they may do

418
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,480
they're going to be conscious of that so

419
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,479
when they see the camera

420
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,000
fake or real they're going to have a

421
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,720
reaction to that

422
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,560
uh so i think that's as far as layering

423
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,600
your defenses go cameras are an

424
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,638
excellent option

425
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,959
of course you want to make sure you're

426
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,959
covering certain areas with it of course

427
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,199
so what i'm going to look for when i

428
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,319
arrive on site of course what's changed

429
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,719
what's the same

430
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,560
are there guards door locks if i can

431
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,519
take a look at the door locks and get

432
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,839
close enough

433
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,000
for that without a camera capturing me

434
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,880
or if i can hide myself my face when i'm

435
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,480
looking at that

436
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,800
that's really what i want to try to do

437
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,240
is get in there take a look a close look

438
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
at those locks

439
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,440
that's going to tell me what level i'm

440
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,959
going to do am i going to do just lock

441
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
picking or am i going to just bust the

442
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,079
door

443
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,920
and the lock any sort of man traps i

444
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,920
want to try to avoid all of those

445
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,199
if i can i'll take a look at the back

446
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,880
door is that an easier

447
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,319
option any new opportunities as well so

448
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,000
we talked about new risk

449
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,920
but there could be new opportunities so

450
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,720
construction could be a great new

451
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,519
opportunity

452
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,120
usually there's a lot of chaos there so

453
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,000
things like that i definitely want to

454
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,240
want to take a look at now the front

455
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,800
door this is the most obvious choice

456
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,480
uh for an attack however it is also the

457
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,359
most complex

458
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,839
and so because our operation is going to

459
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,440
be quite

460
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,720
lengthy we're going quite deep into the

461
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,040
building and we're going really into the

462
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,760
most

463
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,160
one of the most risky areas we probably

464
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,199
want to be as stealthy as possible when

465
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,279
we go in

466
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,560
and real attackers will often do this as

467
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,720
well unless

468
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,839
there's very few people in the building

469
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,839
and the risk of

470
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,639
noise and destruction is low but

471
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,160
initially especially

472
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,320
as i'm going through the first layers of

473
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,199
a defense i kind of want to test it out

474
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,519
so if i do get

475
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,599
caught i haven't broken anything i'm not

476
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,680
i'm not liable so i can just say oh

477
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
sorry wrong building i was looking for

478
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,160
my doctor's office right

479
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,000
so i usually want to be more stealthy at

480
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,719
least initially

481
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,480
front doors usually are very difficult

482
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,000
highest level of surveillance

483
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,959
man traps active guards receptionists

484
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,040
um forced interaction quite often which

485
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,359
which is difficult so they could ask you

486
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,800
oh excuse me can i help you and and

487
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,000
really good companies with a good

488
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,439
security culture

489
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
will do that they'll train their

490
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,839
receptionists to uh do that sort of

491
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,720
thing to make interaction to make eye

492
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,079
contact

493
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,720
if the people come in the building don't

494
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,000
make eye contact that can be a red flag

495
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,519
especially if you don't recognize them

496
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,680
of course if you recognize them as a

497
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,120
standard employee that's different but

498
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,319
um yeah so front door is often difficult

499
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,320
one of the things that i think would be

500
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,560
this is more of a sophisticated attack

501
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,000
for attackers but i think it has so much

502
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,800
potential

503
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,160
with the cloning of cards if i can clone

504
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,160
a card

505
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,600
i can basically walk in like i own the

506
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,199
place because now i do

507
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,279
i i can put in this device this esp key

508
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,120
i walk up to the card scanner especially

509
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,680
if it's on the outside

510
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,680
and put in put on my shirt that says i'm

511
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,680
the the card manufacturer

512
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,599
i'm swapping out the batteries have

513
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,959
somebody with a clipboard standing over

514
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,040
me making sure i'm doing everything

515
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,199
correctly five minute job

516
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,800
plug this in now it's sending your creds

517
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,359
to my phone in the parking lot

518
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,079
i collect everything and now i can walk

519
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,199
in as

520
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,959
anybody with that card so uh much more

521
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,480
sophisticated for than your average

522
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,559
attacker would do

523
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,000
but if security is high on your list

524
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,160
especially physical security i would

525
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,160
make sure you've got the tamper alarms

526
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,280
on these devices so that if people try

527
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,039
to go do this

528
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,559
um they're not taking everything from

529
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,559
you so uh

530
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,639
i found from my research not many of

531
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,839
these do so 99

532
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,839
so that that's not good

533
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,000
all right front door don't have the

534
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,880
access card you're gonna walk in with

535
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,200
social engineering

536
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,520
passive entry method this dude is

537
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,760
awesome right he's got a big smile

538
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,360
so friendly you know you're gonna say

539
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,039
good morning to this guy as he walks

540
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,959
through hey can i help you with the door

541
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,280
he's all loaded up with stuff right

542
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,200
that's great he's got his tool belt

543
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,039
right which makes him look legitimate

544
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,240
but also it's a great place to put your

545
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,080
forced entry tools

546
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,600
so you've got everything so it doesn't

547
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,280
look like you're carrying this big bag

548
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,600
of criminal intent right

549
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,960
it's really i'm just a legit guy trying

550
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,559
to do some work

551
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,120
um so so good in so many ways

552
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,960
and uh so yeah being able to carry your

553
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,520
your tools in there so now you're ready

554
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,039
you're all set up for that forced entry

555
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,039
should you need to use it

556
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,799
now covert entry mode on front doors

557
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,000
this door

558
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,080
you can see it kind of on the bottom

559
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,400
half of this image this this type of

560
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,120
door lock is very popular in warmer

561
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,280
climates

562
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,199
you see it all over the place but of

563
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,080
course there's a tool for that which can

564
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,799
quickly allow you to open that you can

565
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,240
fix the door

566
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,480
so that it won't do that which i would

567
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,280
highly recommend because this door

568
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,320
to open it is about 30 seconds if that

569
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,399
if you know what you're doing and this

570
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,240
tool is super easy to use

571
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,919
a lot of people that's their front door

572
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,200
and once you're past that you usually

573
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,280
have entry to

574
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,559
a lot of other stuff so i highly

575
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,520
recommend if you're in the physical

576
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,200
security area

577
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,879
or responsibility for your company take

578
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,679
a look at those

579
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,679
super easy minimal time

580
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,160
all right forced entry mode for the

581
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,439
front door and

582
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,360
these are the first responder

583
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
boxes that you will sometimes see

584
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,719
they're usually put in a place where you

585
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,440
wouldn't necessarily look

586
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,640
but this basically just like cloning a

587
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,360
card will give you

588
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,320
god mode to your building inside these

589
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,280
boxes

590
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,200
are every lock for your building because

591
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,440
they're designed for firemen to open

592
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,880
and if there's a fire to use to go

593
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,480
through your building

594
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,320
so if you are responsible for the

595
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,679
security physical security in your

596
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,760
building you may want to talk to the

597
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,160
property management about these boxes

598
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,280
and see

599
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,760
what they do actually contain uh because

600
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,360
if i

601
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,360
break this open which is totally

602
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,719
possible if i can find it most people

603
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,039
don't know what these are so the risk

604
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,679
for real criminals is fairly low

605
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,240
but they're uh but they're once you get

606
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,080
it

607
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,080
you have god mode so find out what's in

608
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,678
the box what they have access to

609
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,280
maybe they don't need access to your

610
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,600
data center right maybe they don't need

611
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,520
access to the executive floor

612
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,678
so there's some things there once i get

613
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,360
this sure there might be an alarm

614
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,720
on your building but if every employee

615
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,479
has the code i'm going to guess one of

616
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,760
those common codes are going to work

617
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,320
and i'm all set right so something to

618
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,320
look into

619
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,479
now you'll see that these come in

620
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,840
several different forms depending on

621
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,760
what country you're in

622
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,120
i've got some other examples there and

623
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,679
there's a great presentation

624
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,479
specifically on this from the rsa

625
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,520
conference

626
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,080
2013 uh where he goes through these a

627
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,559
little bit

628
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,360
more but um these are a real risk

629
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,639
luckily not

630
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,399
many people know about them but they're

631
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,520
coming becoming more popular since

632
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,960
2013. so definitely take a look

633
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,120
at that now we're going to get into

634
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,559
some of the forced entry tools that

635
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,520
would be used and some of these are used

636
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,520
by criminals

637
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,200
they will be modified and simplified by

638
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,320
criminals and of course the

639
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,880
the time taken to use these as well is

640
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,879
going to be

641
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,960
longer so and i'm going to show you how

642
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,280
long it takes to use some of these tools

643
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,039
the classic wedge this is usually made

644
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,200
out of aluminum it's lightweight it's

645
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,600
got the holes to reduce the weight

646
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,320
but it's a critical tool and it's quite

647
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,840
often sometimes

648
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,678
criminals will use a rock or whatever

649
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,760
they can find from opportunity

650
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,120
to do this but it basically used to jam

651
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,440
into a door

652
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,719
or window or any entry point to make

653
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,960
space so you can then

654
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,960
leverage more so if you see one of these

655
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,720
things line outside of your building

656
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,559
or something similar you probably want

657
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,039
to remove it so one of the things you

658
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,879
can do for

659
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,320
physical security is not only do

660
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,320
surveillance around your

661
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,320
building but just do a walk around once

662
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,840
in a while and see what kind of debris

663
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,240
is out there you don't want things like

664
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,320
this

665
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,480
lying around outside because criminals

666
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,879
will will just pick them up and use them

667
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,240
um part of the part of the fireman's kit

668
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,000
and first responders kit

669
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,000
um and they're they're a great tool

670
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,480
uh wire cutters so wire cutters um or

671
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,440
side cutters sometimes used

672
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,559
are called um great for cutting wire so

673
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,600
if you have a fence we could

674
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,760
cut that but also for steering the

675
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,080
nails or screws that are sometimes used

676
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,080
in a door so they're multi-purpose

677
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,520
highly effective a lot of leverage with

678
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,720
those i can also use them as a poor

679
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,879
man's wedge

680
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,760
as well so if you see these lying around

681
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,760
that's a bad sign

682
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,039
uh this is a little bit more interesting

683
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
right if you see this in someone's tool

684
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,120
belt

685
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,720
that's uh going to be more of a tell

686
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,600
than just wire cutters wire cutters look

687
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,600
fairly benign but these are modified

688
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,520
channel lock pliers and the beautiful

689
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,439
thing about these is

690
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,120
you now have a multi-tool three

691
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,080
different tools in one

692
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,080
the classic usage of this tool is to

693
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,559
simply remove your lock that

694
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,520
mortise lock that i have a picture of on

695
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,240
the left there

696
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,960
i can just unscrew that with this tool

697
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,480
pop it out

698
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,559
your door opens uh very quick to do

699
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,000
and a lot of front doors will have that

700
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,678
and so you may want to take take

701
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,120
a look at that make sure it's not your

702
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,440
only line of defense

703
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:04,080
right this tool you're probably

704
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,840
fairly familiar with the shove knife uh

705
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,199
this is very common

706
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,120
if you go to conferences you can quite

707
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,640
often buy this it's

708
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,080
i'm not going to go too deep into it

709
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,159
because i think the lock picking

710
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,199
community has a fairly good familiarity

711
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,440
with it

712
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,200
but it is a great tool to have because

713
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,600
it will solve a lot of your problems

714
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,480
with

715
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,918
locked doors unfortunately uh you can

716
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,039
use it many different ways depending on

717
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,679
the type of

718
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,480
of door handle that you're dealing with

719
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,919
but

720
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,679
a great tool to have if you want to play

721
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,960
with lock picking this tool is a great

722
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,120
thing to practice

723
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,159
because it is such a common problem

724
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,158
solver with doors

725
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,440
now we're getting into more of the

726
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,320
harder core first responder forced entry

727
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,360
tools

728
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,158
this called a roof hook it's quite a

729
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,479
long tool

730
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,000
it gives you a lot of leverage it gives

731
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,600
you multiple

732
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,880
tools in one chiseling smashing

733
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,799
um it's like a lever action it's a very

734
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,679
sophisticated tool so don't expect real

735
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,440
attackers to

736
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,840
use this very much there's other tools

737
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,840
that are better the standard crowbar

738
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,279
is probably used more by just common

739
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,480
attackers but

740
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,360
this one's a little bit more

741
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,159
sophisticated

742
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,158
this tool here is my personal favorite

743
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,279
it's a shorter tool than the previous

744
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,799
one this pro bar or

745
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:25,200
often called the haligan it's very

746
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,840
common among firefighters because it is

747
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,640
highly effective in the hands of the

748
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,639
right person

749
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,039
this tool can basically help you move

750
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,360
through almost any door

751
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,559
in it usually in seconds sometimes

752
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,600
minutes right

753
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,200
so it gives you incredible leverage the

754
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,719
different points on this tool can allow

755
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,200
you to pop hinges

756
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,400
to remove rivets to do all sorts of

757
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,120
amazing things

758
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,120
very quickly

759
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,320
so now we're going to take a look at the

760
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,520
back door those are some quick tools and

761
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,360
i'm going to talk about how to use them

762
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,039
as well as we proceed through but

763
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,879
now let's take a look at that back door

764
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,440
real quick so the back doors are quite

765
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,799
often

766
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,640
great for attackers usually it's

767
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,000
if you've got a loading dock that's

768
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,679
usually wide open

769
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,679
there's usually people out there

770
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,200
relaxing not really relaxing but taking

771
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,279
breaks sometimes

772
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,120
and uh and just moving things around a

773
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,960
little bit of chaos is great for an

774
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,320
attacker to kind of move through

775
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,480
one of the things to watch out for as an

776
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,600
attacker is if there's people that are

777
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,919
diligent on

778
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,600
safety uh usually it's less security and

779
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,320
more safety right hey are you wearing a

780
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,399
hard hat

781
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,320
hey are those steel toed boots right

782
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,520
especially in a union environment or

783
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,039
something like that you could definitely

784
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,799
see some of that going on so if an

785
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,559
attacker is going to move through here

786
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,960
it can be difficult if they're not

787
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,799
dressed in the right attire

788
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,400
with that sort of thing but it also

789
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,400
makes a great egress

790
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,320
option right so if attackers are coming

791
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,360
out that could be a place they would

792
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,600
want to exit from

793
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,439
because moving past that is going to be

794
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:58,320
actually easier than going in for sure

795
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,919
uh back doors so um quite often back

796
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,678
doors are overlooked a little bit right

797
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,360
they're usually an exit point not always

798
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,520
an entry point so

799
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,439
uh it could be a place for a forced

800
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,520
entry or a better option for covert

801
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,640
entry of course lock picking

802
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,080
um you know it usually avoids man traps

803
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,360
as well guards and reception

804
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,158
is usually not stationed there uh

805
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,520
and then also it offers a good egress

806
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,320
point as well right so if i want to get

807
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,918
out

808
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,279
um that's a good idea if i'm coming

809
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,760
in through that through social

810
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,960
engineering um i could do that if people

811
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,640
are having a smoke break

812
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,240
but it doesn't really legitimize my

813
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,200
pretext as much as

814
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,720
coming through the front doorwood um so

815
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,360
if you have success coming in

816
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,360
that way you could leave that way so

817
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,039
steel doors quite often attackers will

818
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,799
see steel doors there or you may use

819
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,879
steel doors in your business

820
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,320
um on this particular case i know that

821
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,279
picture's a bit hard to see it's quite

822
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,678
small

823
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,039
but it looks fairly secure right it

824
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,200
looks not too bad

825
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,879
uh that can be breached in about two

826
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,279
minutes so in two minutes is not a long

827
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,799
time right two minutes of

828
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,720
it's gonna involve a little bit of noise

829
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,200
but but two minutes is pretty quick

830
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,559
right

831
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,760
for a kind of run-of-the-mill um

832
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,760
criminal i think it's going to take more

833
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,559
than two minutes of course but still not

834
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,720
that long

835
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,320
if they have a crowbar and they kind of

836
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,880
know what they're they're doing

837
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,600
uh two-man team definitely within two

838
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,640
minutes

839
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,279
with professionals there's no deadbolts

840
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,000
there's no uh no sophistication there

841
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,000
other than just the steel door

842
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,600
a lot of people will say hey rob attack

843
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
the hinges

844
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,279
yeah you can some people will and this

845
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,559
tool is great for that it's a

846
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,799
spring-loaded tool

847
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,039
so you can pull it and release it pops

848
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,918
the idea is it pops the hinges

849
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,200
the hinge pins out uh yeah that could

850
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,000
work but what you'll find

851
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,799
is now you're attacking three different

852
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,679
areas

853
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,279
rather than just the one so hinges are

854
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,559
doable and you definitely want to secure

855
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,559
your hinges one of the things i

856
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,600
recommend are stud hinges

857
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,360
um especially on your outside perimeter

858
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,120
that's a quick and easy option that you

859
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,080
can do that will prevent a tool like

860
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,158
this from

861
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,439
from breaking your hinges definitely

862
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,919
take a look at that and

863
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,960
all this information is in my references

864
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,559
slide at the very

865
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,799
end of this so if you get my slide deck

866
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,279
you can find out where to buy this tool

867
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,360
or the stud hinges and things like that

868
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,760
but uh i find going after the lock

869
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,799
is quite often a better option and also

870
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,480
if you break the hinges it's

871
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,840
non-reversible so when someone sees the

872
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,520
door on the ground

873
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,959
uh that's going to be a pretty clear

874
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,240
tell that somebody's broken into the

875
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,640
building so

876
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,720
for more covert entry not necessarily

877
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,559
recommended

878
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,760
more back doors so look at this door

879
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,600
right you've got the

880
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,760
the lock the key lock you've also got a

881
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,000
padlock and then you've got those studs

882
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,158
in the door and those studs represent an

883
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,720
arm that is behind the door quite often

884
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,480
it's a wood 2x4 or something like that

885
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,840
and this offers a little bit more

886
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,279
challenge right because now you may be

887
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,399
thinking well rob now i'm going to go

888
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,360
for the hinges

889
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,000
because now it's so secure not

890
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,000
necessarily

891
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,760
the case right so for example that

892
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,200
padlock about five seconds

893
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,799
and i'm gonna show you how to do that

894
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,720
the uh studs

895
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,158
again just you can either shear those

896
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,919
off with your side cutters

897
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,399
or pop them out with your hail again

898
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,159
just bash them through um

899
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,879
and then that that lock can be removed

900
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,600
with your um with your vice grips right

901
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,159
so not that difficult still i mean much

902
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,320
more

903
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,200
of a deterrent for your street criminals

904
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,840
for sure

905
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,679
and i think this would be a recommended

906
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,720
perimeter back door for sure because

907
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,080
criminals are going to look at that go

908
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,120
yeah maybe not

909
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,600
but but not not totally safe this shows

910
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,959
you

911
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,360
the aftermath of that right so

912
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,399
cutting the deadbolt or popping it uh

913
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,399
the work arm

914
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,439
can discard that once you pop those and

915
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,719
it doesn't actually show that

916
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,080
those but those um studs or rivets there

917
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,480
you just pop those through or grind them

918
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,760
off

919
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,840
so that's about six minutes with a

920
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,640
two-man team um so a little longer

921
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,720
you've definitely

922
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,559
made some time there and adding more

923
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,000
time is good because the noise is going

924
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:02,320
to be heard hopefully by other people

925
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,360
now for anybody who's watched no country

926
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,678
for old men

927
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,520
this is kind of the over-the-counter

928
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,880
equivalent of that tool if you haven't

929
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,559
watched that show and you're interested

930
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,399
in physical security

931
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,158
the show is a bit gory okay there's some

932
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,080
violence in the show so

933
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,600
extreme violence so if you're not into

934
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,000
that don't watch it but

935
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,279
uh the tool that he is carrying is it's

936
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,200
a multi-purpose tool

937
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,279
unfortunately but one of the purposes

938
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,399
that it's used for is removing locks off

939
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,120
of doors it does it

940
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:31,279
very quickly the tool on the left you

941
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,520
can buy for 230

942
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,120
american i think it is uh might be

943
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,840
canadian um

944
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,439
and and it's a and it's very quick and

945
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,120
it's not very loud if you're familiar

946
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,520
with lockpick lawyer you can go to

947
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,959
his website or his youtube channel it's

948
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,200
amazing anything to do with

949
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,279
breaking locks or lock picking fantastic

950
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,880
resources in my resources page

951
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,640
but this you could put it in your belt

952
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,679
loop walk up to a padlock

953
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,840
boom it's open and uh it is will it will

954
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,120
be a little bit loud because it takes a

955
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,720
a 22 shell or a 0.27 round shell uh to

956
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,678
open it but it will open any lock

957
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,480
basically right so pretty pretty amazing

958
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,559
then you can just buy it over the

959
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,600
counter

960
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,960
now you're in the lobby you've gotten

961
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,080
past the first perimeter you're in the

962
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,399
lobby and

963
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,918
um you're looking at what it's going to

964
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,879
offer you so we want to watch out for

965
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,120
these things

966
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,399
any sort of physical barriers alarms

967
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,439
security guards

968
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,120
be ready for that because you're

969
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,399
probably going to see it in the lobby if

970
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,239
you don't have that in your lobby you

971
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,760
probably want to look at that

972
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,919
when you're in the lobby you either want

973
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,000
to be extremely comfortable

974
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,399
or not comfortable and just avoid the

975
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,679
lobby and find an alternate

976
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,719
ingress point like the back door

977
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,720
now we're in the hallway we've

978
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,360
progressed we're in the building further

979
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,679
in

980
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,719
and the hallways are great i find

981
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,200
because

982
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,760
they're secluded usually but it's a man

983
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,440
trap

984
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,440
so if someone stops me in the hallway i

985
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,360
only have ford and back to go

986
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,440
so i love the mirrors that are sometimes

987
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,639
in the corner of hallways so you can see

988
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,320
people in the hallway

989
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,919
those are a great tool to have so you

990
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,840
can see if people are lingering or

991
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,760
hiding in a hallway

992
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,959
attackers quite often will walk with

993
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
purpose because they don't want you to

994
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,519
stop them

995
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,799
so if somebody's blaring away on their

996
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,320
phone you know that could be a pretext

997
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,918
if they're not making eye contact with

998
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,960
you if you don't recognize them that's

999
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,880
another sign

1000
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,320
so if i see somebody in my building that

1001
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,519
i don't recognize i will say

1002
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,039
hi really loud hi uh and if they don't

1003
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,440
look up i'm gonna walk in front of them

1004
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,480
and say hey are you new hey i'm rob

1005
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,480
nice to meet you and i'm just gonna be

1006
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,559
obnoxious right because i want to make

1007
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,080
sure that they are actually an employee

1008
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,399
and if they're a new employee and i'm

1009
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,000
this obnoxious you know super happy

1010
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,600
person welcoming them to the company

1011
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,559
that's not a bad thing right that's

1012
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,240
that's kind of a good thing but if

1013
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,639
they're a criminal you know at least i'm

1014
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,080
going to discover that as well so

1015
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,440
that's a technique you can you can use

1016
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,199
elevator i'm in the elevator there's

1017
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,440
some great presentations that are

1018
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,039
strictly focused on the elevator

1019
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,640
i highly recommend you to go take a look

1020
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,360
at those i'm not going to go deep into

1021
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,279
this but

1022
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,559
if you learn just a little bit about

1023
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,120
elevators um

1024
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,480
and criminals could do this quite easily

1025
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,639
you could just camp in the elevator put

1026
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,240
it out of sight at a border sign on it

1027
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,000
walk in sit there until the business is

1028
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,240
closed then come out you know when

1029
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,799
everybody's gone home

1030
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,640
there's some great videos on that i

1031
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,720
don't see criminals doing that very much

1032
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,000
but it is a great option and i would

1033
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,279
anticipate as people get more

1034
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,480
sophisticated to do that

1035
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:25,039
more stairs

1036
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,600
uh less people use the stairs because

1037
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,519
it's

1038
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,918
harder right so you'll find less people

1039
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,279
in there criminals like to use stairs

1040
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,960
of all the criminal activity that i've

1041
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,600
seen especially for stolen

1042
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,399
uh stolen equipment they use the stairs

1043
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,959
they don't want to get caught in the

1044
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,158
elevator

1045
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,320
so they'll run down the stairs

1046
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,399
especially as especially to get out

1047
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,799
right so having cameras in the stairs

1048
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,120
this is a high opportunity area for

1049
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,720
criminal activity as well violence as

1050
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,840
well so having

1051
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,159
having cameras in the staircase is

1052
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,600
recommended uh

1053
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,120
clone cards if you have your clone card

1054
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,480
of course you use the stairs as well

1055
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,120
it's going to help you get through

1056
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,120
all the doors

1057
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,879
now we're in the executive office now

1058
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,320
this

1059
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,240
is interesting right because usually an

1060
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,639
executive office is almost like a whole

1061
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,678
different kind of sub environment from

1062
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,440
the rest of the building

1063
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,280
you're going to have probably fancier

1064
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,399
higher quality equipment

1065
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,159
now we're going to try to get into the

1066
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,199
filing cabinet i'm going to anticipate

1067
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,639
that that's going to be

1068
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,638
not just a run-of-the-mill filing

1069
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,200
cabinet that may be actually

1070
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,240
a more high-grade more secure filing

1071
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,078
cabinet

1072
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,839
and i'm at a higher risk now so

1073
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,440
criminals will be very careful

1074
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,799
when they're in this sort of area

1075
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,079
because they know their exposure level

1076
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,919
is extremely high

1077
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,280
so they're either going to be very quick

1078
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,040
or they're going to be very careful

1079
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,760
probably both right but if i don't have

1080
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,560
a solid pretext if i'm not in uniform or

1081
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,599
a pretext outfit then i'm going to be

1082
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,879
very uncomfortable

1083
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,520
in this environment so i'm going to be

1084
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,440
as fast as possible um i'm also going to

1085
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,119
try to avoid detection so closing the

1086
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,560
the blinds closing the door

1087
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,560
doing all those things if i need to be

1088
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,400
in there for a prolonged period of time

1089
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,599
so um also if they get caught they're

1090
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,040
going to be thinking about that right if

1091
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,280
i get caught what am i going to say

1092
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,880
so they may sound initially smooth if

1093
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,560
you catch them in there

1094
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,000
because they're going to be thinking i'm

1095
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,320
probably going to get caught if i'm in

1096
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,800
here

1097
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,800
too long

1098
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,480
the filing cabinet not very secure right

1099
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,400
most of the time you just pop this open

1100
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,359
with a nail clip or filing cabinet to

1101
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,920
the lock

1102
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,440
uh it's not don't don't think that your

1103
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,000
stuff is secure if you've locked it in

1104
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,680
there

1105
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,800
you can turn it upside down again that's

1106
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,359
going to make some noise and be

1107
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,520
difficult

1108
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,200
if it's heavy but there's usually a push

1109
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,200
rod that you can activate

1110
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,799
uh if all of those things don't work you

1111
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,160
can just drill the lock of course if

1112
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,280
you've got time and you don't mind the

1113
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,839
noise

1114
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,200
uh bump key i love bump keys so you

1115
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,799
could look into that as well

1116
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,799
but uh drilling or impact is going to be

1117
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,480
your your last line of defense there

1118
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,680
you could technically just pry bar the

1119
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,359
drawers open but that's going to be

1120
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,480
really messy and probably even more time

1121
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,560
consuming as well

1122
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,960
so um yeah so watch out for that i think

1123
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,240
that

1124
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,119
um that i would often in a in an

1125
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,720
executive office

1126
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,800
just take a look for the key in the

1127
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,640
office and look around

1128
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,800
uh quite often you'll find probably in

1129
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,839
the first drawer so

1130
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,839
watch out for that

1131
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,040
all right now we finally got into the

1132
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,119
filing cabinet

1133
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,560
uh we've picked it up and uh now we're

1134
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,040
ready to get out of there and

1135
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,480
this could be any sort of um criminal

1136
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,960
objective so maybe

1137
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,920
i am picking up laptops this is one case

1138
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,480
that i had where

1139
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,400
a criminal was walking into the premise

1140
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,920
uh going to various floors

1141
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,079
uh just shadowing people into the

1142
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,680
secure area just walking in behind as

1143
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,440
they opened the door with their card

1144
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,279
and they would pick up laptops and put

1145
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,520
them in their back of their pants

1146
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,640
or in a carry bag that they had and then

1147
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,920
they would just casually

1148
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,520
walk out right but so initially they

1149
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,119
have low risk when they're in and as

1150
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,359
attacker you're thinking okay well

1151
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,800
i haven't done anything necessarily bad

1152
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,160
yet maybe they're all the way to the

1153
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,680
executive office

1154
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,839
have they really committed a crime other

1155
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,440
than say trespass which is very hard to

1156
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,680
prosecute

1157
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,960
until they actually do the crime so if

1158
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,359
they break something

1159
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,720
that that's going to be a crime if they

1160
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,359
if they pick something up and try to

1161
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,959
steal it

1162
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,240
that's going to be a crime as well but

1163
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,200
you know again you have to you have to

1164
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,560
prove that

1165
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,960
so those are the two kind of things

1166
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,640
you're looking for so once they actually

1167
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,640
pick something up now it's all about

1168
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,279
escape and evade

1169
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,640
and avoiding detection but also just not

1170
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,880
being detained

1171
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,720
um so some of the things you want to

1172
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,680
look out for

1173
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,799
are are doors being left ajar so why is

1174
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,720
that door open

1175
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,240
why is there a chair oh leaving that

1176
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,720
door open one other thing you want to

1177
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,439
look out for which is harder to detect

1178
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,560
is if people put tape or block of the

1179
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,040
door so that it just

1180
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,200
freely opens right it's hard to see that

1181
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,520
the door will close it looks normal

1182
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,040
so if you have an alarm on your doors to

1183
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,160
detect that that's probably the easiest

1184
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,160
thing to do

1185
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,240
or auto locking doors that are carded of

1186
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,000
course that that's good as well

1187
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,200
but that's what they're going to want to

1188
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,040
do they're going to want to escape as

1189
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,480
quickly as possible

1190
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,560
some of the things that they can do is

1191
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,359
the fire alarm that's a very mean trick

1192
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,000
to do

1193
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,200
uh but it it is done so they pull the

1194
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,280
fire alarm everybody

1195
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,799
rushes out of the building well they

1196
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,200
don't necessarily rush these days but

1197
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,640
they're

1198
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:21,598
they're leaving on mass uh first aid

1199
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,279
any sort of first aid um alarm so maybe

1200
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,400
there's a call that somebody's having a

1201
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,520
first aid problem

1202
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,920
that's gonna cause panic and um yeah

1203
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,079
again

1204
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,480
don't do a pretext if you're doing it as

1205
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,760
a exercise as firemen or law enforcement

1206
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,359
or first aid you'll get yourself in a

1207
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,960
lot of trouble with that

1208
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,799
uh they'll want to move with the crowd

1209
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,800
if possible so um

1210
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,400
especially in the lobby area if there's

1211
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,960
a security guard there or anything like

1212
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,160
that

1213
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,079
they're going to want to try to hide

1214
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,000
themselves within the crowd

1215
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,160
as much as possible not only does it put

1216
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,760
them put a barrier between them and the

1217
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,598
security guard which is what they want

1218
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,640
but it also kind of blurs them out as

1219
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,640
they proceed through

1220
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,920
yeah back of the head to the cctv

1221
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,160
reduces forensics

1222
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,560
risk so they will be conscious of their

1223
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,960
face being on camera so they will try to

1224
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,040
guard

1225
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,640
that so the hoodie over the face the

1226
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,720
ball cap covering the face

1227
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,720
the hand over the face right anything

1228
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,200
that covers your face

1229
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,640
when law enforcement is doing forensics

1230
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,598
on that they're going to want to see the

1231
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,000
face

1232
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,720
even depending on the location that you

1233
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,200
live in

1234
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,000
even if police have video evidence of

1235
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,319
the face

1236
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,400
that does not guarantee you uh uh

1237
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,800
criminal prosecution or arrest

1238
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,320
uh so so keep that in mind um many

1239
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,720
people have been disappointed with that

1240
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,240
so um the other thing to think about is

1241
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,959
a lot of criminal activity

1242
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,959
will be by criminals that are not

1243
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,359
necessarily living in a

1244
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,079
a permanent structure so they may be

1245
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,920
transient

1246
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,280
so you law enforcement may have a very

1247
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,599
difficult time even with a

1248
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,960
positive video id actually finding that

1249
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,640
person right so

1250
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,200
keep that in mind um they also may drop

1251
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,598
stuff

1252
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,799
on the way out and this this is very

1253
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,880
common so if they are

1254
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,079
if this is a crime of opportunity they

1255
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,079
may use a crowbar

1256
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,599
to break in but then as they're coming

1257
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,800
out maybe they don't want people to see

1258
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,079
them carrying a crowbar

1259
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,839
now that they've got ten thousand

1260
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,599
dollars worth of electronics in their

1261
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,880
pants and their in their backpack and

1262
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,440
things like that so

1263
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,319
you wanna on a regular basis check those

1264
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,800
areas

1265
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,720
bathrooms are a great place um for

1266
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,680
criminals to seek refuge

1267
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,839
and also to hide things back the toilet

1268
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,440
in the roof if you've got roof tiles

1269
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,440
that's another opportunity area a little

1270
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,599
more difficult but totally doable

1271
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,680
areas like that under the desks things

1272
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,960
like that now to do a regular check

1273
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,279
of that to make sure that they don't

1274
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,319
come back and reuse those tools or those

1275
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,319
things

1276
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,359
the other thing that i often see people

1277
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,920
uh mistake

1278
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,279
is your security guards especially

1279
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,880
unarmed security guards

1280
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,800
are not necessarily going to going to

1281
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,400
detain people so

1282
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,920
a lot of times the security guards that

1283
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,280
are just kind of standing outside of the

1284
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,160
building and things like that

1285
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,920
are really just there for reconnaissance

1286
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,640
are really just there to

1287
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,040
let you know if the alarm is going off

1288
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,799
to

1289
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,119
see what's going on but they're not

1290
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,119
going to chase down people necessarily

1291
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,400
and detain them especially they usually

1292
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,000
don't have handcuffs or

1293
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,839
firearms or sorry or anything things

1294
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,800
like that that would be used to detain

1295
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,400
people

1296
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,319
and that's that's probably fine but just

1297
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,520
don't assume that they're going to do

1298
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,680
that so

1299
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,200
i've had occasions where um that was the

1300
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,399
assumption and people are disappointed

1301
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,839
so

1302
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,359
yeah now you've escaped okay so you've

1303
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,520
escaped you've escaped with

1304
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,560
um that and you're safe back out on the

1305
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,000
sidewalk

1306
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,560
um and uh congratulations on that

1307
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,480
i hope that's given you an idea of how

1308
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,839
attackers could use the different

1309
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,400
disciplines including

1310
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,359
forced entry i think that forced entry

1311
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,359
is often

1312
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,480
uh overlooked quite a bit because

1313
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,440
attackers are generally not

1314
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,720
sophisticated

1315
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,040
and generally it's a crime of

1316
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,399
opportunity hey i see a lot of people

1317
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,880
coming out of that building

1318
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,760
carrying laptops i could sell those

1319
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,359
laptops

1320
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,720
therefore i'm going to get it walk into

1321
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,960
the building and see if i can pick some

1322
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,959
up

1323
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,040
right if they've got some pliers some

1324
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,599
side cutters anything that provides

1325
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,319
leverage on your desk on your door

1326
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,599
whatever

1327
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,640
they're probably going to want to use

1328
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,800
that so so yeah keep that in mind i hope

1329
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,400
hopefully that was informative for you

1330
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,119
these are some of the references

1331
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,800
that i used in this uh i highly

1332
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,640
recommend if you want to dig deeper in

1333
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,200
any of these particular areas
