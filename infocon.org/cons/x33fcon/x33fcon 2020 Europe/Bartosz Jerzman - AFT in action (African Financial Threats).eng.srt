1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,040
good morning good evening everyone

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,160
hello zifikon today i'm going to take

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,880
you to africa

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,680
to talk about african financial threats

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,840
so about the

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,279
threat groups that are targeting banks

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,560
to

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,800
conduct cyber highs i just

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,560
explain you why such topic why not

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,440
another apt

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,920
topic about the cyber aspen edge

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,839
intrusions

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,840
mainly because last year

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,680
i did a big change in my life

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,399
i left the military military sector and

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,960
i joined

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,680
private sector at the international bank

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,399
and i was absolutely challenged with my

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,840
knowledge about

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,600
threat groups that are financially

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,559
motivated and my current employer is

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,239
present

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:08,158
on many international markets

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,799
globally in asia middle east and also in

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,080
africa

26
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,439
so i decided to um

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:19,119
understand more of the threats that are

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,720
coming from the that landscape

29
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,439
so today i'm taking you to kenya

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,080
where most of the of those prolific

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,119
groups

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,960
come from and will try to understand

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:36,320
their modus operandi and very unique

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,759
kill chain of intrusions um that's

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,119
connected with

36
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,119
african origin threat groups

37
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,759
so for today's agenda i prepared

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,720
following points at first we'll focus on

39
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,640
this on these

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,280
unique tactics from the past intrusions

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,799
the the so-called african kill chain

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,520
because this is quite

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,399
unique for those groups and different

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,640
from

45
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,440
um other operations globally

46
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,720
later on we'll focus on things that

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,720
differentiate

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,800
those groups who will try to understand

49
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,160
the threat landscape

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,680
and the clustering of those groups

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,319
what differentiate them and also we'll

52
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,520
talk about some history

53
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,799
and some developments of those groups

54
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,480
and the third point are two case studies

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,640
focus on analyzing the capabilities for

56
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,280
example python keyloggers

57
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,040
which are very common among those groups

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
and we're trying to understand the

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,160
origin

60
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,679
and the development of the of those

61
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,720
keyloggers

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,280
and lastly we'll try to understand the

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,280
capabilities and infrastructure

64
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,280
of the grub zone threat group

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,800
and we will focus on one of the ips that

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
is

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,680
associated with this group in 2020 and

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,800
will try to understand

69
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,000
capabilities that were projected using

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
that infrastructure

71
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:19,440
just few words about me i served

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,720
about 16 years in polish armed forces

73
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,319
i started in polish navy and

74
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,599
ended in national cyber security center

75
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,560
poland and now i'm working as a senior

76
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,798
manager for

77
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,040
cyber threat intelligence at standard

78
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,360
chartered

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,400
and probably some of you may ask

80
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,720
who traditional analyst is so

81
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,959
this is again generally somebody who

82
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,319
tries to connect the dots who tries to

83
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,319
understand

84
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:56,640
the capabilities and tries to understand

85
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:59,040
threads uh sometimes connecting the

86
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,079
uh making looking for the patterns

87
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,480
looking for the

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,239
human fingerprints that are left by

89
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,000
adversaries

90
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,400
often it is very similar to

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,480
searching for a needle in the haystack

92
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,840
sometimes you you get lost

93
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,798
in a rabbit hole but sometimes

94
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,120
when you're successful you can try to

95
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,840
find out the pattern and the pattern

96
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,040
can help you to understand those thread

97
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,840
groups and to

98
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,840
proactively track them

99
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,159
and the disclaimer for this presentation

100
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,440
is that

101
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,440
the those opinions are solely my own and

102
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,080
they do not represent my employer's

103
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,520
position and generally their

104
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,080
investigation

105
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,639
uh especially that two case studies are

106
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,520
based on

107
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:54,639
publicly available data and i have to

108
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,719
underlined the samples the clustering of

109
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,960
thread groups and the naming convention

110
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,639
is thanks to honored services

111
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,159
i will refer to this group to this

112
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,039
company

113
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,960
in several places during my presentation

114
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,840
because

115
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,919
this is the those are the people and the

116
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,239
company that inspired me

117
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,758
to that research when i decided to focus

118
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,680
on africa

119
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:25,199
it is a group of people who support

120
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,240
targeted organizations and

121
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,520
this is a they provide very unique

122
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,960
services

123
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,198
apart from incident response services

124
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,239
they are also authorized by government

125
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,840
to conduct

126
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,840
offensive actions against

127
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,599
those threat groups and many of the

128
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,800
samples many of the threat data

129
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,479
also come from those

130
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,680
offensive cyber enabled operations

131
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,800
and i have to underline here that

132
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,440
they are very brave people because they

133
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,960
are

134
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:06,160
fighting those spreads there locally

135
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,719
often with close proximity

136
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:14,880
to to the threat groups that are

137
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:18,880
um that are very dangerous that uh

138
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,680
and the risk is real for them

139
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,880
so let's begin with understanding the

140
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,479
african threat

141
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,319
kill chain because this is something

142
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,520
very unique and when

143
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:33,120
most of the cyber intrusions

144
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,159
that we know globally are conducted

145
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,319
remotely

146
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,600
often the intrusion vector is

147
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,880
spearfishing

148
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,440
so this is not the case for the

149
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,719
for the african kill chain because the

150
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,639
initial foothold

151
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,759
is gained using the rock devices that

152
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,120
are attached by

153
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,160
insiders by bribed personal disgruntled

154
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,360
disgruntled people who are instructed by

155
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,160
the

156
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,840
members of the cyber gangs to attach

157
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,160
them

158
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,039
somewhere to the network of the

159
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,080
targeted organization so actually those

160
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,280
intrusions are very targeted

161
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,800
people are instructed to to

162
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,000
attach those devices into the

163
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,720
into those networks and if you look to

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,400
the mitra

165
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,440
attack matrix there is such a technique

166
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,120
in the initial access tactic

167
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,479
it is called hardware editions but

168
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,560
if you check there there are there are

169
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,039
not many examples for example

170
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,680
there is only one thread group mentioned

171
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,360
there

172
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,400
dark vision which is a eastern european

173
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,000
tradactor associated with intrusions in

174
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,599
the

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,039
in europe against eastern european banks

176
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,930
so we can see on this example that in

177
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,240
public

178
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,360
[Music]

179
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,759
domain we don't have many examples

180
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,240
usually because um remote intrusions

181
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,599
is is actually the beauty of cyber

182
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,879
operations

183
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:14,960
um it is very useful for

184
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:18,000
espionage organizations because it is um

185
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,599
it is cheap uh the risk

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,800
of catching is is very low

187
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:28,159
and that's why so many actors

188
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,960
use those remote attacks however

189
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,200
in africa most of the most of the

190
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,559
attacks are enabled by

191
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,080
the the rock devices specially prepared

192
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:44,319
and that's the way how actors

193
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:48,800
gain access to the to the victims

194
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:52,150
so we can also say that

195
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,760
the intruders will get in so um

196
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:57,040
[Music]

197
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,640
approach um that assume bridge

198
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,000
that is very um

199
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,439
actual there and it's it means that

200
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,040
threat hunting

201
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,200
and look proactive searching for the

202
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,640
thread actor that's already operating in

203
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,640
our environment

204
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,000
is some something that should be a

205
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,839
priority

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,480
for organizations that conduct business

207
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,360
for example financial institutions that

208
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,200
are

209
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,720
present at in this region

210
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,320
the next step when the adversary

211
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,560
attaches the the laptop

212
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,240
is of course the reconnaissance and

213
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,199
probably you are interested

214
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,480
uh what kind of laptop is this so this

215
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,760
is usually the

216
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,040
laptop with windows operating system

217
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,680
with a commercially available commercial

218
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,399
of the shell

219
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,959
software for remote access tools so it

220
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,320
could be

221
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,800
for example go to my pc it could be team

222
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
viewer

223
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,560
it could be any desk so they usually

224
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,560
deploy them

225
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:10,319
very easy to install and easy to operate

226
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,359
applications for remote access control

227
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,680
with graphical interface and usually

228
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,800
those

229
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,319
insiders are trained how to

230
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,959
how to attach the laptop how to

231
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,800
troubleshoot those laptops usually have

232
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,518
uh disabled suspension or hibernation

233
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,040
mode

234
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,440
so they so they never sleep

235
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,439
when they get access and there is a

236
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,440
common control established with

237
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:41,120
a quite simple mean the next step

238
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,720
would be to go laterally and apart from

239
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,120
those common control software there is

240
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,320
also a software to scan the network

241
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,880
to crack the passwords to

242
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,440
move laterally and for example if they

243
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,000
get

244
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,880
some passwords to move laterally they

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,399
use

246
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:04,399
old good ps execs so in this case they

247
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:07,279
they do not differ from prolific groups

248
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,000
espionage groups that also use that kind

249
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,000
of software

250
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,160
and when they move laterally what else

251
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,440
they do

252
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,880
oh for reconnaissance you have also the

253
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,800
images of bloodhound

254
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,839
and cme so so the projects which are

255
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,680
open source and are fully available for

256
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,839
reconnaissance

257
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,519
and for attacking active directory

258
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,959
environments

259
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,200
and if they if they find

260
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,479
interesting stations they install

261
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,640
keyloggers

262
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,519
this is also something very typical for

263
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,880
them

264
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,440
i uh use that citation from phineas

265
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,720
fisher

266
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,480
another threat actor that the reality is

267
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,040
that mimi cards and kilograms

268
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,680
view all passwords equally and that's

269
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,800
true

270
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,800
so they usually they do not focus

271
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,479
on dumping passwords and

272
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,160
those kinds of techniques they usually

273
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,279
deploy keyloggers

274
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,079
and we'll focus on some details of those

275
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,439
keyloggers

276
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:14,638
later on during the case studies and

277
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,720
those keyloggers are very popular uh

278
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:21,920
for all the groups and and they were

279
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,200
invented years ago and with really

280
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:28,079
slight differences

281
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:31,440
in the code they are being continuously

282
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:34,399
used in the intrusions so

283
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,040
finally when the actors get their

284
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,480
passwords to their critical systems

285
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,599
then they enable access

286
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,600
and they for example

287
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,519
um so so the intrusions

288
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,240
here we focus on the technical part but

289
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,279
actually

290
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,320
there is not only one insider during the

291
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,200
cyber intrusion

292
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,920
usually there are more and for example

293
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,519
other

294
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,240
insider threats could be people who are

295
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,760
um who have access to the account

296
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,360
systems and they create

297
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,760
account accounts with um and closely

298
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,360
before the intrusion begins

299
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,439
some um the atm cards for those accounts

300
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,639
are being taken out of the bank and they

301
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:27,120
are being delivered to the money mules

302
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:30,560
so um during the operations

303
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,839
uh intruders are focused to gain maximum

304
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,279
access to the critical system so they

305
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,079
can

306
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,120
allow transactions to those money bill

307
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,239
accounts

308
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,199
without the limits so there is no alerts

309
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,160
and also

310
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,519
the cash outs from the atms could be

311
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,560
done without the

312
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:54,560
limitations everything is

313
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:58,479
organized it could be like even

314
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:02,160
hundreds or tens hundreds of money meals

315
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,160
when the operators get the access

316
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,839
and the the money mills operate in

317
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,600
different regions they go to different

318
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,760
cities sometimes they cross

319
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,880
borders and they cash out the

320
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,880
money mule accounts

321
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,480
if it's really good to understand the

322
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,399
history of those

323
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,800
groups for example in 2014

324
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,240
the big cartel was formed it was called

325
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,560
fork bombo cartel

326
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,519
it was created in kasarani which is kind

327
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,319
of a

328
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,199
cyber criminal silicon valley uh it is a

329
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,480
ghetto area

330
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:42,800
of uh nairobi when there are many people

331
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,720
uh many um criminals from nigeria from

332
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,719
south africa

333
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,720
there was a man who was a former

334
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,839
policeman at dci

335
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,600
who formed this fork bomb cartel from

336
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,880
the smaller groups

337
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:01,440
and they were quite prolific for years

338
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,760
then then they split due to some arrests

339
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,360
so generally if we take the diamond

340
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,920
model for this group

341
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,360
it was a group that was operated in sf

342
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,959
east africa

343
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,480
it was created by the policeman and what

344
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,760
is very important

345
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,639
those groups are have often the

346
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,439
support of the local governments of the

347
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,839
police of the corrupted policemen

348
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,040
so it's very hard for the defenders and

349
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,360
for the targeted organizations to

350
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,639
fight those threats what kind of

351
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,279
capabilities

352
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,000
they used so they used commercial of the

353
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,040
shell

354
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,079
rats like teamviewer go to pc metasploit

355
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,680
ps empire they use cduq which is

356
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,000
a python python based

357
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,000
rat they use quasar rod which is

358
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,639
available on the github of course they

359
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,680
use the

360
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,880
python keyloggers and

361
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,399
they use insiders mostly from the ict

362
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,360
personal

363
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,199
uh and very often they use third-party

364
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,399
infrastructure for example they

365
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,920
exfiltrated

366
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:11,920
the key logging uh

367
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,199
to to gmail and the victims for example

368
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,920
banks but also

369
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:21,519
some cycles other financial institutions

370
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,199
and they were very prolific until the

371
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:28,240
arrests which happened in 2017

372
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,079
and the big cartel was arrested but many

373
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,120
of the members

374
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,599
managed to escape so

375
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,079
five smaller groups were created then

376
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,959
like silent cards grub zone

377
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,839
smaller version of fork bomb for bomba

378
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,239
group

379
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,279
the doctors and the co the telecode and

380
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,839
some of the groups

381
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,800
were fighting each other some were

382
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,000
cooperating

383
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,040
uh for example the the grab zone

384
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,759
group was uh very close

385
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,199
to the people that were connected uh

386
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,959
previously with fork bomb

387
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,438
cartel later on they some of the people

388
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:12,799
from grub zone and the old money mills

389
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,799
created the for bomber group in 2018

390
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,640
on the other hand there was silent cars

391
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,319
that was not

392
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,319
cooperating that much with

393
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,479
other groups that split with them later

394
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,879
on

395
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,919
even silent cars split to their

396
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,400
consultants

397
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,280
and their to rural shepherds and for

398
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,720
example

399
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,960
the person who created silent cards for

400
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,559
bombo cartel and the consultants is

401
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,600
still the same person

402
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,879
so he he managed to escape and created

403
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,280
next groups

404
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,840
uh consequently

405
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,879
and finally the fork bomb group was

406
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,918
terminated at the end of 2019

407
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,919
there was there was arrest um when they

408
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,080
tried to hack one of the biggest banks

409
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,160
in eastern central europe

410
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:08,000
sorry africa and they were free also

411
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,400
it was a great operation um

412
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,039
from the defenders perspective but also

413
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,280
it was

414
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,520
quite a big event for the attackers

415
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,399
because because they even joined with

416
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,600
rural shepherds then and some members of

417
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,799
the rural shepherds

418
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:28,559
were also during this

419
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:31,679
police action

420
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,440
how it looks in 2020 so many nothing is

421
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,559
stable though those groups

422
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,520
are mixing with each other grabs on

423
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,399
consultants are regrouping

424
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,600
and and this is the east africa threat

425
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,919
landscape

426
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,799
however on the other ha hand we have

427
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,840
also groups

428
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,840
from west africa like corsetta and this

429
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,639
is also very interesting story

430
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,120
because um there are some links that

431
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,720
they

432
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,280
they operate with ta 505

433
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,760
which is a very prolific groups we could

434
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,879
hear

435
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,080
today vitalis presentation about the

436
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,200
cooperation between this group

437
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,199
and and lazarus so

438
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,320
always those cooperations between

439
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,000
different trade actors

440
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,559
is very interesting to to research

441
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,320
and this is the the timeline and this

442
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,480
time in this history also affected the

443
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,600
the development and the modus operandi

444
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,000
of those groups

445
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,639
and we'll show it on the example of the

446
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,640
keyloggers

447
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,600
let's let's focus on some details about

448
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,199
um some of the groups for example

449
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:47,360
silent cards uh it has lots of members

450
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,799
also east african gang and capabilities

451
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,479
again they they use um go to pc

452
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,679
any pc cdu but the new version new

453
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,160
updated version

454
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,200
and the keylogger which is called

455
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,039
landcruiser

456
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,240
land cruiser but very similar to the old

457
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,640
keyloggers of the folk bombo

458
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,960
in this case so in the case of silent

459
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,520
cars they use insiders but

460
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,480
it doesn't have to be ict personnel it

461
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,720
could be anyone

462
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,480
with access and sometimes it happened

463
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,880
that even a janitor

464
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,679
could enable an access to to those

465
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,840
groups and

466
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:28,720
connect the laptop somewhere

467
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,360
to the network they have very fast

468
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,080
operational tempo

469
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,479
they use also a lot of cloud services

470
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,000
like

471
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:42,000
exfiltrating key logging to

472
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,559
ftp drive hq to gmail

473
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,280
they have quite wide targeting for

474
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,240
example

475
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,600
not only financial institutions but also

476
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,720
insurance sector

477
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,719
also hospitals

478
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,280
the group called the consultants so the

479
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,879
next group

480
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:04,639
created by the same guy who

481
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,120
um united the fork bomb cartel

482
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,799
in their case for example apart from

483
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,918
other tools they also use

484
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:16,400
w agent another commercial

485
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,039
freely available software for remote

486
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,880
access

487
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:24,799
control and python keylogger

488
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:28,320
called coco logger they also connect the

489
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,480
creditors so whenever they use w agent

490
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,120
they have to use the infrastructure from

491
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,000
the uh

492
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,000
from this service

493
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,158
and grab zone general description but

494
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,960
later on after our case studies

495
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,960
we'll see how the grab zone cluster

496
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,000
looks in 2020

497
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:54,320
so in general they use vectors like

498
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,600
metal predator ps empire caesar red

499
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,678
rotnetter so the experiment

500
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,199
you can you see that they do not attach

501
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,280
to one of the tools

502
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,440
they experiment they mix the tools

503
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,678
probably because they want to

504
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,600
um have very low avv detection

505
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,760
they do not focus that much on some

506
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,520
obfuscations

507
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:20,320
on evading av in a technical way

508
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,200
i rather they seek for new tools that

509
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,678
are not that

510
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,960
well known that they do not have the

511
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,799
signatures

512
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,400
and we'll see it later on during the

513
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,200
case studies

514
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,520
apart from freely available rats they

515
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,039
use

516
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,039
also um commercial software for remote

517
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,320
access control like any desks

518
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,400
root sim bots and again they used the

519
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,280
keylogger so this is quite

520
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,440
common for for different groups they use

521
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,720
hail mary keylogger

522
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:54,720
and and they also target the financial

523
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,200
sector a very successful group

524
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,280
so let's go to the first case study

525
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,039
about the python keyloggers

526
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:06,559
so we'll also analyze the

527
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:09,600
the initial the origin of the keyloggers

528
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,639
from the fork bomb cartel

529
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,918
um and this is one origin there is

530
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,960
a main function probably copied and

531
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,400
pasted

532
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,880
to the original keylogger of the fork

533
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,880
bombo cartel

534
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,919
that's how you utilize

535
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,520
how you use key logging in in python

536
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,200
even the variables were not

537
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,280
changed and you could see that the same

538
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,280
variables are present

539
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,678
in different keyloggers of different

540
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,678
groups

541
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,159
some parts are also not changed and

542
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,279
are common among those key loggers for

543
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,159
example

544
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,720
the name of the file where the logs are

545
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,760
store

546
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,559
stored so all the keys that are

547
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,679
pressed by the victim is usually named

548
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,840
after the

549
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,480
user name so after the after the victim

550
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,000
username and you can see also the

551
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,720
commented section

552
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
in the green and where previously the

553
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,360
fork bomb cartel used to exfiltrate

554
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,080
those logs to gmail and

555
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,520
that's why the the name of the of the

556
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,158
cluster come from

557
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:32,480
for bombo later on that they decided to

558
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:35,840
to leave the archive with the

559
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,080
with the locked keys on the machine and

560
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,480
exfiltrated using the command control

561
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,480
channel

562
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,200
and you could see on that picture the

563
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,960
comparison between the

564
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,960
coco logger which is a

565
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,799
tool from the consultants and the land

566
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,120
cruiser which is

567
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,918
a tool used by silent cards that there

568
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,719
are many

569
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,600
similarities and uh the changes are very

570
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,760
slight

571
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,600
some parts are commented some imports

572
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,080
are commented because

573
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,760
uh they don't use them anymore or maybe

574
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,279
they experiment

575
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:17,039
with some exfiltration to ftp

576
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:19,760
but generally the the way they lock the

577
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,080
uh the keystrokes and the way they they

578
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,360
form the log they create the log

579
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:29,840
is is the same among different versions

580
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,840
of those african keyloggers

581
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,640
and those are those are common artifacts

582
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,840
that i gathered

583
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,720
for those afts though those files

584
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,120
are usually quite large because the the

585
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,840
python scripts are compiled to

586
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,399
exit files with pi installer the file

587
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,520
names are masquerading known software

588
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,000
like onenote adobe xz and they are

589
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,679
usually located by adversaries in

590
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,720
program data

591
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,640
however the logs are safe to program

592
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,840
data but they could be also located in

593
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,600
user profile

594
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,720
or all users profile and this is also

595
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,840
a good thread hunting hint that

596
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,240
often adversaries put files

597
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,760
they they use those locations as their

598
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,880
staging

599
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,799
folders and

600
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,039
this is a good also threat hunting rule

601
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,879
that you could try to detect if there

602
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,240
are any files created

603
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,520
there because usually there should be a

604
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,080
folder structure and not not single

605
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,240
files

606
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:39,360
located in the in those directories

607
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,559
and the file names are openly based on

608
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,399
the username

609
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,600
and the extensions are different it

610
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,640
could be in

611
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,760
different archives or renamed extensions

612
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,200
to some

613
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:54,080
system files like inises

614
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,520
and those keyloggers usually have iran

615
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,240
keys persistence

616
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,279
so very simple not sophisticated

617
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,559
persistence

618
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:06,000
in the registry and that's why

619
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:10,480
those keyloggers are run after every

620
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,480
reboot of the operating system

621
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,720
um is it possible to easily detect

622
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,440
such keyloggers usually not because

623
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,480
they are compiled by the pi installers

624
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,760
so

625
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,720
there is a runtime environment for the

626
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,919
script

627
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,600
so you cannot try to

628
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:36,320
create yara rule for specific

629
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,360
characters that you could find after the

630
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,799
compilation

631
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,039
of this to this python script however

632
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,080
there are quite unique imports in the

633
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,120
script

634
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,520
and for example i used

635
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,799
i used them to to hunt for those

636
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,200
keyloggers

637
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,918
it's very hard to to find the keylogger

638
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,120
for a very

639
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,880
for specific group but with this yara

640
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,879
for example you could find

641
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,440
a group of keyloggers that are with

642
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,640
high confidence associated with the

643
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,200
african threat groups

644
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,520
and later on after the compilation

645
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,159
analysts could

646
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,559
could gather more information and apply

647
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,760
a second era rules to the decompile

648
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,279
script

649
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,279
and then cluster the the malware

650
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,279
so you could see that the core the

651
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,879
origin of the keyloggers

652
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,799
is is unchanged

653
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,880
and usually there are small differences

654
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,080
and also small differences how they

655
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,679
use those keyloggers how they choose the

656
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,320
directories so this is quite

657
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,679
quite common now we will focus on grabs

658
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:53,600
on infrastructure

659
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,600
and their capabilities from 2020

660
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,520
actually we try to analyze one of the

661
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,840
ips and this ip was found

662
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,080
in one of the public resources from

663
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,760
honest services

664
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,840
i if you if this topic also finds you

665
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,039
interesting

666
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,799
i really recommend visiting their

667
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,360
webpage and reading their materials

668
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:22,480
which is

669
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,479
often fascinating story

670
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,880
so i found this ip and i tried to

671
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,399
analyze if there is

672
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,640
any information that i could gather more

673
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,760
and

674
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,159
reach about this ip what are those new

675
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,840
python free better capabilities of those

676
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,760
group that was my analytic

677
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,760
question so if we go to showdown and

678
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,960
especially that the beta version which

679
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,000
offers the history

680
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:51,600
in its gui and uh

681
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,399
really recommends trying beta version of

682
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,320
showdown not

683
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:59,360
not the old one because history

684
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,360
of the previously indexed information

685
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,678
is very useful during such

686
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,639
investigations

687
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,480
is there anything interesting for sure

688
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,120
ports like

689
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:13,440
3306 389 could be very interesting

690
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,158
because those are parts connected with

691
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,840
uh

692
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:22,720
mysql database with rdp

693
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:25,760
so if we if we check those uh

694
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,880
unusual ports we could learn more about

695
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,760
infrastructure about previous actions of

696
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,880
this

697
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,520
threat group generally this ap

698
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,039
belongs to the hosting which as you can

699
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,399
see on the screen

700
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:43,440
very often offers some um

701
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:46,639
vps's vms uh

702
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,080
focus on offensive security capabilities

703
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,440
like kali linux

704
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,559
parallel security torque hidden service

705
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,320
also for example so it is also very

706
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,200
important to know that

707
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,439
such a group prefers this type of

708
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,200
hosting because whenever in later

709
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,240
in investigations will gather new

710
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,799
data this could help us to

711
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,360
support our hypothesis for example if

712
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,639
this

713
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,360
if the next ip belongs to that group and

714
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,519
if it is also the same hosting that this

715
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,439
could be an indicator for

716
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,200
that could help us to support our

717
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:28,240
hypothesis

718
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:31,760
so if we check the rdp on this on that

719
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,640
on that host that was served several

720
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,519
weeks ago we could find out that there

721
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,919
is a

722
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,080
message related to the national bank of

723
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,200
kenya

724
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,678
so probably what the adverse adversary

725
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,760
did

726
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:51,120
was that they tunneled out the

727
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,960
access to the computer inside the

728
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:58,080
national bank of kenya and they accessed

729
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,000
that workstation after tunneling out

730
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,760
this traffic

731
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,240
so this is one of the indicators that

732
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:08,879
they successfully

733
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,880
breached this financial institution

734
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,880
and if we would like to analyze what was

735
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,960
on port 8080

736
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,200
which was associated with this new

737
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,720
python free backdoor capabilities we

738
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,799
could find out that

739
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,760
there is not much information something

740
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,879
about

741
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:30,559
uh something from august something from

742
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,880
july and probably not related to this

743
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,600
backdoor

744
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,640
because as far as i learned this vector

745
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,000
was used

746
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,000
in the beginning of the year

747
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,159
so what kind of backdoor they are

748
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,039
probably using

749
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,760
if you take the strings that are also

750
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,960
available

751
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:54,559
on this website

752
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,840
you could easily find the the project

753
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,360
on google there are only seven uh seven

754
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,240
hits in google

755
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,959
and there is an iteration project on

756
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,000
github

757
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,760
this is not not human resources

758
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,679
project but the backdoor with a server

759
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,279
component written in python

760
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,279
in python 3 actually

761
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,320
[Music]

762
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,640
and and it could be used on many of the

763
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,639
platforms like linux

764
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,120
macos windows uh it has the capabilities

765
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,640
also

766
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,399
to validate the client and you could

767
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,840
also filter out

768
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:39,600
the the client so maybe there is

769
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,120
not much information on this c2 that we

770
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:47,199
analyzed because

771
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,199
the there was a kind of a firewalling

772
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,000
but if you take the same string which is

773
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,159
quite unique and there were only

774
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,519
seven hits in google and you check it on

775
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,760
virustotal

776
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,840
there there's also not much only two

777
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,720
files with those strings

778
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,439
but you could see also the detections

779
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,640
and

780
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,760
have a look they're only after the

781
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,200
compilation compilation of this python

782
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,800
scripts to

783
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,839
exe file there's only one av detection

784
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,879
using the

785
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,239
static signature so probably that's the

786
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,598
reason why the

787
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:26,479
grabs on group tries to utilize new

788
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,639
capabilities and tries to find something

789
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,599
that evades

790
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,599
av detection

791
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,839
so what about um

792
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,879
c2 server component can we learn

793
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,759
something about that

794
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,719
are there any traces on this ip related

795
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,960
to this

796
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:49,839
project so this is a python based

797
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,839
http server

798
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,679
and i i found only one indicator in

799
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,799
january

800
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,119
that this could be

801
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,359
the time when the project was deployed

802
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,000
and and was active and you could see the

803
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,680
header

804
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,280
connected with python3 and the and the

805
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,440
project workstoric

806
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,440
so on the above pictures you have

807
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:21,359
parts from the source code and

808
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,240
below you have the http response

809
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:26,880
from the one of the from the ip that we

810
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,720
analyzed and is attributed to to grab

811
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,359
zone in this year

812
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,560
so i tried to play a little bit with

813
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,920
this project and

814
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,960
try that tried out to to find a way

815
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,320
if there is any possibility to to

816
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,079
fingerprint

817
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:49,119
this cto server and maybe to

818
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,920
to find new instances maybe to track if

819
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,480
anybody in

820
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,240
on the internet is using that kind of

821
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,640
capabilities

822
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:02,240
so when i used curl for experiments

823
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:05,440
i received similar headers that i

824
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,040
saw on this ip that was belonging to

825
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,520
grab zone

826
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,960
of course the the version of python was

827
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,560
different because i had different

828
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:18,880
environment but other headers were

829
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,880
quite similar or almost the same

830
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,760
so just just to check generally how many

831
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,640
workshops

832
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,200
servers are deployed in the internet

833
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,200
there are like

834
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,400
160 000

835
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:37,759
servers if you

836
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,960
look for the specific version the

837
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,320
la the number is quite lower and quite

838
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,000
manageable

839
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,000
it's about 300.

840
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,240
however if we take those headers which

841
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,440
are quite unique to this

842
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,879
this project the the numbers are being

843
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,160
filtered out

844
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,359
and and later on

845
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,799
i i also try to analyze the source code

846
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,319
of the c2 component

847
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,040
and there is a one resource registered

848
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,359
the the commander so whenever you send

849
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,680
the

850
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:19,920
get to the commander url

851
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:23,279
you receive the 308 permanent redirect

852
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,960
not very popular http response

853
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,000
and this permanent redirect redirects to

854
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,200
the

855
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,240
commander with slash at the end and then

856
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,359
you receive http response 200.

857
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,078
so with so this kind of a behavior

858
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,200
that when you send the get commander

859
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,560
without slash

860
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,680
you you get 308 permanent redirect

861
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,000
and then you send the the right

862
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,200
gets to the commander with slash and you

863
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,320
receive

864
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,240
uh http response 200.

865
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,520
this kind of a behavior is something

866
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,319
very unique

867
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,720
to this python c2 server

868
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,000
and with this knowledge it is very

869
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,399
possible to

870
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,440
to search in census to search in

871
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,240
showdown

872
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,000
for those servers because in this case

873
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,520
i'm trying to find out

874
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,359
what servers are giving me the response

875
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,560
302 because this is the response

876
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,920
when i when i set the simple get to the

877
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,119
root

878
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,400
and i only focus on 302 and

879
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,440
if i want to be 100 percent sure

880
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:39,839
i can then send the get to the

881
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,839
commander url and

882
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:48,319
be absolutely sure that there is a

883
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,960
i hr shell server behind

884
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,160
that was the example of a search for

885
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,280
senses this is an

886
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,879
example in the syntax that is used by

887
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,520
shodhan so generally

888
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,839
i'm looking for the specific headers but

889
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,599
i'm not looking for the response

890
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:11,200
200. this response only happens when you

891
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:14,640
send the correct url and in this case

892
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:19,279
showdown sensors are sending just the

893
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,279
the most basic gets to the root

894
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,720
what are other c2 fingerprints on this

895
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,078
ip server can we learn more about the

896
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,439
adversary what

897
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,160
what kind of services they used this

898
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,280
year

899
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,960
when they were operating with this

900
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,839
server hosted there

901
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,480
so there is quite unique subject for the

902
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,640
ssl

903
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,400
certificate and when you take this

904
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:49,520
subject and try to

905
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,520
search the database for ssl certificates

906
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,480
for example in in census there are only

907
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,000
two

908
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,240
ips that are currently hosting ssl

909
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,359
certificates with such a subject

910
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,720
one is our well-known

911
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,839
ip that begins with 145

912
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,959
but there is also another one and

913
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,440
hosted in the same ip address range of

914
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,520
the

915
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:20,240
ovh hosting which rents place to the

916
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,640
to the second hosting company that's

917
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,479
that

918
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:28,480
offers vps's

919
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,800
this second ip uh i'm not sure if it is

920
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,520
uh related to grab zone but it's always

921
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,520
where for

922
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,599
thread intel analysts to mark such

923
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,640
information and maybe later on

924
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,000
when we when our investigations gather

925
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,640
more data we collect

926
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,680
more information maybe later on we could

927
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,279
connect

928
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,399
uh this new ap with grab some grub zone

929
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,000
cluster

930
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:55,839
uh and in thread intel world we also

931
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,240
use very often uh markings with

932
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,040
with our confidence level so we could

933
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,319
mark it with it

934
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,200
with very low confidence level this is

935
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,079
the ip

936
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,439
that possibly belongs to to grub zone

937
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,760
and maybe later on

938
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,040
when we get more data more confidence we

939
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,680
could change this

940
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,680
assessment

941
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,759
and there are also other interesting

942
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,880
city finger prints that i found

943
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,359
related to this ip actually on another

944
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,400
port

945
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,598
there were there was another http

946
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,880
response

947
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,839
with such body a get file not specified

948
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,839
in url

949
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:44,879
and when when i took this string

950
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:48,079
again into the google i found only one

951
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,760
one response there was a blog post about

952
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,400
the man who

953
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,400
showed how to create a file server spile

954
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,839
server in golang language

955
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,720
and to host files so

956
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,680
it looks that the adversary adversary

957
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,520
took the code

958
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:08,640
and hosted this golang server just to

959
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,119
serve the files um

960
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,319
they only did small modification they

961
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,079
added some

962
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:20,160
http response headers and my my opinion

963
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:23,599
is that they added those headers because

964
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,440
they use this server to download files

965
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,119
on the victim machines using their

966
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,319
browsers

967
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,880
so not using the c2 channel and

968
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,240
those headers are there to to make sure

969
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,680
that the browser

970
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,879
does not send any

971
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,640
any warnings that there is a

972
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:48,480
problem with extension and the mime type

973
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,680
and that's why those extension problems

974
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,800
file type problems

975
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:56,480
are neglected

976
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,760
so if you take this specific string

977
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,960
you can only find currently one one ip

978
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,000
address

979
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,480
well known to us but whenever they

980
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,520
decide to use it again this type of

981
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,400
service

982
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,280
somewhere else probably it would be

983
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,599
quite easy to

984
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,720
to find them if they decide to to

985
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,599
continue this

986
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,598
capabilities on different infrastructure

987
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,119
using showdown there is very convenient

988
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,240
ways to use the the hashes of the

989
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,160
responses

990
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,359
showdown hushes the response and you

991
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,640
could use the hash

992
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:34,960
and the result is also the same so the

993
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,598
this service is served on two parts on

994
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,599
this ip

995
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,599
some other hints about hunting their

996
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,079
their tools

997
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,440
for example the the client part of the

998
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,160
hr shell

999
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,760
after the compilation with the pi

1000
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,799
installer to to windows

1001
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,599
executable there is a manifest

1002
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,800
file in the resources and when you try

1003
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,760
to look

1004
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,160
uh try to find for other samples that

1005
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,520
have

1006
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:07,520
the same manifest file in the resources

1007
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:11,280
you only find the hr shell

1008
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,680
samples for example the it is that

1009
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,800
manifest file very unique to this

1010
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,799
project

1011
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:22,000
and when you search for this resources

1012
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,119
for example in the virus total database

1013
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,119
in the latest indices you get only

1014
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:32,880
15 files and all those files are

1015
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:37,599
compiled hr shell

1016
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,520
component client component

1017
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,440
is there anything else suspicious on

1018
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,400
this cost yeah there are some

1019
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,760
more interesting things that were hosted

1020
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,760
on this ip

1021
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:53,119
for example in february in march

1022
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:56,880
april there was such a response probably

1023
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,640
some of you that are uh familiar with

1024
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,280
offensive security

1025
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,078
frameworks they know what kind of uh

1026
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,440
tool that could

1027
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:10,640
be so this is a default

1028
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,640
uh metal predator response

1029
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,640
in january on this on the same ip there

1030
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,079
was a ps empire hosted

1031
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:23,520
this is a very also very typical default

1032
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:26,720
response from the ps empire c2

1033
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,440
however i do not associate this activity

1034
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,879
with this

1035
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:34,640
groudon cluster why is that because

1036
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,880
that the fingerprint of the ssh

1037
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,480
so we had today the presentation about

1038
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,280
fingerprinting

1039
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,400
very interesting and fingerprinting is

1040
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,000
very useful

1041
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:49,599
uh in our daily job so in this case

1042
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:53,760
we we know that the fingerprint of the

1043
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:56,800
ssh service was changed on the 24th

1044
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,640
of january so and

1045
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:03,680
it was present till now

1046
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,680
and everything before 24

1047
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,799
could be a different build of the

1048
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,919
operating system

1049
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,760
it could be same actor that reinstalled

1050
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,839
the the software but

1051
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,079
we can't have uh even moderate

1052
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:20,319
confidence for that so

1053
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,520
up to now i do not include those

1054
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,359
information that

1055
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,000
this is belong then this could be

1056
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:28,319
related to the african threads

1057
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,720
it could be totally somebody else even

1058
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,839
the red team

1059
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,520
in december there was also uh something

1060
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,078
interesting this is a typical

1061
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,119
response from the global strike is it

1062
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,960
same actor

1063
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,720
we don't have hard evidence for

1064
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,720
clustering that

1065
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,000
could be somebody else that that uses

1066
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,040
that

1067
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,960
one cloud hosting

1068
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,960
so generally what we learned about grub

1069
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,480
zone

1070
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,040
summary so the capabilities they use

1071
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,319
they use

1072
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,279
hr shell from other samples from other

1073
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:05,279
knowledge

1074
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:08,319
we know that they use rg rg rod

1075
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,640
free they use steel metal predator they

1076
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,560
use

1077
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:15,118
rdp tunneling with probably ng rock

1078
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,200
so when they uh bridge the organize the

1079
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,000
victim organization they try to tunnel

1080
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,558
out

1081
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:25,520
uh some protocols to have easier access

1082
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:28,160
to their infrastructure they use tools

1083
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,520
downloaded via victim browsers

1084
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,118
because they use the file server written

1085
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,640
in go

1086
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:39,599
they we see that they prefer such

1087
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,558
infrastructure created in the hosting

1088
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,599
company named

1089
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,599
cloud one host

1090
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,240
they do not use domain based

1091
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,760
infrastructure they use only ip based

1092
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,319
infrastructure

1093
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,559
and about something about the victims so

1094
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:57,040
through the analysis of their

1095
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,960
infrastructure we we learned that they

1096
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,759
were probably successful against

1097
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:05,440
bridging national bank of kenya

1098
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,680
which was also um

1099
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,520
supported by by later evidence and

1100
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,000
different other sources that

1101
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,880
yes that the krabs on was successful in

1102
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,880
in preaching them

1103
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,160
if you also feel interested in in those

1104
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,680
subjects i really recommend going to

1105
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,200
honored services

1106
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:28,558
to this so to the blog of the company

1107
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:31,200
that uh really fights those threads

1108
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,880
and they don't only support them with

1109
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,558
instant response

1110
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,960
um you could see that africa threat

1111
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,040
landscape is quite unique and you could

1112
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,319
meet many of the techniques that are not

1113
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,480
very popular somewhere

1114
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,359
somewhere else like this hardware

1115
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,079
editions

1116
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:49,680
and on the other hand and defenders are

1117
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,760
also

1118
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,200
working uh the other way around because

1119
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,960
people from honest services

1120
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,160
are often have often the authorization

1121
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,839
from government to hug

1122
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,240
back and they also hug back the city

1123
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:04,640
infrastructure

1124
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,680
of the adversaries and lots of the

1125
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,960
samples

1126
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:12,160
are gathered from the from such uh

1127
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,160
offensive network operations

1128
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,160
and i have to admit that they are very

1129
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,920
brave people because they are

1130
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:23,118
uh fighting them locally and the threats

1131
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,520
are and the risk is is quite real it's

1132
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,720
not

1133
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,880
like a simple analysis of uh of threats

1134
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,439
when you're sitting miles away

1135
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,559
they conduct very close proximity

1136
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,760
operations

1137
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:39,200
against those threats and those

1138
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:42,839
those gangs have big support from the

1139
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:46,799
politicians from corrupted policemen

1140
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:49,200
so uh yeah and so

1141
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,839
very interesting and and great chapel

1142
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,240
batu

1143
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:57,279
to those people uh who fight aft groups

1144
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:00,399
and thank you all for for watching

1145
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,119
uh for listening hope you are also

1146
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,839
interested

1147
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,960
in this new thread landscape new for me

1148
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:13,839
maybe also for

1149
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:13,839
for you too thank you

1150
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,640
you
