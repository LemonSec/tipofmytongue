1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,240
uh the topic of my keynote and the

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,879
keynote for the conference presentation

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,359
would be

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,080
how north korean hackers are working

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,480
with eastern european cyber criminals

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,560
my name is vitalia kremes my also

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,039
twitter handles vk intel

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,479
and i'm going to dive deeper into the

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,279
intersection between some of the

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,439
offensive

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,120
capabilities we developed to look into

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,960
some of the nation state groups

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,718
and what their arsenal how they target

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,719
us and also look at the cyber crime

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,000
groups that are financially motivated

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,640
what are some of the interesting

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,719
intersections across them too

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,239
so let's start from there actually this

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,039
is one of the reports we published

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,279
earlier

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,520
it was actually the report was probably

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,719
one of the biggest discoveries of 20

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,199
2019 2020 it's that time when we

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,160
finally found the technical evidence

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,480
behind

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,160
the north korean hackers working closely

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,479
with one specific

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,080
uh sophisticated russian or eastern

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,200
european cyber crime group

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,880
and we'll dive deeper into the

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
intersection what it means and we'll

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,479
show actually specific toolkits that

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,799
uh they will use to to look for that

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,679
so the agenda of the talk would be

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,080
covering

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,600
uh what the unique things and what

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,439
unique aspects of the

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,798
underground and cyber crime world we've

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,639
seen as the past

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,400
years or two what's the evolution what's

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,600
next future we would see

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,759
across both the uh groups that target us

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,679
and how we can defend across that uh

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,200
spectrum we'll talk about this specific

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,200
group group called trigbot

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,880
and their project called anchor we'll

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,680
talk about what's what they're trying to

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,839
achieve

49
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,360
and what the massive machinery behind

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,479
their operation how it works and how

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,720
they specifically

52
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,520
introduced one unique product called

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,240
anchor

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,280
anchor was the fork of the malware

55
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,880
itself

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,560
of the trigabat core itself so it

57
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,479
contains unique functionality but it

58
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,799
matured and actually

59
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,960
evolved more into high value target tool

60
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,640
specific tool used only to target

61
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,479
the most interesting and sophisticated

62
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,759
targets such as big financial

63
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,560
institutions

64
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,120
government networks etc uh also we'll

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,040
talk about

66
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,879
what the unique aspects about the world

67
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,879
itself uh we'll talk about the

68
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,480
kind of uniting the unitable so the

69
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,399
crimeware meets apt

70
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,040
advanced persistent threat groups no

71
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,360
longer we can treat the world as it's uh

72
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,079
the groups are uh financially motivated

73
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,920
groups are

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,080
not connected at all to nation state

75
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,839
groups as we've seen with different

76
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,280
operations in the world and of course

77
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,120
through like different

78
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,560
espionage groups but we've seen the

79
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,879
unique intersections and the

80
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,080
the unique intersection was across the

81
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,280
uh group we call

82
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,599
uh lazarus which is a north korean uh

83
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,959
linked uh nation state sponsor group

84
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,359
which has to collect

85
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,160
currency in bringing back to the north

86
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,080
korean

87
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,519
budget they'll talk about the trigbot

88
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,239
group and the crime work groups that are

89
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,599
linked to that

90
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,519
and those groups are of course

91
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,440
financially motivated at first

92
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,879
but they are also uh working together

93
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,720
now which is just kind of like the

94
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,399
unique discovery across the spectrum

95
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,319
we'll talk about what does it mean the

96
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,920
the deadly planeswalker

97
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,599
and what the unique aspects of the

98
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,559
cyberpunk world will introduce to some

99
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,959
of the unique

100
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,800
aspects what are the unique ways how we

101
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,360
can use in the future and of course for

102
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,480
current

103
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,599
to run very efficient and long-standing

104
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,679
yara rules

105
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,879
so we'll talk we'll dive deeper into

106
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,200
that

107
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,518
so my name is vitalik kramez i'm also a

108
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,119
well-known ethical hacker

109
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,280
some of my research has been been

110
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,360
published before many times

111
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,000
in the press oftentimes have my own blog

112
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,360
vramis.com you can take a look feel free

113
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,440
uh one of the unique one of the unique

114
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,120
aspects of the

115
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,959
one of the aspects of i guess myself

116
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,000
itself i worked previously in the us

117
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,599
government

118
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,680
tracking some of the most sophisticated

119
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,200
groups oftentimes my name is actually

120
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,280
appears in some malware

121
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,679
one of the unique aspects i guess the

122
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,959
one the russian state group called apt

123
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,519
28 included my name

124
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,120
in the properties of the one of the

125
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,560
binary files

126
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
signing with that so so my name is

127
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,439
pretty popular in the malware community

128
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,040
but also i i'm also an executive and a

129
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,480
strategic advisor itself so

130
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,079
feel free to follow me on twitter too

131
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,760
like you try to share

132
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,439
some of the technical evidence some

133
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,639
technical links across the malware

134
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,478
samples to try to help

135
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,440
uh mitigate and protect against cyber

136
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,520
threats this is me

137
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,320
so what are the cyber crime trends of

138
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,198
2020 and what do we see in the world of

139
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,320
attacks and who target us from both one

140
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,160
of the unique aspects about the

141
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,960
conference itself which attracts me

142
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,000
so much in touch with my uh heart is

143
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,840
that's the connections

144
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,759
between the defense defensive and

145
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,520
offensive aspects of our mind

146
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,600
i think i definitely believe that to be

147
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,680
a great uh defender you need to be a

148
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,400
great hacker there's no way around this

149
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,600
and to be a great malware develop great

150
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,758
malware protections you need to

151
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,040
develop really great malware

152
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,600
capabilities itself

153
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,320
so there's a very interconnected mind so

154
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,280
and i think

155
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,639
in my view in the world as we see from

156
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,080
from from from the

157
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,320
colleagues and and essentially the

158
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,320
company that iran it's that we would

159
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,320
believe that by studying cyber criminals

160
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,639
and what they do it allows us to

161
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,840
have predictive value so we can know in

162
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,960
how to both defend

163
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,320
and we can also know what the tools uh

164
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,560
what the tools they can be used in

165
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,039
future against us so we'll talk about

166
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,680
the

167
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,280
the cyber crime terms of 2020. it's that

168
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,560
the sophisticated criminal enterprises

169
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,080
trigbot quagbot and of course ta505

170
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,080
are currently focused on the partisan

171
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,320
high value targets what they do

172
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,320
is the botnets as you might be familiar

173
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,039
with those those are very notorious big

174
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,320
botnets

175
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,599
are currently used to uh prediction like

176
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,240
loading purposes

177
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
to and of course uh targeting as well so

178
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,199
they're

179
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,000
very active they're blind predominantly

180
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,320
by spam email stem intrusions or attacks

181
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,560
or

182
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,000
spam campaigns uh they also have a

183
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,000
plethora of affiliates they

184
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,280
work with but what they do is they're no

185
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,600
longer interested in

186
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,679
regular regular targets uh there's

187
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,080
actually this less value to extract but

188
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,639
they highly focus and develop tooling

189
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,719
around the parsing and identifying high

190
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,000
value targets hvt

191
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,319
and that's where the kind of also the

192
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,919
crime cyber crime meets apt as we've

193
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,759
seen with the ransomware approach

194
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,120
that's where the flavor of the day the

195
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,520
ransomware is the most

196
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,400
profitable venture currently even across

197
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,240
the cybercrime

198
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,599
world where some of the most basic

199
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
groups realize that

200
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,680
they already have uh essentially access

201
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,240
to the entry of the house so they can

202
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,440
use

203
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,039
the groups of exploitation uh affiliates

204
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,639
to deploy ransomware and this kind of

205
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,000
becomes very targeted and very apt

206
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,160
apt-like advanced

207
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,600
persistent threat group i've also seen

208
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,600
that the ransom hacks

209
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,039
used to amplify extortion where they use

210
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,759
social media as well

211
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,520
but also the the big botanic data

212
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,319
collectors they need scalable solutions

213
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,359
to identify high value targets including

214
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,800
corporate networks

215
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,400
such as corporate networks with local

216
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,280
domains and of course

217
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,880
to filter out disinfections that are not

218
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,919
corporate or governments who do not have

219
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,319
like for example

220
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,039
active directory trees and the idea is

221
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,120
pretty simple

222
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,960
has always been and it still is it's

223
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,400
just to squeeze more pounds euros and

224
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,479
dollars value from

225
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,758
from from your bots as much as possible

226
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,039
so the key

227
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,199
what they were being deployed is the

228
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,919
banking malware it's the key of course

229
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,080
credential steel malware still use minor

230
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,479
used but in lesser capacity now

231
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,440
due to the uh unstable i guess uh the

232
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,840
market around bitcoins and xmr etc

233
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,560
ransomware is the flavor of the day and

234
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
actually i

235
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,000
already spoke actually in pretty good

236
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,960
positions on the next cyber crime

237
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,599
frontier actually

238
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,318
diving deeper into those attack vectors

239
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,080
but the

240
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,599
but understanding around the cyber crime

241
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,080
trends is that

242
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,360
those groups are essentially focused on

243
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,758
identifying

244
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,400
the most lucrative targets within their

245
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,639
networks

246
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,599
and those are the ones that are used to

247
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,919
essentially target

248
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,039
and use kind of a more human

249
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,639
exploitation approach

250
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,560
but also they sell some of those

251
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,000
infections or auction or they work

252
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,440
closely with the groups

253
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,280
and this is kind of like the kind of the

254
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,360
cyber crime model

255
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,119
developed predominantly or rather

256
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,319
evolved in the european

257
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,599
or eastern european world

258
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,160
and of course we cannot talk um before

259
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,319
about anything related to major groups

260
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,639
operations botnets specifically

261
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,000
in crime world without mentioning slavic

262
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,879
because he's the godfather

263
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,160
you know in some shape or form of the

264
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,840
cyber crime itself

265
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,599
he developed the scalable models and

266
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,679
solutions including the peer-to-peer

267
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,759
zeus and build the business club

268
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,720
he became a business person in the world

269
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,519
of the

270
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,240
uh crime and he's the one who developed

271
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,440
uh

272
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,799
the the business club which was used to

273
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,519
both uh cash out and do fraud directly

274
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,159
through the

275
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,160
pier zeus but also through also he

276
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,800
deployed the first ransomware or rather

277
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,279
the

278
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,640
commercialized ransomware cryptolocker

279
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,279
and one of the interesting aspects that

280
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,040
they also

281
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,959
kind of tries to pursue more corporate

282
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,439
targets and he's the one that also

283
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,599
laid the foundations of the uh

284
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,640
cybercrime world and cybercrime actors

285
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,360
as it came

286
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,319
came came along with him or after him

287
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,720
because they

288
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,720
all in both of the cases we've seen the

289
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,000
drydex and trigbad groups that we're

290
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,560
just talking about here

291
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,680
there are former customers of the slavic

292
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,839
operations

293
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,439
and he is the one that uh at the

294
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,399
forefront of everything and in the

295
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,880
beginner of

296
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,560
uh the root of all evil if so to speak

297
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,640
and the idea is that once again just to

298
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,160
solidify is the county for high value

299
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,040
targets

300
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,680
and that's where the um the most of the

301
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,000
tooling

302
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,519
as i mentioned earlier arise from one of

303
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,560
the most active

304
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,640
ways and some of the active um

305
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,920
attack chains from the offensive to

306
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,519
defensive side

307
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,519
from from there from the crime offensive

308
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,440
side as i mentioned earlier to really

309
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,440
be ahead of the criminals you need to

310
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,440
think like that you need to

311
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,880
to be like them in many shape or forms

312
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,880
but without committing crimes

313
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,160
and learning studying behaviors and what

314
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,240
they do is

315
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,160
that it's kind of a typical attack chain

316
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,800
where you can now conti rant somewhere

317
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,480
or you've been supplanted or replaced by

318
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,839
contirent ransomware by the same chain

319
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,760
of group of actors

320
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,839
but usually imitate for example it's a

321
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,480
malware uses a loader then they deploy

322
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,320
trigbot banking malware to steal banking

323
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,120
credentials or

324
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,399
improve their visibility machines and

325
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
then of course ransomware

326
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,160
and the way they identify which machines

327
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,680
will be deployed just thinking taking

328
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,439
them take into account that

329
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,160
they have thousands of infections all

330
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,959
over the world what one unique idea

331
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,079
can bring them closer to the most high

332
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,160
value targets the most

333
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,640
money they can make the most money they

334
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,319
can the most time they can save

335
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,079
on their own so they would not waste

336
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,720
their time dealing with

337
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,560
small accounts and focused on big value

338
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,800
valuable targets is that

339
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,599
the machines that respond back they can

340
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,240
ask machines

341
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,640
hey return back the net view of all the

342
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,800
uh

343
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,279
networks and by the nephew records

344
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,719
parsed and active directory responses

345
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,320
they can identify oh those are machines

346
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,000
are more interesting for us to pursue

347
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,760
from the human exploitation side

348
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
and they will deploy essentially as i

349
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,959
mentioned here that powershell empire

350
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,800
is the one of the flavor of the days in

351
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,920
cobalt strike those are the common

352
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,479
of course open um rather offensive

353
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,040
uh tools use their penetration testing

354
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,839
tools

355
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,120
used by the cranberry groups so from the

356
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,959
defensive side

357
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,800
thinking about what they operate it's

358
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,319
also kind of they can look

359
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,560
like penetration testers in your

360
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,040
networks but in fact they are just

361
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,199
simply

362
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,199
cyber criminal groups are using the

363
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,839
cyber crime precursors

364
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,560
the normal like genes of imotat and

365
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,880
trigbot

366
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,640
and then also jumping into the

367
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,800
penetration test testing kits

368
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,959
and the way they bridge those gaps is

369
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,560
the network and active directory parts

370
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,599
pretty interesting idea and this

371
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,040
actually works for them phenomenally

372
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,040
another aspect and this is kind of to

373
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,040
show you what are unique aspects and how

374
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,959
it works of course from their side

375
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,599
uh actually this is the intercepted

376
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,279
operations of the actual groups behind

377
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
as we mentioned earlier this is them of

378
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,680
course looking into interpreter

379
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,199
and the armitage view and the beacon of

380
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
course

381
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,440
as you can see in the bottom and there's

382
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,360
a look that's them parsing the networks

383
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,720
looking for unique high valuable targets

384
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,440
etc

385
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,639
but this is the unique aspect of the

386
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,160
operation so they

387
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:21,160
essentially hired a staffed folks who

388
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,959
or other operators who are skilled in

389
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,480
exploitations

390
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,479
pretty interesting idea and it's

391
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,519
actually this is the uh

392
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,480
future and current state of the malware

393
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,360
landscape and again one of the

394
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,200
interesting aspects

395
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,839
of the talk is that uh how profitable

396
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,600
uh it can be and in one case the cloud

397
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,560
jumper which is a very common

398
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,200
uh msp provider in the united states uh

399
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,760
that's

400
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,320
where i'm from um so they essentially

401
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,319
extorted

402
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,720
their customer base in five billion

403
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,120
dollars in total five percent of their

404
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,360
whole

405
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,440
customer base and to be paid in bitcoins

406
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,680
so it's uh in cryptocurrency

407
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,760
super profitable super successful i call

408
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,959
it like the ransomware in the cloud

409
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,240
and this is kind of like that's what

410
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,439
they've been doing they've been looking

411
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,600
for

412
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,079
and companies with that with huge

413
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,959
networks companies that also are msp

414
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,560
providers

415
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,160
and also companies that have

416
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,560
interconnected access to

417
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,439
large environments and this is the

418
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,160
flavor of the day

419
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,880
and also we'll dive deeper into what the

420
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,760
unique

421
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,079
uh aspects and how they work with the

422
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,800
lazarus or the north korean groups as we

423
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,359
established

424
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,399
earlier is that there is a the crime

425
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,600
trends are

426
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,079
focused on parsing high value targets by

427
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,639
network records they're also interested

428
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,920
in in

429
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,880
big corporate networks to reach with

430
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,800
uh point of sale terminals uh reach with

431
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,720
a swift for example gateways

432
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,439
rich with different other atm

433
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,800
automated uh tailor machine network

434
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,800
setups and environments

435
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,000
so they're the most uh profitable for

436
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,560
them but the

437
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,240
the way they monetize the breaches or

438
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,160
the accesses the groups

439
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,519
the intersections from the hacker

440
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,600
mindset is that

441
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,560
this is accessed as a commodity so they

442
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,480
oftentimes hey

443
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,399
we get access like for example they get

444
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,320
access to major us

445
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,839
institution financial institutions and

446
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,040
they will say to another actor hey we

447
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,240
get access to one

448
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,319
major financial institutions they can

449
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,040
try to sell access to the dark web of

450
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,680
course the

451
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,360
forums like exploit and many others or

452
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,638
they can also try to

453
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,959
uh sell once or access as a service

454
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,720
or work in a profit share and model or

455
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,638
they can offer an actor

456
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,760
you know we give you free access to any

457
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,839
bots of your choice

458
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,880
but you'll just pay us a percentage of

459
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,519
the engagement

460
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,000
which is probably which is probably one

461
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,320
of the more

462
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,240
interesting aspects of of work from for

463
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,440
many sophisticated groups because they

464
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,680
prefer stable

465
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,440
access and they'll just pay a percentage

466
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,599
fee especially in the beginning it's a

467
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,800
lucrative model and we believe that acts

468
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,839
as a service is the model

469
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,199
used by trigbot and lassos group based

470
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:02,079
on the evidence we obtained

471
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,000
so the and the angle so there was the

472
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,519
there was apt approach and there was a

473
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,560
ransomware of course angles that we

474
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,839
discussed earlier

475
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,959
is that the tree but itself has been

476
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,399
a pretty phenomenal malware on its own

477
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,560
it has been brought back to life in 2016

478
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,440
but it had the boots in the dire banking

479
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,000
malware

480
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,199
dire group with operations dyer was

481
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,040
basically

482
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,959
former customers of the person i

483
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,079
mentioned earlier slavic eugenie mikhail

484
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,359
vege bogachov

485
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:34,079
who is currently uh currently

486
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,440
on the fbi cyber most wanted list and

487
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,599
this is a three million dollar award so

488
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,079
if you ever find him somewhere

489
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,680
um we know that he likes his boat and

490
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,239
you know that he likes uh

491
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,920
boeing the black sea so he can you can

492
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,279
gain uh three million dollars from the

493
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,680
fbi in the us

494
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,480
department of justice but he's still out

495
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,040
and he

496
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,000
he was the one that uh offered actually

497
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,040
he was the

498
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,759
mastermind of the group of the that the

499
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,839
tire

500
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,160
was born into so the dyer was the

501
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,120
another bank in our group that became

502
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,920
of course disappeared after the supposed

503
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,040
russian

504
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,519
law enforcement takedown in 2015 2016

505
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,439
and then came back as treeback and the

506
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,639
facets of trigbat and the way it works

507
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,880
as you see there is a from

508
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,160
it does the banking fraud aspect

509
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,399
operations or the

510
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,319
direct account takeovers especially

511
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,360
focused on those accounts

512
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,320
in those banks they do have uh one day

513
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,240
transfers

514
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,920
those are the most valuable ones in the

515
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,680
us of course we have a cell

516
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,079
system that allows the quick bank

517
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,319
transfers they also have money drops of

518
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,959
course mule networks and wire transfers

519
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,600
so

520
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,920
they still monetize all the major banks

521
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,000
uh oftentimes uh

522
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,920
pretty successfully so that goes because

523
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,079
you know it has all has a steady income

524
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,079
going into their networks

525
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,279
also ransomware of course ryuk and now

526
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,599
conti ransomware has been used by them

527
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,040
as a group on its own there's of course

528
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,959
steelers where they steal different

529
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,560
aspects financial information personal

530
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,638
identifiable information network

531
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,119
information they still

532
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,720
applications passwords from different

533
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,520
open vpns to

534
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,720
rdps to uh many many other components

535
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,799
keep the money

536
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,480
so you can see it's a very rich

537
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,839
operations focused and financially

538
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,559
motivated aspect and this is the

539
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,958
crimeware

540
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,799
and the reason why we used to delineate

541
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,439
in the world of the intelligence we used

542
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,359
to say

543
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,559
there's a crime where what we mean by

544
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,198
crime where it's the financially

545
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,280
motivated

546
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,559
and this is the ept or rather nation

547
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,480
state apt

548
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,000
where it's those groups are not

549
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,160
interested in making money

550
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,919
from those machines that they're in fact

551
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,840
but in fact they're looking for

552
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,039
either for different purposes like for

553
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,000
example gain

554
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,919
uh espionage activities which is

555
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,880
commonly attributed to the chinese

556
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,080
apt groups or for example forced with

557
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,000
the u.s

558
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,960
elections and there's uh russian groups

559
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,600
including apt 2018-29 the russian

560
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,039
groups are linked to the gru the special

561
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,439
forces that are linked to

562
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,039
the election meddling and hacking into

563
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
the democratic national committee

564
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,200
so those have different targets in

565
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,919
different goals but but this was the

566
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,799
interesting aspect so the anchor mystery

567
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,160
the anchor

568
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,639
was this four project we found that had

569
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,640
uh the anchor pdb path which is a

570
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,480
program database path in the malware

571
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,080
while we're looking for trigba we're

572
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,799
looking for the trigbot crypter

573
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,240
basically

574
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,400
and through the crypter and through the

575
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,080
analysis into external hunting

576
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,919
we're able to identify there's another

577
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,840
fork of this called anchor it looked

578
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,720
like trick body had its own dns

579
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,320
component

580
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,480
different ways to communicate with the

581
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,678
server but it had unique features enough

582
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,240
unique features and the

583
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,919
replications of the communications they

584
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,000
would look like a trick but

585
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,600
so and we still was anchor deployed and

586
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,240
very interesting infections was not

587
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,399
spread

588
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,360
by normal triggered by channels and it

589
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,679
was actually

590
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,959
the connector between the worlds of the

591
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,360
crimeware and apt

592
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,600
and that's how we got into the north

593
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,479
korean attribution

594
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,120
as you can see here that the world of

595
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,880
apt

596
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,199
uh the crimeware it's of course

597
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,600
ransomware fraud steelers

598
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,400
and uh network hunting module is the

599
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,480
connector

600
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,240
to many operations inject modules

601
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,880
password graph for example

602
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,760
and then this the right side is the apt

603
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,919
domain

604
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,480
advanced persistent thread group domain

605
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,280
this is the domain where we can see the

606
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,160
point of sale malware also it's derived

607
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,039
from the

608
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,080
inc project anchored installer ejection

609
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,080
malware has a

610
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,199
de-installation capabilities to covertly

611
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,320
remove the traces

612
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,720
on the host which is super super um

613
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,240
super good for many romania of course

614
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,880
operate operators who want to be

615
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,960
stealthy

616
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,480
on this attack anchor bot and also the

617
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,240
link to power tango

618
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,919
so power tangba is the powershell of

619
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,559
course version as you might be familiar

620
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,640
with

621
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,320
uh of the return but it's that's the

622
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,760
malware that previously was fined

623
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,760
actually in poland

624
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,840
when the when the north korean group

625
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,879
attacked the polish bank authority

626
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,480
uh targeting them by a

627
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,320
waterfall in attack and also spreading

628
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,159
to different banks and the amount where

629
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,678
they deployed was

630
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,000
the power tank but it's a powerful

631
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,000
version of power shell rebuild

632
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,360
of the retarget tool as you can see the

633
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,159
and the approach was a little bit

634
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,158
different

635
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,440
they're staying in the networks longer

636
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,480
uh they're not

637
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,240
rushing into uh squeezing value as i

638
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,159
said earlier or looking for bank

639
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,640
transfers so the reconnaissance is the

640
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,960
key

641
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,240
point of sale terminals and environments

642
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,320
are super interesting to them

643
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,080
and that's where the lazarus north

644
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,720
korean group is

645
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,000
so and the anchor was that project

646
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,760
mystery that we found

647
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,760
and that was the discovery report we

648
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,559
actually published later on through the

649
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,559
sentinel labs

650
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,480
what's the unique technical uh link that

651
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,000
uh

652
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,600
that actually establishes the unique

653
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,600
high fidelity connections

654
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,240
it actually has never been never been

655
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,799
proven a hundred percent but we found

656
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,559
direct exact evidence of of the

657
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,879
connection between those groups

658
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,760
and the connections was similar pretty

659
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,600
simple

660
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,080
uh the treatment anchor server the

661
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,719
specific server has a task command

662
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,678
as you can see the ecom backstore was

663
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,760
the url

664
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,200
with the used with the with the action

665
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,840
and uh action with c

666
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
get pass was passed to the high profile

667
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,600
victim infections

668
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,880
to download and execute lazarus group

669
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,320
power takuba

670
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,799
and power tango is actually quite a

671
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,039
unique tool attributed exclusively to

672
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,720
the

673
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,400
lazarus group widely in information

674
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,159
security circles

675
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,000
and that was the mystery that unites

676
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,559
both the groups and explains

677
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,520
that something interesting so it's not

678
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,720
really

679
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,679
no longer we see just the kind of the

680
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,000
the regular looking crimeware tools we

681
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,559
see

682
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,679
some possible tools linked to the north

683
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,879
korean group and we're starting to

684
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,520
investigate it more

685
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,240
just remember this e-com bax store as a

686
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,240
domain

687
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,600
for the execution and that was the

688
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,080
technical exact

689
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,600
link between those groups that are

690
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,120
establishing the high fidelity

691
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,360
confidence and any assessments we have

692
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,199
the also where you might have seen this

693
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,959
exact you come back store

694
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,280
one of the cases and kind of like one of

695
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,440
the um

696
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,440
high profile events discovered and

697
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,080
discussed here the conference one would

698
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,679
could be the chilean red bank intrusions

699
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,720
as you remember maybe in 20

700
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,080
2018 2019 there was an intrusion in

701
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,080
chilean red bank

702
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,199
it's one of the biggest banks in chile

703
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,918
essentially

704
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,000
part of the intrusion was that one of

705
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,039
the developers inside the chilean bank

706
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,480
was approached on linkedin by

707
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:34,320
by a possible job job offer

708
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,000
and the job offer was another competing

709
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,240
bank and they essentially

710
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,760
offered them a skype interview in

711
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
spanish and actually because it's in

712
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,799
chile

713
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,000
so they offered a spanish language uh

714
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,360
hijab interview

715
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,440
and actually the person went to this

716
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,719
interview spoke spoken skype with a

717
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,240
spanish person and they

718
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,440
asked him to deploy or rather execute uh

719
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,960
an executable on the machine basically

720
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,440
an application just fill your name

721
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,640
fill your resumes but this application

722
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,840
itself contained

723
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,240
this i guess unique uh thread procedure

724
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,520
uh thread brock as they said uh and

725
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,440
whenever you launch this application

726
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,600
it's a simple.net

727
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,080
application developed by this losses

728
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,320
group that had this econ backstore

729
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,480
command at that time it was simply

730
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,280
base64 executed and downloaded through

731
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,360
powershell

732
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,440
and that's actually this specific

733
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,240
command was executed on the bank network

734
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,520
itself

735
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,840
through that uh skype linkedin

736
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,520
job interview violizers so two things

737
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,439
came up that lazarus a

738
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,559
have abilities or have people who can

739
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,400
speak spanish and b

740
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,559
is they have unique ways to distribute

741
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,360
malware directly to the bank employees

742
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,200
as needed

743
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,678
and but but again remember this econ

744
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,480
backstore this is the same exact you can

745
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,320
back store

746
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,760
task as we've seen the only difference

747
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,918
between the

748
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,879
anchor execution of the lazarus group

749
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,279
powershell

750
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,880
that we know and attribute to trigbad

751
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,240
and the and the

752
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,960
north korean of course uh apt skype

753
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,679
interview

754
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,640
tool execution was the last action from

755
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,520
the

756
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,679
agent psb was c and psb and actually all

757
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,120
the time timestamps match as well

758
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:14,720
so that's where the use exactly unique

759
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,479
link light lies in so throughout this

760
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,520
research that was came out to be very

761
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,440
interesting

762
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,440
and this was the tool was deployed

763
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,640
actually i was part of the julian ray

764
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,799
bank intrusion

765
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,919
incident uh response and i was looking

766
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,600
into some of those

767
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,840
some of the work that was done actually

768
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,399
and the bank was able to successfully

769
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,879
stop the tank the attack at the time

770
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,559
their

771
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,640
the north korean group deployed specific

772
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,399
tools known to be attributed to them

773
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,679
on their networks and try to harvest and

774
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,720
get access to the core

775
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,320
to their payments payment gateways

776
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,840
so the key for the lazarus is the

777
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,840
payment gateway still

778
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,840
so let's just briefly talk about the

779
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,799
lazarus

780
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,320
on its own so you might be familiar as i

781
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,279
mentioned like lazarus maybe like 20

782
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,080
different times so

783
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,559
lazarus actually is a way i separate and

784
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,840
many

785
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,279
many in our information security

786
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,559
communities separate them in two

787
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,200
different buckets

788
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,678
one is apt-38 which is the convention of

789
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,000
course

790
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,360
used by some of the big bender fire eye

791
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,400
it's the cyber crime group

792
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,199
blue north and apt-37 is the government

793
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,000
group rather

794
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,640
in dario and one of the whenever you see

795
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,279
the

796
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,400
news cycles about north koreans apt-3

797
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,080
hacking group behind

798
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,600
bank heist that's the group we're

799
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,158
talking about it's it's

800
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,240
the branch or part of the lazarus group

801
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,720
or linked to the lazarus group

802
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,159
the member of the biggest bank heist in

803
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,559
the world history

804
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,919
attempted one billion dollar transfer

805
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,760
from the bangladesh bank heist

806
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,799
attributed to the same group as we were

807
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,279
talking here

808
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,158
and this was 2016 in fact they stole 81

809
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,840
81 million

810
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,480
in the end where they tried to transfer

811
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,879
money from the banks into casinos

812
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,880
by uh getting access to one specific

813
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,640
engineer machine computer who had access

814
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,559
to swift gateways

815
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,400
uh they also spoofed as you see one

816
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,760
billion dollar of requests from

817
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
bangladesh central bank to federal

818
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,559
reserve of new york

819
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,719
to transfer money to accounts in

820
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,120
philippines and actually the only reason

821
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,840
why they got caught or rather the few

822
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,678
reasons about

823
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,199
how and why they got caught they got

824
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,559
caught because they misspelled one of

825
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,080
the recipients names

826
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,918
and they'll get and also get caught

827
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,399
because of course

828
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,080
irregularities across the huge swift

829
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,120
transactions

830
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,000
and also one of the unique things that

831
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,959
as we came out

832
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,760
that the south east asia banking attacks

833
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,600
also

834
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,360
they used they also helped north korea

835
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,080
withstand economic sanctions

836
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,039
so north korea sanction operates in the

837
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,799
very

838
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,720
different world as we are so they've

839
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,799
heavily sanctioned entity

840
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,480
by different uh regulators and

841
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,480
essentially they need to

842
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,559
bring the money back into their

843
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,480
government and that's where the nexus

844
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,360
come back and there's look for ways to

845
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,120
connect with the

846
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,158
financially motivated groups including

847
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,120
trigba and that's the group is uh

848
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,919
part of 2017 of course it's the focus on

849
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,559
swift

850
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,679
bank heist and then of course the u.s

851
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,360
sanctions and

852
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,840
attribution doj report came up later

853
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,439
essentially blaming one specific person

854
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,639
in north korea who developed both the

855
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,640
wannacry

856
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,240
ransomware that spread across the world

857
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,200
also linked him to

858
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,159
the operations uh of the bangladesh bank

859
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,000
heist

860
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,679
so pretty interesting uh indictment i

861
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,960
highly highly recommend you reading

862
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,520
actually in department of justice

863
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,840
website

864
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,960
looking into specific links uh that

865
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,520
attributed to that

866
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,880
for some person and and the actions

867
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,360
committed

868
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,240
another thing and so this is the apt-38

869
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,520
cybercrime group

870
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,520
another interesting links we've seen

871
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,960
earlier that no um

872
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,360
the apt-38 group also was linked to

873
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,440
ta-505

874
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,879
as well through distributions to

875
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,720
distribution chain

876
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,559
so they also connected to that group we

877
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,399
also know for a fact that

878
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,840
another company published also pretty

879
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,439
interesting uh

880
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,520
finding where they found additional

881
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,240
toolkits linked to the

882
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,399
another powershell tools attributed to

883
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,960
lasers also part of the environment

884
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,799
so apt-3 is pretty well connected but

885
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,720
not only they're well connected

886
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,960
they also might be in the same circles

887
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,279
where the criminals are

888
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,559
and that makes them pretty unique and

889
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,600
pretty interesting

890
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,000
another group is the apt-37 it's the

891
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,840
government

892
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,200
group it's the end aerial group as

893
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,279
attributed or

894
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,360
called by other you know vendors and

895
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:27,039
security information securities world

896
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,158
and uh do you remember the sony

897
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,240
there were there was a there was a

898
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,039
comedy so they basically operate

899
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,120
actually as

900
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:37,679
a as a as a as a attacks to

901
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,639
protect the regime or protect and maybe

902
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,360
censor in some

903
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,080
in incense effects in some shape or form

904
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,120
uh

905
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,000
the view on their leader of the country

906
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,320
so and also another interesting aspects

907
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,720
that

908
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,760
they also of course linked to the sony

909
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,600
hack intrusion

910
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,840
that's war in the u.s where they stole

911
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,918
so much uh so much data

912
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,959
and also came out with the guardians of

913
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,440
peace so they

914
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,039
they established a fake uh hacktivist

915
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,440
persona similarly as we've seen

916
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,720
the russian state groups use the uh

917
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,679
guccifer

918
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,159
as a fake persona as well to essentially

919
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,000
leak and pretend to be not the

920
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,000
nation-state group actor but also

921
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,520
just the hacktivist group so pretty

922
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,480
interesting and they actually focus

923
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,039
still on

924
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,080
south korea predominantly uh and also

925
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,720
the us of course

926
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,559
cpt-37 is also very very interesting but

927
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,640
this is the dissections in

928
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,480
within the groups on their own uh

929
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,320
relating to north korea

930
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,159
so going from the cyber crime linked

931
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,158
going and showing two intersections

932
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,840
shows like the unique diversity of the

933
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,960
group itself and what their interests

934
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,559
are

935
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,559
another kind of like reasonable question

936
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,080
is like how do they get so good like on

937
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,879
north korea on its own

938
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,399
so north north korea has basically two

939
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,200
internet connections

940
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,120
one is in china one is in russia and

941
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,919
they also have a soviet style training

942
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,678
program

943
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,679
which is it's quite good for

944
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,080
mathematicals in programming analysis

945
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,399
and

946
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,000
different technical tasks so kids with

947
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,959
mathematical aptitude are funneled

948
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,120
through select

949
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,640
middle schools top performers eligible

950
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,360
to attend either pyongyang

951
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,399
uh kim yunsun university or kim channel

952
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,080
university

953
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,678
and of course the military service is

954
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,960
the backbone of many

955
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,360
other countries operations and offensive

956
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,799
offensive operations are also other ones

957
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,320
that are facilitating

958
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:28,158
a lot of the activity around it and the

959
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,399
university graduates showing promise

960
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,279
also report to bureau 121 which is the

961
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,199
reconnaissance

962
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,640
general bureau advanced training also

963
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,640
provided in shenyang

964
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,399
also those with special attitude also

965
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,240
send to live in different countries

966
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,760
that's kind of the unique aspects about

967
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,240
the lazarus is that

968
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,960
we believe that there are accesses and

969
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,640
the people

970
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,320
linked to north korea actually operate

971
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,399
and live around

972
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,678
shell companies are all all over the

973
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:55,039
world and also

974
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,640
live around uh embassies linked to north

975
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,720
korea also all over

976
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,960
around the world this is kind of a

977
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,840
pretty interesting view on

978
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,480
why north korea and why north korea is

979
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,080
so good

980
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,120
dealing with cyber crime and getting so

981
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,199
well connected it's just because of that

982
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,399
unique backbone operations unique

983
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,480
mindset also

984
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,320
kind of closer to the soviet style

985
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,559
education programs

986
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,519
and this is what makes them quite unique

987
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,519
across the spectrum

988
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,120
and what's the outlook between uh

989
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,480
against north korea 2020 outside of even

990
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,760
looking into the trigbot

991
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,080
they've been doing they've been very

992
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,200
stealthy the apt-38 low and slow and

993
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,039
effective

994
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,360
there's of course this increased

995
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,200
interest in cryptocurrency

996
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,519
that's has been always been the flagship

997
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,960
operation for them where they targeted

998
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,360
many south korean cryptocurrency either

999
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,000
uh traders trading companies or

1000
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,879
cryptocurrency regulators or

1001
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,120
or other entities linked to large uh

1002
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,640
transactions or have access to multiple

1003
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,879
interesting cryptocurrency nexus on xi

1004
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,480
they also have access and due to small

1005
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,960
trial campaigns for ransomware where

1006
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,600
they

1007
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,120
play with venus locker in south korea as

1008
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,799
well which is one of the

1009
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,639
ransomware used by the group itself

1010
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,480
we also think that they will likely will

1011
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,440
maintain focus on large-scale

1012
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,120
monetary options uh with the some of the

1013
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,559
i guess of course focus on the revenue

1014
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,199
generation aspects

1015
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,840
so do you realize that swift swift

1016
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,960
gateways

1017
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,039
that's supposed to be the ways for them

1018
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,720
to transfer the most amount of currency

1019
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,640
and actually shows a pretty clever way

1020
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,760
of doing that how do you

1021
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,240
cash out one billion dollar the

1022
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,799
billion dollars basically i guess it's

1023
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,880
not easy

1024
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,799
actually if you look into that it's hard

1025
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,600
for you to receive a big

1026
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,960
uh payment even into the new let's say

1027
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,039
offshore company

1028
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,320
because like uh you need to have balance

1029
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,120
you need to have a history in that

1030
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,600
account

1031
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,320
to even uh receive like 10 million

1032
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,399
dollars

1033
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,519
so it's actually pretty complex but

1034
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,320
actually they found a pretty

1035
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,640
good way to cash out via casinos so

1036
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,320
casinos deal with lots of cash in hand

1037
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,720
they also deal with a lot of uh currency

1038
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,600
they're also not heavily regulated it's

1039
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,200
always in in the philippines where the

1040
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,039
casinos were and that's where they

1041
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,559
decided to pursue so pretty interesting

1042
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,919
pretty interesting idea from the cash

1043
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,240
out perspective

1044
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,600
is just to cash out one billion dollars

1045
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,640
via casinos

1046
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,279
and that's what they've been looking

1047
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,960
into the apt-37

1048
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,440
as i mentioned earlier remains focused

1049
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,960
on south korea and also remains focused

1050
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,679
on the u.s

1051
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,399
so some of the unique ways of of the

1052
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,480
research is

1053
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,158
that these goods are still active

1054
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,000
there's still actually increasing their

1055
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,240
activity in light of the

1056
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,440
worldwide elections there's additional

1057
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,360
reporting coming out

1058
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,640
on that soon but this is the current

1059
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,320
state of the groups as we know

1060
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,320
the impact of our research and the

1061
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,519
finding itself is that

1062
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,639
uh if you see the guidance of the north

1063
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,960
korean cyber threat

1064
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,840
if that's the time when the u.s cert

1065
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,960
established the

1066
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,120
finding saying is that they also believe

1067
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,360
that the cyber enabled financially

1068
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,199
financial fraud and money laundering are

1069
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,399
part of their operations and we also

1070
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,199
advise the united

1071
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,799
united nations council on on basically

1072
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,078
on the sanctioning of the north korea

1073
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,320
related to their

1074
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,079
crime operations so the research could

1075
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,280
extremely well impact on that

1076
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,800
side it just shows that how the hacking

1077
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,000
skills can be used

1078
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,720
to bring money back into the uh

1079
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,280
highly restricted and highly protected

1080
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,279
country

1081
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,720
and highly sanctioned country in the

1082
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,440
world so

1083
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,439
if you have high uh hacking skills and

1084
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,159
essentially very motivated in you know

1085
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,359
and you work for

1086
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,359
north korean government that would

1087
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,399
likely recruit you for bringing

1088
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,560
the money back into the currency

1089
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,319
and support the regime because that's

1090
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,799
what the their the major issue

1091
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,399
is across the lines just to support our

1092
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,359
allies in operations certainly north

1093
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,359
korea

1094
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,078
and that's where the impact of research

1095
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,400
came with

1096
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,320
so one of the unique things i guess that

1097
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,160
comes out of that kind of the idea is

1098
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,160
and we'll just show you a quick

1099
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,200
pretty cool tip like i want you to show

1100
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,839
like you know especially if you're

1101
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,160
working

1102
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,520
as a defender or attacker i want you to

1103
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,040
think about this as a

1104
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,720
moving way forward it's like if you play

1105
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,320
a chess with your enemy you need to take

1106
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,160
decisions faster as they are

1107
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,520
already in assume that their attack

1108
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,118
already happened of course

1109
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,040
assume that the worst scenario already

1110
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,800
occurred in this mindset allows you to

1111
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,920
take certain actions that you would you

1112
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,040
wouldn't otherwise

1113
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,280
but also allows you to see the

1114
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,320
conditional opportunities another

1115
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,000
idea i always say and i

1116
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,079
mentioned that something that you should

1117
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,480
be thinking of think like that

1118
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,920
just try to study them as they study us

1119
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,800
right so think think about the

1120
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,040
cybercrime

1121
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,800
mindset think about how they think try

1122
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,440
to be just in order to be ahead of them

1123
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,079
you need to

1124
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,920
think like that that's what the mindset

1125
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,640
and also the spirit of the conference

1126
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,680
itself

1127
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,520
we want you to walk away with so

1128
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,200
the future is of course one of the

1129
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,839
unique things i want you to recommend

1130
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,879
and just to

1131
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,640
walk away with uh is that

1132
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,400
i'll show you one unique tool an example

1133
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,359
how we caught some of the earlier

1134
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,960
samples

1135
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,000
related to the anchor bot and also found

1136
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,079
the nexus between

1137
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,920
the chimer groups in north korea and

1138
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,320
then of course linking

1139
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,440
uh the defensive searches and hunting in

1140
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,960
the network environments to the

1141
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,280
offensive operations where we

1142
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,880
we found the server that had the

1143
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,520
specific command and we

1144
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,560
pulled that command essentially but uh

1145
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,079
the yar hunting

1146
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,000
is actually the tool of course if you

1147
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,240
might be familiar with yara yari it's a

1148
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,400
swiss army knife basically a

1149
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,598
comp account very complex i don't want

1150
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,280
to reduce it to the

1151
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,200
regular expression but it's kind of like

1152
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,599
works as a

1153
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,399
pretty good searching engine search

1154
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,680
engine rather

1155
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,520
search language written in ruby um

1156
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,879
essentially used to to essentially write

1157
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,560
virus total signature

1158
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,640
inverse total signatures or many many

1159
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,920
other signatures media tools

1160
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,160
actually uh rely on yara signatures for

1161
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,560
for the operations and antivirus things

1162
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,000
think of yara as a static engine of many

1163
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,200
antivirus

1164
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,760
uh companies and antivirus engines

1165
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,598
so so the malware developers work just

1166
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,040
legitimate operators so legitimate

1167
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,720
software developers they want to

1168
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,480
automate repetitive tasks

1169
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,319
so they want to rewrite the same routine

1170
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,960
twice especially if it's something

1171
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,560
complex

1172
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,000
they also don't want it to they want to

1173
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,200
reuse as much code they already

1174
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,839
did before so especially

1175
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,200
for example the crypto routines nobody

1176
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,160
wants to copy

1177
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,200
or redo or rewrite md5 routine for

1178
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,920
example without

1179
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,680
of course external dependencies so

1180
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,560
there's lots of code you carry with you

1181
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,960
as a malware

1182
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,920
or as a regular software developer think

1183
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,920
of them as actually

1184
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,200
a regular software developers so as a

1185
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,720
regular stuff for developers they're

1186
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,040
most complex

1187
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,319
issues are the external dependencies and

1188
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,680
their external dependencies

1189
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,839
are their crypto routines

1190
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,440
cryptographical routines so sometimes

1191
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,359
the malware of course has ways to

1192
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,599
protect them from being analyzed

1193
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,759
so to protect against analysis they also

1194
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,040
use various algorithms including the

1195
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:08,880
most popular rc4 ap lib uh

1196
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,480
rsa etc aes so trigbet is the one that

1197
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,800
also using a very

1198
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,839
common ways to protect it oftentimes

1199
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,800
they rely on

1200
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:18,720
things like packers encrypters to

1201
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,640
essentially to hide the true binary

1202
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,399
and in fact only the last stage in

1203
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,440
memory at last second

1204
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,200
bypassing antivirus detection so from

1205
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,720
the malware hunting perspective and from

1206
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,919
defender side they'll knowing and

1207
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,680
studying what they do

1208
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,200
again thinking like them all is to

1209
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,359
create a search rules of course to

1210
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,118
detect this kind of code we use

1211
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,960
but the key aspects about the code we

1212
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,119
use and make long-standing and

1213
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,560
long-living yara signatures is that

1214
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,960
focusing on

1215
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,880
uh on the cryptographical aspects let's

1216
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,520
hunt for the crypto routines

1217
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,280
that i want to view to show you and one

1218
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,880
of the unique

1219
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,119
ways is and we'll start quite a bit is

1220
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,359
that the trick by the utilize has their

1221
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,280
own

1222
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,960
crypto server for some time and it's

1223
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,079
been quickly updated

1224
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,640
and one of the unique binary analysis

1225
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,520
you can do

1226
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,240
is just looking for the unique or common

1227
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,880
crypters across the malware samples

1228
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,479
and what the kind of crypto service

1229
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,760
services are actually help us to

1230
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,160
attribute certain

1231
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,800
operations of the groups so one of the

1232
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,000
latest version utilized the rc4

1233
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,920
which is the uh symmetric uh algorithm

1234
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,160
with a twist and also kind of like a

1235
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,960
perfect example when we wrote actually

1236
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,240
a full decrypting decrypter of trig but

1237
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,079
crypto sample

1238
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,759
so one of the one of the interesting and

1239
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,800
perfect examples to show you

1240
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,920
how you can use specific technical

1241
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,760
skills for good

1242
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,400
and for both for defensive and offensive

1243
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,480
purposes studying and learning the uh

1244
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,960
habits of the adversary and applying

1245
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,920
them in in our crypto routines

1246
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,839
and the example was that the s box so

1247
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,119
what they did essentially with the

1248
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:57,599
rc4 they they copy-pasted the same rc4

1249
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,839
routine into the all the malware samples

1250
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,960
but they added a null terminator in the

1251
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,319
key size

1252
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,119
and also they added different s box size

1253
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,839
and and knowing two unique things the s

1254
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,760
box size

1255
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,359
the unique null terminator and the

1256
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,839
specific snippets

1257
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,359
related to these also very i call the

1258
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,839
descriptor virtual alec

1259
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,520
x numa which basically the name that

1260
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:22,240
they use one specific api

1261
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,960
import they rely from the windows side

1262
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,959
which just

1263
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,240
makes them quite uniquely attributed to

1264
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,760
the group and

1265
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,598
in the quick er signatures you can see

1266
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,800
the language of yara the meta and

1267
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,359
strings

1268
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,640
simple but reliable and that's it simple

1269
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,880
itself in the concept

1270
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,560
used for hunting for anchor bots and

1271
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,839
connections so once identified the

1272
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,119
anchor bot we were looking into the

1273
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,078
server and server link

1274
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,640
led to the not lazarus connection but

1275
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,880
this is a

1276
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,560
pretty clever way for you tracing

1277
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,920
instead of focusing just on strings

1278
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,720
within the malware focus on

1279
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,640
cryptographical algorithms and focus on

1280
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,359
the routines that are

1281
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,279
detailing and kind of delving into the

1282
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,000
cryptographical implementations within

1283
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,599
the malware

1284
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,319
because that's where the unique aspects

1285
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,560
is very rarely even crime or operators

1286
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,520
and understand omar operators understand

1287
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,359
the uh

1288
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,880
crypt crypto very well oftentimes they

1289
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,720
just copy paste from

1290
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,720
uh different places including github and

1291
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,200
and many many others so you can always

1292
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,000
attribute to that

1293
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,399
and uh what are some of the interesting

1294
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,520
key takeaways and outlook i want you to

1295
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,119
walk away with

1296
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,119
then of course that we've seen and

1297
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,680
continue to see is the automations of

1298
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,160
malware

1299
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,440
what i mean by that is the the crime

1300
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,520
groups

1301
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,760
created ways to automate the malware

1302
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,440
distributions including spam bots

1303
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,520
and of course email spam plus

1304
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,839
interactive human exploitations

1305
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,720
so what they do is they hire people with

1306
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,599
skills

1307
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,000
to run various uh frameworks including

1308
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,319
actually

1309
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,680
they even exclusively now rely on

1310
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,160
various

1311
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,598
open or penetration tests and toolkits

1312
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,399
such as cobalt strike

1313
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,200
interpreter and and some other

1314
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,440
frameworks related to

1315
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,720
uh and of course powershell empire um

1316
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,880
related to the

1317
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,359
pen testing tools that's kind of the

1318
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,720
convergence of apt and crimeware from

1319
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,960
the operations side

1320
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,399
so the precursor of that is the malware

1321
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,160
operations and then

1322
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,240
there you see the penetration testing

1323
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,078
kits which is pretty

1324
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,520
uh pretty much the view of the

1325
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,040
intrusions and

1326
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,200
the deep dive into some of the

1327
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,640
intrusions uh intrusion reports we've

1328
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,200
seen earlier

1329
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,118
the also apt and issues the groups also

1330
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,439
tap into crimeware groups

1331
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,280
uh there is a interesting research nexus

1332
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,319
we found of course through the

1333
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,000
you first i guess we were the first ever

1334
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,720
who found that nexus

1335
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,560
between the trigbot anchor and the

1336
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,240
lazarus and it's not it was through

1337
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,839
technical evidence

1338
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,078
so the most high fidelity evidence high

1339
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,759
fidelity evidence we can ever obtain

1340
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,319
that uh provides high confidence

1341
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,160
assessment so it's no longer a gas

1342
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,920
game or it's a longer confidence but

1343
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,000
it's uh it's almost a certainty that

1344
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,839
they are linked through some operations

1345
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
or some some operator

1346
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,078
we know that north korea seeks ways to

1347
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,760
bring currency via crime groups

1348
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,599
pretty interesting way of thinking

1349
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,040
pretty interesting a way to employ

1350
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,000
hacking groups to

1351
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,520
essentially to sponsor their regime

1352
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,040
interesting ways of thinking but also

1353
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,359
instead of like them like seeking their

1354
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,240
own

1355
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,839
infections they're also relying on the

1356
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,200
some of the more interesting or some of

1357
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,359
the more established

1358
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,359
crime work groups such as strickbot and

1359
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:29,680
anchor those are the ones that operate

1360
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,799
predominantly in russia

1361
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,960
and those are the ones that they have

1362
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,480
connection with and then of course it

1363
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,520
has some major implications for national

1364
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,200
security and threats

1365
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,560
whenever you do instant response work is

1366
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,879
no longer

1367
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,839
enough just to dismiss certain factions

1368
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,319
as simply

1369
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,319
trigbot or simply imitate oftentimes

1370
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,920
they can lead to certain infections

1371
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,599
look at the profile of the company

1372
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,480
targeted see what

1373
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,359
the network parsing records would tell

1374
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,359
the actors

1375
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,960
about this company and that would be the

1376
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:59,040
way for us to be ahead of them

1377
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,240
the hunting approach for threats and

1378
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,400
practically and

1379
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,879
uh and of course by study attacker

1380
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,280
behavior is that yara hunting rules

1381
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,560
for cryptographical implementations and

1382
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,760
this was probably one of the most

1383
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,240
effective hunting

1384
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,240
approaches i've seen and used across

1385
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:18,000
many many many other

1386
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,240
samples and work i've done across the

1387
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,079
tracking malware threats in future cyber

1388
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,078
crime but the view of us

1389
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,000
is in the future is that by tracing

1390
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,079
understanding that that the

1391
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,920
threats are no longer not only not

1392
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,960
geographical but also

1393
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,040
they are um connected

1394
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,560
by targeting through different groups

1395
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,400
through different channels

1396
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,640
and also you know knowing ways to

1397
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,880
protect of course the rf signatures

1398
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,560
no known waste ahead of the threat would

1399
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,160
be the key forward

1400
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,240
and those are some of the key takeaways

1401
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,879
i want you to walk away with conference

1402
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,240
especially what as i mentioned earlier

1403
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,200
the theme of the conference

1404
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,720
is very close to my mind it's the

1405
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,919
convergence also

1406
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,160
of the uh offensive and defensive tool

1407
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,960
skills because i think this is also a

1408
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,200
necessary

1409
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,720
component going forward i believe that

1410
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,399
to be a great malware

1411
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,078
reverse engineer you have to be a great

1412
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,119
malware developer

1413
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,040
uh and to be a great uh again to be a

1414
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,839
great uh defender you have to be a great

1415
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,000
hacker

1416
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,119
and also play with your hats all the

1417
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,040
time and essentially

1418
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,640
provide a good line of feedback between

1419
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,480
those hats and it's it's almost like a

1420
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,240
left and right brain they should think

1421
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,760
together and should be connected in

1422
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,479
order for you to be highly

1423
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,520
successful at what you do this is the

1424
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,760
future

1425
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,520
i also want to thank some of the

1426
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,720
