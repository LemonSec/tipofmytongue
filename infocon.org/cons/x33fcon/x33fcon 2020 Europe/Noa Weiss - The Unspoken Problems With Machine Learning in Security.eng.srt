1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,480
hi everyone

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,480
i'm noah vice and uh today i'll be

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,720
talking about the unspoken problems with

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,720
machine learning and security

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,320
i'd like to thank all of you for joining

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,919
me and also

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,000
to thank this khan for having me it's a

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,199
great honor to to be talking on the

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,359
conference

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,920
hopefully next year we'll be able to do

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,960
this offline

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,960
so let's get started

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,719
so uh a little about me i'm

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,839
an ai and machine learning consultant

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,239
i've been playing with data for over a

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,399
decade both in the industry and academia

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,919
i've mostly worked in the risk and cyber

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,199
security domains

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,120
which i'm very fond of

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:00,000
and starting paypal then

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,519
i worked as a consultant for startups to

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,799
help them manage their uh

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,479
risk and uh lately i worked for

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,000
armies for those of you who've heard of

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,119
it

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,240
i also in my spare time i am a research

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,119
engineer in the deep

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,560
voice foundation where we try to utilize

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,799
deep learning technique

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,360
to improve whale research around the

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,159
world in order to protect and preserve

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,320
the whale population i'm also the leader

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,600
of the israeli community of women in

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,439
data science

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,119
and i mentor junior data scientists

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,119
taking their first steps in the field

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,799
and last but not least i'm the proud

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,000
owner

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,200
or proud human of those two adorable

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,640
cats say hi

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,079
and uh let's get to it

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,320
so the agenda for today

43
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,199
first since i'm claiming that we do have

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,079
unspoken problems in machine learning

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
and security then i'll try to

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,600
demonstrate that claim

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,320
we'll talk about whether the grass

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,039
really is greener

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,799
we'll do that by looking at machine

50
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,200
learning at other domains

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,560
where they're at and then when where

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,480
we're at

53
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,920
at security then we'll talk about the

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,920
things that hold us back

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,119
what are the causes for machine learning

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,040
and security

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,879
not being in the same level as some of

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,079
the other domains that utilize machine

59
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,560
learning

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,640
and then about possible solutions things

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,640
that i think we can do to change this

62
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,239
so if we split it up for

63
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,000
two three parts we basically have the

64
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,680
first part where we're talking about

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
are we lagging behind uh

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,200
once i demonstrate that whether you

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,400
believe me or not

68
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,000
we'll talk about why that is the case

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,280
and then what we can do about it and

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
just fair warning the first part is

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,560
mostly not about security i'll be

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,720
showing

73
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,159
other domains in order to demonstrate

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,560
capabilities that

75
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,239
the machine learning community was able

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,280
to get to

77
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,680
in those domains so i know this is a

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,519
security conference and a security talk

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,959
just bear with me i promise we'll get

80
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,480
there

81
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,480
so are we lagging behind

82
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,720
as promised let's take a look about

83
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,720
machine learning other visions

84
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,480
in other domains one of them being

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,040
computer vision

86
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,518
computer vision i assume most of you

87
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,040
know

88
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,120
is the domain where

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,319
basically anything image related is

90
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,120
concerned

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,480
and the the models the the algorithms

92
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,360
try to identify

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,119
images and perform tasks that have

94
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,599
something to do with those images or

95
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,599
videos

96
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,439
so computer vision today is quite

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,879
advanced it has quite a lot of

98
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,040
achievements

99
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,480
i assume most of you have heard of

100
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,640
autonomous vehicles

101
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,840
and though they're not yet fully

102
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,439
operative

103
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,040
mostly for legal reasons and reasons of

104
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,480
just

105
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,000
preparing the market for it we do have

106
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,039
today we have vehicles that are able to

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,959
drive

108
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,240
on their own and though they're not

109
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,680
perfect they

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,080
perform much better than human drivers

111
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,520
and that's a pretty amazing achievement

112
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,240
at least in my opinion

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,359
that that's something that we're able to

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,800
get to

115
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,639
um we also have facial recognition uh

116
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,479
which is very good the facial

117
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,600
recognition technology

118
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,199
is quite accurate um

119
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
it's not so much used in western

120
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:52,240
countries it's mostly used in china

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,880
um and it's uh protested by human rights

122
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,199
uh

123
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,360
organizations uh but if we're just

124
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,720
looking at the technology

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,320
uh aspect of it then it is

126
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,840
quite um an impressive achievement

127
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,199
regardless of whether it's used in uh

128
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,638
in a way that's this world

129
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,880
and then we have a generative ai

130
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,720
generative artificial intelligence which

131
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,719
is artificial intelligence or machine

132
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,759
learning that creates

133
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,080
new images new videos um we'll take a

134
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,400
look

135
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,919
at that so let's take a look at the few

136
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,560
examples as i mentioned

137
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,919
just to give you guys a feel you guys

138
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,360
and new girls

139
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:41,440
a feel of what what it is that we have

140
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,560
in computer vision today uh so first

141
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,520
first example is image completion uh

142
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,600
but the algorithm that created what i'm

143
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,599
going to show you right now is called

144
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,160
image gpt and it is given

145
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,960
an in incomplete image that it has never

146
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,960
seen before

147
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,560
and it's asked to complete it in a way

148
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,198
that makes sense

149
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,919
so here you can see a few examples for

150
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,319
that

151
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,639
on the leftmost column you have the

152
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,600
model input which means that the

153
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,960
the half image that the model got then

154
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,080
on the right hand

155
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,960
basically all the other columns except

156
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,479
for the

157
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,159
most right-hand one which is the

158
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,120
original anyway the middle

159
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,080
columns is uh what it's the model

160
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,360
outputs what

161
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,080
the model completed the picture as

162
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,199
and um you can take a look and you can

163
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,479
see what you think

164
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,560
i think it's pretty impressive

165
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,758
um and though they're not all winners

166
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,720
for example we have

167
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,120
the water droplet one that doesn't

168
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,720
really

169
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:48,880
make sense um they're pretty good

170
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,759
they're pretty good and pretty good in

171
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,240
rather difficult tasks as well you can

172
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,880
see

173
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,759
for example how it completed the shadows

174
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,800
of the people

175
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,479
on the first row in a way that's not

176
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,680
trivial

177
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,440
it also it's able to complete

178
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,000
images of things it has never seen

179
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,080
before even its concepts

180
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,360
um for example the elephant with the

181
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,120
butterfly wings

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,759
well the butterfly wings ears

183
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,720
and it deals with it in a way that uh

184
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,720
seems convincing

185
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,960
another example we can take a look at is

186
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,639
uh

187
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,239
the gogen algorithm

188
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,440
which is uh named after the painter

189
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,720
it's a a play on words because gan is

190
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,080
uh the name of uh that class

191
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
of algorithms and uh what it does is it

192
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,039
takes

193
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,840
sketches very basic doodles human

194
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,639
doodles

195
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,159
and creates very realistic photos that

196
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,360
are based off them

197
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:58,560
so i put this gif here just so you can

198
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,000
take a look and see how it works um i

199
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,800
normally hate gifts

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,560
so we'll move forward quite soon but you

201
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,759
can see how on the left side

202
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,680
what the person that drew that did is

203
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:15,120
created a very very basic drawing

204
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,319
and chose what they wanted to look like

205
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,680
for example

206
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,639
they drew that brown blob and they chose

207
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,080
rock

208
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,879
and the algorithm the model

209
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,240
just completes it into a beautiful

210
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,919
landscape picture that

211
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,080
seems very real you can see a few more

212
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:38,159
examples not by give

213
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,479
this of a mountain with a river

214
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,599
and the forest and we even have the

215
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,919
reflection of

216
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,519
all of it in the water uh which

217
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,920
originally it was just

218
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,640
a few blobs again a few blobs and the

219
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,560
person

220
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:56,880
chose that they wanted to be

221
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:01,760
a mountain and then water etc

222
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:05,519
here we have a waterfall quite beautiful

223
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,519
i wouldn't mind visiting that

224
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,640
and this um this model this algorithms

225
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,480
were first created by catherine nichols

226
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,519
which is a phd

227
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,160
in columbia university which which is a

228
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,360
lie

229
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,839
that is not the case um

230
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,959
this person does not exist and this

231
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,240
person is a picture

232
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,040
that i took from it's a photo a fake

233
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,640
photo

234
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,640
that i took from the website

235
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,360
dot www.thispersondoesnotexist.com um

236
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,120
which basically

237
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,240
has a a model that creates

238
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,440
one fictional person after another you

239
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,200
can see

240
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,000
a few more examples here

241
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,680
and they all look quite convincing uh

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,839
you can give it a try yourself

243
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,599
after this talk not during this talk

244
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,800
i'll be i'll be watching

245
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,880
you can type in and see

246
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,880
what what people you get um

247
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,560
they don't have to be people uh they

248
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,399
also have

249
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,279
other forms other uh fictional things

250
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,079
for example casts uh if you remember the

251
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,200
two cats

252
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:25,040
uh that i presented in my uh

253
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,519
first slide the they're they don't exist

254
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,839
they're not my cats i have no cats

255
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:34,720
uh they're uh photos that i took from

256
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,760
www this cat does not exist dot com

257
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,200
and it doesn't stop there you can get a

258
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,600
lot of fictional things

259
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,240
by the same basic algorithm different

260
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,600
models based off the same algorithm

261
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,079
you have www dot this person does not

262
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,120
exist

263
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,319
dot com you have this cat does not exist

264
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,839
this horse does not exist this artwork

265
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,640
does not exist

266
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,519
which i would say is less convincing

267
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,040
just because

268
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,720
abstract art in in its own

269
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,160
is sometimes look like something a

270
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,040
computer could do

271
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,000
and uh the most surprising this chemical

272
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,040
does not exist

273
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,160
which basically creates 3d

274
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,480
imaging of a molecule i'm i'm not a

275
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,640
chemist so i don't know if there's

276
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,600
anything there that i should appreciate

277
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,439
that the

278
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,120
model is able to do um

279
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,839
but you can check it out yourself and

280
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,839
see what you think

281
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,800
so this was a bit about computer vision

282
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,839
and where we are at there

283
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,000
where machine learning research is at um

284
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,200
with computer vision let's take a look

285
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,480
at another field

286
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,240
that's very hot right now the natural

287
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,399
language processing

288
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,600
usually called nlp for short

289
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,160
so natural language processing is uh as

290
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,279
the name

291
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,920
suggests um the processing

292
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,720
of natural language it's a machine

293
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,680
learning

294
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,720
trying to to understand and interpret

295
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,920
and work

296
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,680
with data that is simply a

297
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:17,279
human language and it has quite

298
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,680
um astonishing achievements um

299
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,480
just for example the fact that we have

300
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,199
today pretty good automatic translation

301
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,560
is quite incredible i mean i don't know

302
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,720
how many of you remember what

303
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,479
translations automatic translations

304
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,480
used to be like uh but

305
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,480
any of you who are bilingual can

306
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,720
appreciate

307
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,959
that an accurate translation or even a

308
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,959
semi-accurate translation is very very

309
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,399
hard to get to

310
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,920
even if you speak the language and then

311
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:53,120
having a model a computer

312
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,599
a script do it is quite impressive

313
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,480
um then we also have long-form question

314
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,600
answering

315
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,800
which basically means that

316
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,480
you can type in a question and

317
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,920
you would have the model search the web

318
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,320
get the relevant excerpts the places the

319
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,160
talk

320
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,560
about that question and uh be able to

321
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,199
take all of them integrate them and

322
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,760
provide an

323
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,880
answer provide an answer that summarizes

324
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,240
them in a comp

325
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,560
comprehensive manner um

326
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,240
which is something that a lot of people

327
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,119
i know aren't able to do

328
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,519
so it's pretty cool that the model can

329
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,800
do that

330
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,480
well last but definitely not least we

331
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,880
have gpt3

332
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,199
um i i assume most of you have heard at

333
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,639
least heard the name but that

334
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,680
might be just because i hang around

335
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,240
hang out with the other data scientists

336
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,000
and machine learning people all the time

337
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,360
so that's my own bubble um

338
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,360
let's take a look at what it is

339
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,600
so gpd3 is a language model

340
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,000
which basically means it's a

341
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,240
multi-purpose nlp model it wasn't

342
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,839
trained for what a specific task for

343
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,560
example it wasn't trained

344
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,760
specifically to translate from english

345
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,459
to

346
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,760
hebrew it wasn't trained to

347
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:27,760
[Music]

348
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,160
find entities into in a text

349
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,880
or to point out whether the writer of

350
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,920
the text

351
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,120
is spelling a specific sentiment uh it

352
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,560
was just trained on

353
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,880
language in general and can be used with

354
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,000
some fine-tuning or no fine-tuning at

355
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,439
all

356
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,760
for a lot of other stuff

357
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,279
and it's mostly generative usually what

358
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:54,639
it's used for is to generate new text

359
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,040
and it has astonishing performance um

360
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,079
don't take my word for it let's let's

361
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:04,000
take a look at a few things that he did

362
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:06,560
so one thing and i'm i'm really just

363
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,680
scraping the top here i mean i'll i'll

364
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,359
give you guys

365
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,079
and gals a few examples uh but i really

366
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,600
recommend

367
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:18,000
it later just google it uh

368
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,199
perhaps on twitter there's a lot of

369
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,240
examples for

370
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:25,040
amazing things that people did with gt3

371
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,000
um so one of those things is generate

372
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,759
code

373
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,120
uh there is one person that

374
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:38,399
after introducing dp3 to examples

375
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:41,759
of gs sorry of jsx code

376
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,480
got the algorithm to write

377
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,199
generate that code based on just a free

378
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,079
text

379
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,959
description and i want to be clear that

380
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,399
when i say that

381
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,399
the person introduced the

382
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,120
the model i don't mean that they train

383
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,519
them train the model for the task

384
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,240
um i won't go into the details right now

385
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,839
because it's

386
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,440
it's really not in the scope of that

387
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,199
talk of this talk

388
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,600
but um that that's a really big thing

389
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,240
that the model that was not trained at

390
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
all

391
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,560
to create that code was able

392
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,079
to take that free text description and

393
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,758
generate code which

394
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,880
uh though i haven't validated it myself

395
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,160
it's something on twitter it seems to be

396
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,519
pretty good code based on a

397
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,800
human free text language

398
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,839
description of the layout that the

399
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,160
person inputting this wanted

400
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,199
and it doesn't stop there it also

401
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,319
generated

402
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,920
machine learning codes uh it got a

403
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,079
description

404
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,160
of a machine learning model and it

405
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,319
created a code for that

406
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:57,360
which is a bit spooky i'm not gonna lie

407
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,079
i feel like this could be the start of a

408
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,639
horror movie but that's where we're at

409
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,638
at the moment

410
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,439
and another example that i really liked

411
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,280
is um

412
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,400
someone tried to uh to

413
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,879
give gp3 a job interview basic coding

414
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,280
phones

415
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,120
phone screen and as you can see the

416
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,520
person said that uh

417
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,319
though it can't quite pass a coding

418
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,319
phone screen

419
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,559
it's getting closer i'm going to show

420
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,399
you just a few

421
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:34,080
excerpts of those that i like um

422
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:37,200
so the human asked them even saying

423
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:41,199
nice it's a response to what the

424
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,600
ai previously did uh nice okay now write

425
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,200
code to remove all the even numbers from

426
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,559
an area of numbers

427
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:52,080
say ai ben says just to

428
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,918
clarify pretty good candidate

429
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,678
it sounds like i should remove all the

430
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,600
elements that are dividable

431
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:02,240
by two the human says yes and then

432
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,439
provides that the ai provides the the

433
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,919
code

434
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,200
they're they talk about this some more

435
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,600
and then uh

436
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,520
at the later point human says well you

437
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,159
don't need to do a g-sub at all try

438
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,039
doing it

439
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,120
without regular expressions and the ai

440
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,360
understands what that means and he's

441
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,159
able to take the code that it previously

442
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,639
wrote

443
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,919
and then change it to be without regular

444
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,280
expressions

445
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,120
um it does make a mistake there though

446
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,039
and the human asks does this does this

447
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,840
code return just the even numbers or

448
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,480
does it remove

449
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,399
all the even numbers the ai says it

450
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,120
returns just the numbers

451
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,440
again understand the question and is

452
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,280
able to answer that question

453
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,880
based on not only the knowledge and the

454
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,399
understanding of the question itself but

455
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,840
the context and the code that you

456
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,799
previously provided

457
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,959
the human with and then the human says

458
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,799
ah okay we wanted to remove all the even

459
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,400
numbers rather than returning them

460
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,559
can you write code for that and

461
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,080
again they i understand that and it

462
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,160
provides different code

463
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,280
it does have a syntax error as the human

464
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,559
points out

465
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,960
but it is a code that is has the same

466
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,039
goal

467
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,120
as the human requested and when the

468
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,000
human points out that

469
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,080
it has a syntax syntax error error then

470
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,559
the ai is able to understand that and

471
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:24,000
ask okay what i miss what am i missing

472
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,080
and etc etc um

473
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,039
you can look it up online later to read

474
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,559
the rest of it

475
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,559
i found it pretty astounding

476
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:40,400
um for the last example let's take it

477
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,559
take a look at google duplex um

478
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,679
some of you might have already heard it

479
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,639
it's not

480
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,320
that new which is also amazing in itself

481
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,080
basically google created what's supposed

482
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,879
to be a personal assistant for

483
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,559
phone reservations which means that if

484
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,520
you want to make an appointment or

485
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,720
reservation

486
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,600
at one of a few specific business sites

487
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,000
for example a hair salon or a restaurant

488
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,039
then it's able to call and make that for

489
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,760
you but

490
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,640
without a person on the other end

491
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,280
realizing

492
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,159
that they're talking to a machine um

493
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,158
they do it

494
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,280
they're they're able to tackle different

495
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,320
obstacles

496
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,120
that come up in the conversation and

497
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,158
they do it

498
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,000
with the state of the art natural

499
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,000
language processing as well as speech

500
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,280
recognition and generation

501
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,559
um so let's play the video

502
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:36,559
and uh just to make sure that you get

503
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,678
the person with the android

504
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:48,730
sign with the google sign is

505
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:54,019
the model

506
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:54,019
[Music]

507
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,320
i'll have something else here hi i'm

508
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,120
calling to book a woman's haircut for

509
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,240
our clients

510
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:06,320
um i'm looking for something on may 3rd

511
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,320
sure give me one second

512
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:15,200
or what time are you looking for around

513
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
at 12 p.m we do not have a 12 p.m

514
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,240
available

515
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,320
the closest we have to that is a 1 15.

516
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,320
do you have anything between 10 am and

517
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,639
uh 12 pm

518
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,840
depending on what service she would like

519
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,240
what service is she looking for

520
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,000
woman's haircut for now okay we have a

521
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,480
10 o'clock

522
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,840
10 a.m is fine okay what's her first

523
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,440
name

524
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,639
the first name is lisa okay perfect so i

525
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,039
will see lisa at 10 o'clock on may 3rd

526
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,200
okay great thanks great have a great day

527
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,200
bye

528
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,678
they also have a second phone call there

529
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,159
which is uh

530
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,280
kind of amusing i recommend watching it

531
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,640
later

532
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:06,559
again not during my talk um

533
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,120
gotta say that model is much better at

534
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,399
making

535
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,479
phone reservations than i am

536
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,080
okay so we talked about machine learning

537
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,280
at other domains let's talk

538
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,280
let's talk about security

539
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,158
let's start with the good stuff um so

540
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,600
the first is

541
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,000
there there are some significant

542
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,639
improvements in malware detection

543
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,480
uh most of you probably heard of the

544
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,360
next generation anti-virus

545
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,480
it uses lies as deep learning techniques

546
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,879
um

547
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,080
exploring the subtype of machine

548
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,400
learning

549
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,000
for malware detection and it really does

550
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,679
quite well

551
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,760
then there's also some promise for

552
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,000
network intrusion detection

553
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,600
uh it's not something that's prominent

554
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,840
in practice yet

555
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:58,879
but it is something to look forward to

556
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,918
however if you look at the field as a

557
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,720
whole

558
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,320
um most machine learning models in

559
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,080
security

560
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,320
have so so so performance

561
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,918
the machine learning in general also

562
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,120
only makes for a small part

563
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,000
of the core product usually which makes

564
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,520
sense

565
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
given its abilities

566
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,720
and in general data and machine learning

567
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,600
technology

568
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,559
are underutilized in the industry uh we

569
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,840
really

570
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,720
don't fulfill over the potential of what

571
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,720
we can do with it

572
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:41,039
uh to some to sum up this uh

573
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,600
this section of the talk uh what i say

574
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,440
is that uh we are lagging behind other

575
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,879
domains when it comes to machine

576
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,960
learning technology

577
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,840
uh how we use it and what we are able to

578
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,840
get out of it

579
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,120
so we talked about are we lagging behind

580
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,479
um i hope you're on the same page with

581
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,799
me

582
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,840
about that now let's talk about why that

583
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,840
is the case

584
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,479
so anomaly detection algorithms anomaly

585
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,600
detection algorithms are algorithms

586
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,760
aimed at identifying data points events

587
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,480
or observations that deviate from data

588
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,480
sets normal

589
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,960
they're very common in security

590
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,000
[Music]

591
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,360
i would claim they are probably

592
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,279
the the most common type of algorithms

593
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,559
to be used uh

594
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:39,600
in in security specifically to identify

595
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,279
risky activity transaction etc uh

596
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,639
the reason is first of all probably

597
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,600
because the algorithm

598
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,559
just really fits the business needs it's

599
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,439
an algorithm

600
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,760
aimed at finding anomalies and that

601
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,320
really helps when we're trying to

602
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,200
spot the the users that shouldn't be

603
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,080
there

604
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,840
or the permissions that are off for the

605
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,840
fraudulent transaction

606
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,520
also it's unsupervised machine learning

607
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,360
which means

608
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,200
that in order to create the model in

609
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,080
order to train it and have a working

610
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,880
model

611
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,960
you don't need labels for your data set

612
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,440
what that means is

613
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,919
for example if if i'm looking at

614
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,919
a set of transactions and i'm trying to

615
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,520
spot the fraudulent ones

616
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,200
i don't need to know in advance

617
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,360
in order to train the model i don't need

618
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,559
to don't know in advance which

619
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,158
of the transactions i have in my set are

620
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:43,600
the legitimate transactions

621
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:46,880
and which ones are the fraudulent ones

622
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,240
despite all that though um machine

623
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,400
learning algorithms

624
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,080
sorry anomaly detection algorithms are

625
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,039
not ideal for security

626
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,039
for a few reasons

627
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,439
first of all they have a really high

628
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,039
false positive rate

629
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,200
um false positive means that the

630
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,240
algorithm identified something is an

631
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,799
anomaly

632
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,480
or in our case identified a transaction

633
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,760
is fraudulent or

634
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,480
user activity as a

635
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,039
malicious activity when that wasn't

636
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,080
actually the case

637
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,480
and that's something that

638
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,678
is much more likely to happen when we're

639
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,400
talking about

640
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,720
security and the kind of tasks we have

641
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,000
for

642
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,120
models the reason is that while if i use

643
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,960
um

644
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,039
if i use anomaly detection in for

645
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,720
example manufacturing which is

646
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,720
a domain that where they use it

647
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,279
if i use it there then pretty much every

648
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,720
anomaly i find is an interesting one

649
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,159
if i want to make sure that every

650
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,320
product that comes out of the

651
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:54,000
manufacturing process

652
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:57,678
looks and acts as it should then

653
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,679
every every anomalous uh behavior

654
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,279
or uh characteristic of the product is

655
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,679
relevant

656
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,400
however if we're only trying to find for

657
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,559
example malicious activity uh

658
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,679
gym legitimate activity can also be

659
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,080
anomalous

660
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,320
so we do have a lot of false positives

661
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,399
there

662
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,799
and together with the higher cost of

663
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,480
errors than that we have in security

664
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,240
that's really a problem because what are

665
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,559
you going to do with it so

666
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,679
um will we just automatically block

667
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,760
every anomaly

668
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,360
which means that we will often block

669
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,440
legitimate activity

670
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,360
and that's not really a risk we can

671
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,320
usually afford

672
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,760
and on the other hand we have to wait

673
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,120
for manual review

674
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,440
if we want to make sure that every

675
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,678
anomalous every anomaly

676
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,559
is really risky or malicious before we

677
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,720
block it

678
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,000
a human needs to see it and that means

679
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,480
it's both expensive

680
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
in resources and that it's it adds a

681
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,360
significant delay

682
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,360
to uh to our system

683
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,240
another problem with anomaly detection

684
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,480
algorithms for security

685
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,600
is that since it's unsupervised the

686
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,159
so-called ground truth we use for it uh

687
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,520
are human design features what i mean by

688
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,159
that is that when we

689
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,760
come to look at our algorithms and and

690
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,799
check if they work

691
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:22,399
like they should um the

692
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:26,158
and also what the the model

693
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:29,360
trains on what it um uh

694
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:33,200
sets itself and its decision making

695
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,039
on is uh the features that we designed

696
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,200
the humans the data scientists or

697
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,760
analysts working on the project

698
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,720
and that means first of all that it's

699
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,440
prone to very prone to human bias

700
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,840
it also mean that uh we would usually

701
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,399
only spot modes that we already know

702
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,120
because these are the things that we

703
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,320
will

704
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,360
look at when we design these features

705
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,120
uh it's not a deal breaker that's a lot

706
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,199
of times that's the case with

707
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:06,000
machine learning but it does mean that

708
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,640
we are limited in some way as long as we

709
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
use that

710
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,000
that type of algorithm

711
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,320
another problem we have in machine

712
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,039
learning

713
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,000
and security uh which is rather a big

714
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,080
one is the change in environment

715
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
in other domains uh the environment is

716
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,360
mostly unchanging for example in

717
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,399
computer vision

718
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,399
if i have a model that

719
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,840
takes an image and says whether it's a

720
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,399
dog or a cat

721
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,320
dogs and cats are gonna look pretty much

722
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,959
the same

723
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,240
in nlp working with language while

724
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,440
language evolves

725
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,120
it's a very slow process it's not

726
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,559
something that's likely to

727
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:51,918
significantly change over a few years

728
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,720
however in security uh we have

729
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,919
constantly changing environment we have

730
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,279
new devices

731
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:03,440
we have new applications new protocols

732
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:05,520
and new everything basically

733
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,480
and that is really a problem for a

734
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,960
learning model because the model

735
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,159
what the model knows is what it already

736
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,640
saw it's what it

737
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,600
trained on and if it wasn't trained on

738
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,440
the right uh

739
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,678
data if you didn't see the right

740
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,120
environment when it was trained when it

741
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,880
was created

742
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,918
then it's going to be less accurate

743
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,919
in a new environment

744
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,919
another problem is an adapting adversary

745
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,120
that is a

746
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,799
serious challenge for us

747
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,959
as we become better at securing our

748
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,039
devices and our networks

749
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,279
the attackers on the other end become

750
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,480
better at outsmarting our defenses

751
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,760
um that this is not a new challenge that

752
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,480
we face with

753
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,799
uh but it's a problem that's uncommon in

754
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,000
most fields

755
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:58,960
for example in computer vision um it's

756
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,519
not only that cats and dogs stay pretty

757
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,519
much

758
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:06,080
the same uh they also don't try

759
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,000
to outsmart us and look different in the

760
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,279
exact ways

761
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,559
that would fool our models um

762
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,840
same with nlp language doesn't change

763
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:19,519
specifically in a way that would trick

764
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,399
gpt-3

765
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,720
it we have on the other end on the other

766
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,158
end

767
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,360
that uh the people creating what we're

768
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,399
trying to identify

769
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,719
are able to specifically

770
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,600
aim and change their behavior and their

771
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,320
tactics

772
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,320
in a way that would fool our algorithms

773
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:44,240
then we have tagging um just

774
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,039
mentioning again when i say tagging i

775
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,519
mean getting labels for a data set

776
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,760
uh i gave the example with the

777
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,320
fraudulent transactions earlier

778
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,519
another option is uh if we're looking at

779
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,840
the network

780
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,600
network activity if i'm monitoring a

781
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,080
computer network and i want to spot

782
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,120
malicious

783
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:07,120
activity it means being able

784
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,600
to say on each activity that i'm looking

785
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,760
at

786
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,760
if it was legitimate or malicious

787
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,440
so when we're talking about computer

788
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,640
vision nlp it's much easier to get

789
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,760
tagged data sets uh one reason

790
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,600
is uh that there are often public data

791
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,399
sets that are already created and shared

792
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,959
i'll i'll get

793
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,918
more to that later but in general it's

794
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,799
just

795
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,960
they're out there um if i want a data

796
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,240
sets of cats i can pretty much

797
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,519
search google for cat and most of it

798
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,200
would be accurate

799
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:46,480
i can also use crowdsourcing i can

800
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,679
use platforms like mechanical turk

801
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,480
and just give give my images to

802
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,240
people everywhere to tag if we're

803
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,640
talking about nlp

804
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,679
the the tag data sets are basically out

805
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,240
there because

806
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,720
it's based on language so i can just

807
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,080
work

808
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,720
on random tweets for tweet from twitter

809
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,000
i can download wikipedia and train my

810
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,600
model on that

811
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,120
uh i have plenty of data

812
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,120
and all of it is already tagged

813
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,279
and in security we can't really do that

814
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,399
and there are a few reasons for that

815
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:27,440
the first is expertise we do

816
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:30,399
need to really know uh

817
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,120
security in our domain in order to say

818
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,158
whether

819
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:38,158
an activity is malicious whether this is

820
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,279
a malware or a legitimate application we

821
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,200
can just

822
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,320
put it on mechanical turk and ask people

823
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,360
to do that

824
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,918
we also need context while a picture of

825
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,879
a dog

826
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,919
remains a picture of a dog regardless of

827
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,600
context

828
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,120
from looking at activities and i'm

829
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,158
trying to define if they're legitimate

830
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,239
or malicious

831
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,840
i really need to know the context i'm

832
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,080
take i'm talking about

833
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,360
which computer network was it what do

834
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,639
users do there

835
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,639
what it usually looks like

836
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,240
then there's also the problem of

837
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:13,119
confidentiality we provide services

838
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,158
for other people for other companies and

839
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,079
we need to keep

840
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,079
their data confidential we can just

841
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,720
outsource everything

842
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,960
uh or put it online for crowdsourcing

843
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,439
etc

844
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,960
and there's also the problem scale uh if

845
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,240
we're talking about

846
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,440
things like monetary and monetary

847
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,078
networks for example that's a lot of

848
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,599
data

849
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,480
in very short time and

850
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,960
inside that data we only have a small

851
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,159
part

852
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,280
that is actually malicious that's uh

853
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,280
an interesting activity an interesting

854
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,320
part of the data

855
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,639
so we need to go through quite a lot

856
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,000
of our big data sets in order to get

857
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,000
something that we can work with

858
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,079
and the bigger data sets do mean bigger

859
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,680
checking problem you can't

860
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,560
just take a subsample for example and

861
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,720
work with it

862
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,320
because as i mentioned before only a

863
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,359
small small part

864
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,760
will be uh the part

865
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,759
that we're at we actually want the model

866
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,320
to be able to recognize

867
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,040
um this also brings me to the to the

868
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,240
next problem which is imbalanced classes

869
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,000
imbalance classes uh is what we we call

870
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,520
the problem where different classes in

871
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,640
the data are extremely

872
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,079
over underrepresented for example if you

873
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,520
look at the image

874
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,760
let's say that one is legitimate

875
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,119
transactions and two would be fragile in

876
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,520
transactions

877
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,119
that image is even a much better case

878
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,640
than what you usually have

879
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:51,839
usually we would only have a fraction

880
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,920
a tiny fraction of the data

881
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,240
being malicious activity the activity

882
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,760
we're trying to spot

883
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,439
and that's really a problem because

884
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,320
machinery models

885
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,599
are basically all of the suspect the

886
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,040
statistic

887
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:10,320
the statistics behind it and

888
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,640
the math behind it relies on classes to

889
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,040
be

890
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,319
pretty much the same they don't have to

891
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,440
be exactly equal

892
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,480
but extremely imbalanced data sets

893
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,920
uh mostly results and poor predictive

894
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,240
performance of the model

895
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,960
especially for the minority class or

896
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,799
classes

897
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,040
which are the ones that we're trying to

898
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,040
spot

899
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,480
this is a major problem when we're

900
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,680
aiming to identify

901
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,119
fraud fraud or attacks or malware or

902
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,240
anything of the sort

903
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,800
and well there are some common solutions

904
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,919
they are limited and do not fully solve

905
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,359
this problem

906
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,320
um we i don't want to go into

907
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,040
into the solutions too much just uh

908
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,760
basically

909
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,440
we can oversample or under sample we can

910
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,680
create synthetic data

911
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,359
there are methods to deal with that but

912
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,919
they're just not as good

913
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,920
as having the actual data

914
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,400
another thing that we have on our

915
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,200
characteristic of security that's

916
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,320
different from other domains

917
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,759
we have a very uh very high need for

918
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,079
explainability

919
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,240
and well it's not unique to security it

920
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,599
is something that sets the part from

921
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,000
most domains

922
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,680
um the reason that that's important is

923
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,040
that

924
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,200
everything i showed you basically in

925
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,800
computer vision or nlp is it based on

926
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,319
deep learning techniques

927
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,160
deep learning i mentioned it earlier

928
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,000
it's a subtype of

929
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,078
machine learning it's based on

930
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,160
artificial neural networks

931
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,839
it's a very computationally expensive

932
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,319
those are models that are very hard to

933
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,119
train

934
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,400
they require a lot of data a lot of

935
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,400
resources

936
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,520
but the they get quite astounding

937
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,960
results

938
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,560
so a lot of the uh cutting edge

939
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,400
technology and achievements that the

940
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,880
machine learning world was able to get

941
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,839
to

942
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,880
was based on deep learning techniques

943
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,759
the problem with the deep learning

944
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,480
techniques

945
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,040
is that they are considered black boxes

946
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,240
we don't really have an explanation

947
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,560
for the why the model uh chose what it

948
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,359
chose why it decided what it decided for

949
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,520
the output basically

950
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,799
and in security we really need

951
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,480
explainability

952
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,320
uh if i'm gonna block this user activity

953
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,800
i need to be able to say why

954
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,000
even if i'm not blocking it

955
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,400
automatically but

956
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
i'm asking an analyst to review it and

957
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,839
take the decision

958
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,119
it's much harder for the analysts to do

959
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,920
that if

960
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,800
they don't know what was the reason this

961
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,240
activity was spotted in the first place

962
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,599
and again well we do have that in other

963
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,479
fields for example

964
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,000
uh a lot of the machine learning in in

965
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,440
the health domain

966
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,720
has a similar problem not not exactly

967
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,280
the same because they

968
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,480
don't have they don't need to respond so

969
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,240
quickly

970
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,960
um it is mostly prominent in security

971
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,959
from what i see

972
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,560
now this is not a deal breaker uh

973
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,119
deep learning could still be used we've

974
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,160
added unexplainability models

975
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:25,440
uh it's a rather new field uh the

976
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:29,359
the the whole area of trying to

977
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,839
explain deep learning in retrospect

978
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,880
so there are some solutions but they are

979
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,599
far from perfect

980
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,480
and they are very complex to apply so it

981
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,599
makes sense

982
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,440
that it will not be the go-to option

983
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,240
for most data science and machine

984
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,240
learning teams

985
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,720
another problem we have is

986
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,160
confidentiality i mentioned it a bit

987
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,879
earlier in talking about tagged

988
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,960
data sets and if we compare this to

989
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,079
other domains

990
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,119
one of the main things that really

991
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,240
allowed

992
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,319
for example computer vision and nlp to

993
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,319
get to where they are today

994
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,599
is the fact that a lot of the data sets

995
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:11,040
are public

996
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,200
and that really allows having public uh

997
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,800
baselines or benchmarks

998
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:20,640
um it basically means that when i have

999
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,480
a new algorithm or a new method

1000
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,879
that i tried i want to share it with the

1001
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,800
world i can test it

1002
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,800
on data sets that are already known to

1003
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,000
other people in my field

1004
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,560
and i can show that my model really

1005
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,680
reached a better score or didn't and

1006
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,319
then i know that it's

1007
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,960
maybe not as good and it's a way to

1008
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,520
really show

1009
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,200
you work and create an active and a

1010
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,880
fruitful discussion

1011
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:52,560
on different ways to approach a problem

1012
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,520
also other fields mostly computer vision

1013
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,720
and nlp

1014
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,640
have publicly released trained models uh

1015
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,680
for example gpt3 that i showed you

1016
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,799
earlier it was created

1017
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,839
by openai which has a lot of funding and

1018
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,520
worked on it for quite a lot uh with a

1019
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:12,640
lot of resources

1020
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,359
and then it was well

1021
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,118
partially published but published for

1022
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,640
the rest of the world to use

1023
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:24,400
uh it's the same with a lot of uh

1024
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,960
the most famous nlp models such as bert

1025
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,119
i won't go into name names because it's

1026
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,560
probably not relevant for most of you

1027
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,560
but this really helps basically the

1028
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,680
entire machine learning community to

1029
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,799
utilize

1030
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,919
and and using their work the

1031
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:45,680
products of other people's work that

1032
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,680
they are willing to share with the world

1033
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,078
and all of those things enable not only

1034
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,480
direct revelation

1035
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,560
collaboration but also uh a way to

1036
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,319
compare new methods and algorithms as i

1037
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,880
mentioned earlier

1038
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,800
on the other hand in security we are

1039
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,880
bound by confidentiality

1040
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,839
uh we can't just share everything that

1041
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,800
we have

1042
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,680
and unlike other domains which might

1043
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,680
have

1044
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,279
like that same problem we also don't

1045
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:16,640
have any natively public data available

1046
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,560
for example say that i'm providing

1047
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,520
services to your construction

1048
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,960
construction construction companies

1049
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:28,480
in that i take

1050
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,680
the pictures of construction sites and

1051
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,280
use that to estimate the

1052
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,960
the current status of the project

1053
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,200
so in that case as well i'm bound by

1054
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,440
confidentiality

1055
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,480
i won't just take that data and share it

1056
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,160
with the world

1057
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,240
but i can get different data to work on

1058
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,440
in general pictures of construction

1059
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,240
sites are

1060
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,960
things that are achievable and on the

1061
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,680
other

1062
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,119
on the other side what we have in

1063
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,160
security

1064
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:03,280
uh again if i'm talking about

1065
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,640
uh fraudulent transactions there aren't

1066
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,599
just there isn't transact

1067
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,319
transaction data just out there in the

1068
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,880
wild

1069
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:14,000
um same about monitoring computer

1070
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,319
networks uh specifically malware is some

1071
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,040
somewhere something that is more

1072
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,680
available

1073
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,279
and maybe that's also part of why we're

1074
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,839
able to

1075
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,880
make much better progress in this field

1076
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,799
but mostly

1077
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:32,480
the data is not out there

1078
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,480
and it's not something that we can share

1079
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,759
there are a few publicly available data

1080
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,200
sets

1081
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,920
i do want to mention that but there are

1082
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,759
few they are small and they're outdated

1083
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,760
so it's not really something

1084
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,760
we can base our work on

1085
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,760
and i want to share with you a quote

1086
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,960
in uh in a paper that reviewed the

1087
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,000
current machine and deep learning

1088
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,359
techniques

1089
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,359
in the security industry

1090
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,240
many researchers are struggling to find

1091
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,839
comprehensive and valid data sets

1092
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,680
to test and evaluate their performance

1093
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:12,160
techniques and having

1094
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,118
a suitable data set is a significant

1095
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,118
challenge in itself

1096
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,480
in order to test the efficiency of such

1097
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:22,078
mechanisms

1098
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,079
reliable data sets are needed that one

1099
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,839
contain both the nine and several

1100
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,960
attacks two

1101
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:32,000
meet real-world criteria and three are

1102
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,000
publicly available

1103
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,599
again that is a real problem that really

1104
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,118
limits our ability

1105
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:45,040
to cooperate in order to

1106
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,040
move forward with this technology

1107
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,000
so we discussed the first two sections

1108
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,960
we talked about

1109
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,359
uh are we lagging behind we're talking

1110
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,480
about

1111
00:44:53,359 --> 00:45:05,359
why we are lagging kind and let's talk

1112
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:09,119
about what we can do

1113
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:12,240
so the first thing that we can do

1114
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:15,440
in my opinion uh to

1115
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:18,879
help move ourselves forward

1116
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:22,560
is public data sets if we have those

1117
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,440
it will really really help us cooperate

1118
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,200
on stuff even

1119
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:30,079
not directly and really create a more

1120
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,960
active discussion that we can use to to

1121
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,240
improve

1122
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,079
our algorithms our models or methods

1123
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,839
that would also allow us to have

1124
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,200
benchmarks

1125
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:44,799
which again is an excellent and

1126
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:49,118
necessary way to compare new algorithms

1127
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:52,000
not only within the same camp company

1128
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,839
and the way to get to those two first

1129
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,920
steps in my opinion is having direct

1130
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,960
collaboration between different security

1131
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,240
companies

1132
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:03,680
for that goal um having

1133
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,560
companies come together in order to

1134
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,598
create

1135
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,480
those data sets uh and share them with

1136
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,839
the world

1137
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:15,440
and then really create that

1138
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:17,599
base that we need that the most

1139
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,480
basic layer that we need in order to

1140
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,720
create everything else on top of that

1141
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,480
i think that would really help push us

1142
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,879
forward

1143
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,400
in general those all those three steps

1144
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,839
would allow us to encourage an

1145
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,280
active discussion and indirect as well

1146
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:36,000
as direct collaboration

1147
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,960
in the public domain resulting in faster

1148
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:43,839
better progress

1149
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:43,839
for the security domain as a whole

1150
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:51,280
to wrap things up we talked about

1151
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,359
uh are we lagging behind i showed you

1152
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,800
examples of what we can do with computer

1153
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,680
vision and

1154
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,440
natural language processing um again

1155
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,160
those are just a few examples just to

1156
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,760
get you the

1157
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,759
general sense of course it's harder to

1158
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,520
really compare when we're not talking

1159
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,760
numbers but since

1160
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,400
uh those are very different domains with

1161
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,040
different tasks and different data

1162
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,680
it's hard to it's not something we can

1163
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,119
really do

1164
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:21,919
compare numbers um so i hope that you

1165
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,319
get the general gist of it

1166
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,280
and so we talked about how machine

1167
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:28,800
learning

1168
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:31,280
is lagging behind how we're not really

1169
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,800
where other domains are with machine

1170
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,040
learning

1171
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,200
and then we talked about why that is the

1172
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,359
case we talked about a few problems a

1173
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,078
few challenges that we have in getting

1174
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,400
where we

1175
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,920
might maybe could be about anomaly

1176
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,920
detection algorithms

1177
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:50,480
and why though they're used quite a lot

1178
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,599
in the industry whether they might not

1179
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,680
be ideal

1180
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,200
talked about the problems of tagging of

1181
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,359
the changing environment

1182
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,359
of the adapting adversary

1183
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,520
some other things that are relevant and

1184
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,558
last but not least we talk about what we

1185
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,040
can do

1186
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,240
those are my own suggestions suggestions

1187
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,520
and opinions

1188
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,919
um i would love to hear

1189
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,680

or opinions

1191
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,960

1197
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,839

the best way to create an active

1199
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:42,000
