1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,320
this is

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,799
my talk opsec obsessed and it's about

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,800
making good opsec decisions at work

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,880
this is me um i work as a red teamer at

5
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,119
general electric

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,720
i live in richmond virginia in the

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,040
united states

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,920
and i've done a pretty wide variety of

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,760
offensive security stuff i did

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,640
vulnerability research for a while

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,480
on a pretty wide variety of things um

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,879
mostly web apps but also some

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,480
like embedded system and products which

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,718
is pretty fun

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,120
i led a team for a while doing

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,440
vulnerability scanning

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,160
and now i'm on ge's red team and i hack

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,519
things

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,480
and i do long term adversary emulation

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,640
emulation

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,000
um at ge i have to do like a little plug

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,159
for our red team just because i think

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,520
what we do is really cool

24
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:13,680
we basically run like a continuous apt

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:17,759
operation against our own company and

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,759
we have a fun time doing it so

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
generally i like to think of myself as a

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,040
hacker jack of all trades

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,720
which is just shorthand for not really

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,200
an expert at anything

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,520
but i like to say i'm a jake of all

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,520
trades

33
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,158
all right um so

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,479
red teams are really into opsec which

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,280
can be pretty annoying to

36
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,960
everyone else that has to deal with us

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,799
so this is a screenshot i took from

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,119
urban dictionary

39
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,560
opsec is short for operational security

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,240
and to really

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,759
really oversimplify opsec in short i can

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,759
say it means keeping stuff secret

43
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,199
i did leave in the ad here because i

44
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,159
think it's a really good ad

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,719
in the screenshot assuming that i have a

46
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,119
boyfriend

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,318
named manly which is a pretty great name

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,800
if you were going to have

49
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,280
a boyfriend obsessed with opsec manly

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
would be a good name for them

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,239
so i want to start off by talking about

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,480
what this presentation isn't about

53
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,920
this isn't a technical presentation and

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,879
it's not going to be teaching you

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,958
anything new

56
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,760
about hacking or how to do uh

57
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,200
opsec technically um this is a

58
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,879
presentation about people

59
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,399
and about groups and about keeping

60
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,440
secrets at work

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,080
and hopefully i will be able to improve

62
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,680
your team your red team's opsec by

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,560
framing a new way that you can think

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,000
about

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,080
or some new ways you can think about

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,560
that that subject

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,239
and um the last kind of disclaimer i

68
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,440
want to put in here is that this is from

69
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,400
my vantage point

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,760
on an internal company red team i don't

71
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,040
really have any experience

72
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,040
working uh in like a client based model

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,599
um so if you have a different red team

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,200
experience or if you have a different

75
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,679
um take on

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,200
on the the points in my talk from from

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,000
coming from a different background with

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,040
red teaming

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,879
i'd love to hear from you so

80
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,560
you know either during the talk in the

81
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,679
comments or afterwards hit me up on

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,879
twitter we can

83
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,560
we can talk about it um

84
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,000
and the last point i'll try to be

85
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,239
attentive to chat and

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,319
and read it but i can't make promises

87
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,360
that i won't get distracted by

88
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,359
my slides and my notes

89
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,040
all right so let's jump in uh when i

90
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,599
said that red teams are really into

91
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,640
opsec

92
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,440
i mean sometimes we're like really kind

93
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,920
of way too

94
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,200
into opsec and it can be weird and

95
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,760
prompt skepticism

96
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,839
from people who are outside of this

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,640
particular discipline sometimes from

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360
blue teams and i think that skepticism

99
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,079
is

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,159
is often justified

101
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
um maybe our obsession as red teams with

102
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,399
opsec is good

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
um maybe sometimes it's bad so we're

104
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,720
going to talk about that today

105
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,200
and i'm going to start by getting us all

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,159
on

107
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,958
the same page by defining opsec a little

108
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,918
bit more

109
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,798
rigorously we're going to start with

110
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,798
this definition

111
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,960
optic is a process according to the army

112
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,479
specifically according to the us army

113
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,599
regulation 530

114
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,599
tac one

115
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,800
so here's a longer definition

116
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,320
i'm going to read this whole thing i

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,479
promise you this is the only time i'm

118
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,400
going to read directly

119
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,840
from read two paragraphs from my slide

120
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
that's not what this presentation is but

121
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,679
i am going to do it this once

122
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,120
because i think it's a really good

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,440
definition

124
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,240
and i think that keeping this definition

125
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,280
in mind is it's a useful piece of

126
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,800
information to have

127
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,799
so here goes

128
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,400
in concise terms the opsec process

129
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,600
identifies the critical information of

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,638
military plans

131
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,280
operations and supporting activities

132
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,759
and indicators that can reveal it and

133
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,799
then develops measures to eliminate

134
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,000
reduce or conceal those indicators it

135
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,759
also determines

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,360
when that information may cease to be

137
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,320
critical in the lifespan of an

138
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,520
organization's

139
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,520
specific operation

140
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,758
critical information is information that

141
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,758
is vital to a mission that if an

142
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,880
adversary obtains it

143
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,199
correctly analyzes it and acts upon it

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,520
the compromise of this information could

145
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,400
prevent or seriously degrade

146
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,400
mission success

147
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,719
yes amen very funny

148
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,719
so um

149
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,440
we can modify this slightly for red

150
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,919
teams and and blue teams obviously it's

151
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,880
not about military plans it's about our

152
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,240
plan as a red team and um you know the

153
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,919
adversary

154
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,440
when you're on a red team you kind of

155
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,960
flip it the blue team's the adversary

156
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,960
the company's the adversary um

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,360
but it's uh it's a good definition so

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,360
let's talk about how to use it

159
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,800
now there's lots of ways that i've seen

160
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,240
opsec used

161
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,120
during my career as a red teamer um

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,039
for us on any given engagement uh our

163
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,360
red team tries not to get caught so we

164
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,479
we choose our ttps carefully

165
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,319
we think about how to avoid um you know

166
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,520
alerts from whether it's like hips or

167
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,360
edr

168
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,120
we're mindful of what kinds of logs we

169
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,080
might be generating

170
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,520
um we try to you know before we take an

171
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,400
action we try to think like what is this

172
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,639
going to look like

173
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,799
to a sock analyst or someone who's

174
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,080
investigating it

175
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,400
we use other technical controls like

176
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,479
compartmentalization

177
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,560
you know using different techniques in

178
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,000
different places different access in

179
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,199
different places

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,560
to prevent a discovery of one piece of

181
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,520
our infrastructure or one of our

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,039
techniques getting

183
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,400
getting identified from burning down

184
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,960
our our entire operation

185
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,599
but those are technical things we also

186
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,560
do some non-technical things

187
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,680
for starters we don't tell the people

188
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,960
being assessed

189
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,520
that they're undergoing an assessment

190
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,159
we don't tell blue team what the target

191
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,080
or goal

192
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,840
of our engagement is

193
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,159
in fact we don't really tell our blue

194
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,599
team much of anything before we start

195
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,680
a red team engagement we don't tell them

196
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,800
the target the ttps what hosts we're

197
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,599
going to be on

198
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,599
when we're doing it why we're doing it

199
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,719
basically nothing

200
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,440
and when we do finally issue a report we

201
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,440
also

202
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,000
don't issue a full comprehensive report

203
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,199
that has like

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,800
every technical action taken you know

205
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,639
with time stamps

206
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,280
um we actually leave out a lot of the

207
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,199
stuff that isn't directly relevant

208
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,719
to um solving

209
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,479
whatever problems we're trying to

210
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,680
identify or solve

211
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,758
or um details that are

212
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,680
that are irrelevant or contrary to to

213
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,960
our goal or strategy

214
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,319
so basically what i'm saying is that we

215
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,400
keep a lot of things secret

216
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,599
now that's how we do things but you

217
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,840
could also imagine

218
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,000
a model where you just didn't do any of

219
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,760
that you didn't keep those things secret

220
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,440
you could collaborate with blue ahead of

221
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,399
time to pick a target

222
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,279
you could pre-define what ttps were of

223
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,399
most interest

224
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,800
and test those specifically you could

225
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,800
let the blue team or other stakeholders

226
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,719
know that you're going to do testing

227
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,839
before doing testing

228
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,760
you could you could provide a

229
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,240
comprehensive report with every action

230
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,360
taken

231
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,839
full of every you know exact syntax of

232
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,800
every

233
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,800
procedure call made

234
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,800
and some organizations do do that

235
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,319
some organizations use more secrecy and

236
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,399
some use both at different times

237
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,440
there are pros and cons to each method

238
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,279
so i want to

239
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,200
kind of introduce an analogy here of

240
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,560
thinking

241
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,839
of one method as being

242
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,319
more like internal audit versus the

243
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,560
other

244
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,000
you know more opsec heavy method of

245
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,160
being more like doing

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
investigative journalism if you're

247
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,800
working with blue

248
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,640
in conjunction with blue to you know

249
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,680
find issues you're acting more like

250
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,959
internal audit

251
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,519
and if you're working independent of

252
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,839
blue you might be more like an

253
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,920
investigative journalist

254
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,000
they're both valuable and they can both

255
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,680
provide a lot of value to a security

256
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,120
organization

257
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,599
and so i want to ask the question

258
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,440
how do we make a decision about which to

259
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,160
use

260
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,959
i think it's safe to say that neither

261
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,719
model is

262
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,518
wrong but in general i do think the more

263
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,200
mature

264
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,640
your blue team and your defensive

265
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,480
capabilities are

266
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,399
the more time you can spend doing those

267
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,120
opsec heavy engagements and getting some

268
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:19,839
of the benefits that you can only get

269
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,839
from doing those opsec heavy engagements

270
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,160
okay um i want to do a poll of the room

271
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,480
here

272
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,800
i'm not sure what the quickest way to do

273
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,560
that is maybe dorota you can help me

274
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,000
i just want to see like if i was in

275
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,399
person i would say like i want to see a

276
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,399
show of hands of how many

277
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,640
blue teamers have heard something like

278
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:46,800
this from a red teamer before

279
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:49,680
one of these questions on the slides

280
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,000
for you it should be like one minute or

281
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,000
something

282
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,090
[Music]

283
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,640
okay

284
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,600
so i can talk a little bit more while

285
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,199
you do that um

286
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,720
i do want to say it it doesn't feel

287
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,959
great to be told no

288
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,959
and red teamers should be very cognizant

289
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,839
of that when keeping things secret

290
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,040
because

291
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,839
you know for optic reasons um being

292
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,519
secretive

293
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,880
can make others feel like you don't

294
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,640
trust them or

295
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,240
being secretive can make others feel

296
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,760
like they don't have membership

297
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,279
in your group and i don't mean

298
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,000
membership on the red team

299
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,920
or on you know your specific team or

300
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,839
however like that i just mean like

301
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,279
um people in an organization feel like

302
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,560
they have group membership in that

303
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,880
they're working together

304
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,079
and when you keep secrets from them you

305
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,519
you can

306
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,279
cause hurt feelings because of um

307
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,880
you're kind of interrupting the the

308
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,560
normal behavior

309
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,320
of that group and challenging that group

310
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,560
membership saying i'm not going to tell

311
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,560
you

312
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,000
um

313
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,560
so that doesn't mean that uh we can't

314
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,040
use

315
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,800
secrets at work uh but it does mean that

316
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,560
we when we do that we should do so

317
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,319
correctly and so

318
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,638
um i'm going to break out correctly

319
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,079
in this case to mean when you do keep

320
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,399
something secret because of opsec

321
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,359
you should try to meet at least two

322
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,959
criteria

323
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,040
which is you should be justified in your

324
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,839
decision it should be made for a reason

325
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,120
and you should be transparent about why

326
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,600
things are

327
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,519
some things are you know behind that

328
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,519
that wall of oh i won't tell you that

329
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,200
so i do want to take a look at a quick

330
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,200
poll if that's possible before we move

331
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,360
on

332
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,760
right then start your voting

333
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,760
all right

334
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,600
jake do you see uh the responses or is

335
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,880
it just me

336
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,000
that let's see this uh on my screen i

337
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,120
actually see

338
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,079
the the poll itself okay

339
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:21,040
okay we have ten percent of people who

340
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:35,839
did the service so let's give it a bit

341
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:35,839
more time

342
00:13:51,600 --> 00:14:03,839
yeah i guess just don't answer if your

343
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:03,839
answer is no

344
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,760
we have nineteen percent how long do you

345
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,160
wanna wait to take

346
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,880
uh we can we can wrap it up now i mean

347
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,000
if you're

348
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,360
too slow miss out um

349
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,480
yeah and that's a really good good um uh

350
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,760
point the person instead just

351
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,519
somebody in chat pointed out that that

352
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,199
last one is kind of different not

353
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,199
deconflicting your activity is very

354
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,800
different than not sharing the ttp yes

355
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,800
it is

356
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:40,719
and it would result in a very different

357
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,719
kind of behavior from

358
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,079
from your defenders right and that could

359
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,760
cause

360
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:53,120
problems if you did that as well um

361
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,839
we actually have tried doing that at our

362
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,360
um you know red team of not not

363
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,199
immediately deconflicting

364
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,399
even when asked that did have buy-in

365
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:08,240
of of our our cert

366
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,839
senior leadership and

367
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,279
it was definitely interesting as an

368
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,720
experiment to see

369
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,720
what would happen it definitely

370
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,720
drove some different behavior of getting

371
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,369
the responders to respond

372
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,480
more thoroughly more completely

373
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,639
[Music]

374
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,399
because they weren't able to stop their

375
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,279
their response um

376
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,880
and so or they weren't able to respond

377
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,160
stop their response until we eventually

378
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,079
accepted attribution

379
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,360
a little bit later so um

380
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,160
you could imagine though that that had

381
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,079
some consequences as well of

382
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,880
you know causing some later confusion

383
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,359
about what the attribution process was

384
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,240
so um whether or not that was a good

385
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,759
decision or not

386
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,839
i'm not going to say yes or no now

387
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,240
instead i'd rather continue on with the

388
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,199
talk

389
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,199
and we can um

390
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,360
we can talk about how to how to make

391
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,920
decisions about specific disclosures

392
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,120
even

393
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,120
ones that might seem risky

394
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,720
all right how do i get back to screen

395
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,839
share

396
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,839
is it back for everyone

397
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,399
yeah okay cool

398
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,199
okay um so i'm going to go through a

399
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,839
couple specific instances

400
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,839
of

401
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,800
a few different types of things that we

402
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,880
can make a decision

403
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,479
about disclosing like to disclose or not

404
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,399
disclose decisions

405
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,920
and these are not all of the things that

406
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,240
we as red teamers can make these

407
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,199
decisions about it's just three examples

408
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,880
and um we can talk about them and then

409
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,319
talk about how to make these decisions

410
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,120
more broadly

411
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
so the first is vulnerabilities there's

412
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,839
already a very large

413
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,040
volume of uh work about evaluating the

414
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,839
specific risk of

415
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,839
any individual vulnerability and

416
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,439
i'm not going to try to summarize that

417
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,280
work here instead i'll just say why

418
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,959
it's generally thought as relatively

419
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,399
complicated is because it's very

420
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,280
situational

421
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,000
um you know where vulnerability is what

422
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,559
it is

423
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,359
when why how all that stuff matters and

424
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,079
so

425
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,159
it's situational and when evaluating if

426
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,760
your red team needs to do an immediate

427
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,919
disclosure when they've found a

428
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,520
vulnerability or if you could hold on to

429
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,799
that vulnerability for a while

430
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,639
say for a week or say for three months

431
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,160
maybe maybe maybe longer than three

432
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,280
months uh well it depends on the

433
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,919
situation

434
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,039
uh but what isn't situational is that a

435
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,960
red team is gener

436
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,720
red teaming is generally not an

437
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,440
efficient way to discover

438
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,000
vulnerabilities in terms of cost

439
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,679
and time i hope that you personally

440
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,320
aren't doing red teaming just to

441
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,520
discover

442
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,280
a list of vulnerabilities so if you are

443
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,400
going to disclose a vulnerability

444
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,120
you should ask yourself but will this

445
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,480
disclosure

446
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,959
interrupt whatever it was our red team

447
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,640
was trying to do here

448
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,400
so if we go back to that definition for

449
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,000
upsec

450
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,880
and remember that second paragraph of it

451
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,799
about critical information

452
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,200
what critical information might be

453
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,360
surrendered by this disclosure

454
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,120
uh might you be disclosing like second

455
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,959
order critical information if you tell

456
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,879
defenders about your vulnerability

457
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,840
are you disclosing where it is you're

458
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,400
operating what your target is

459
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,959
what your c2 infrastructure is what ttps

460
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,960
you're using

461
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:41,520
red teaming isn't here to look for

462
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,918
a vulnerability and so you know much

463
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,600
like this picture with this iceberg

464
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,799
the biggest risks that we are trying to

465
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,959
find often lie below the surface

466
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,559
finding or exploiting a vulnerability is

467
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,360
what lets red team

468
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,840
underneath that water so where is the

469
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,280
red team in this photo

470
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,559
i like to think that you can't see them

471
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,360
because they're in a submarine

472
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,440
inspecting the iceberg from below

473
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,280
so to continue testing you might want to

474
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,039
make a decision to disclose a voter or

475
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,720
to not disclose a vulnerability or to

476
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,799
delay that disclosure

477
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,720
and you should consider how much risk

478
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,520
are you really adding if you delay it

479
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,039
for

480
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:24,400
a day or a week or a month

481
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:26,400
or more

482
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,600
the second example that i wanted to talk

483
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,200
about was

484
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,320
ttps or techniques technologies and

485
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,080
procedures

486
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,840
a lot of people use that phrase wrong so

487
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,799
that means i'm probably using

488
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,799
the phrase ttp wrong as well feel free

489
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,160
to yell at me on twitter

490
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:46,799
or in chat but this isn't a talk about

491
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
minor attack usually when somebody asks

492
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,320
me

493
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,799
for a ttp what they're asking for is the

494
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,840
specific command syntax that is being

495
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,120
run

496
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,360
with something now this syntax is

497
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,520
actually very valuable for defenders

498
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,520
blue can use it to write detections and

499
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,200
those detections could stop a real bad

500
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,960
actor if the real bad actor was using

501
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,240
the same technique

502
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,760
of course if blue does that that

503
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,520
technique won't work for

504
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:18,559
red teaming anymore but that's good

505
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,400
right i am

506
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,840
i should have actually made put the

507
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,039
picture

508
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,120
on um i should have put that that meme

509
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,640
that's a pirate saying like well yes but

510
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,639
actually no

511
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,080
because i kind of think that that's the

512
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,919
answer

513
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:38,720
as an organization obviously um

514
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,400
we we do want to create better

515
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,200
detections but what we don't want is we

516
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,799
want to avoid

517
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,400
end up ending up with a blue team that

518
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,240
is tailored to stopping its red team

519
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,919
at the expense of being able to stop

520
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,799
real threat actors

521
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,240
in my experience our blue team is very

522
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,320
smart they don't need to be

523
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,280
told uh the specific ttp that we're

524
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,280
using

525
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,520
if they know the technology or the

526
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,039
technique or the general area in which

527
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,158
we're operating

528
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:11,520
they can usually figure it out and

529
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,320
over time um come up with defenses that

530
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,799
that

531
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,360
stop not just our specific ttp but the

532
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,400
whole

533
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,559
you know range of techniques

534
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,159
by not disclosing the full syntax of a

535
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,960
procedure called a blue

536
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,320
and continuing to use that until it

537
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,080
works

538
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,360
red team can be an effective test of

539
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,840
effectiveness of

540
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,918
defenses without allowing for those

541
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,918
tailored anti-red team only alerts

542
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,960
ttps are pretty directly correlated with

543
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,240
red team operational capabilities they

544
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,679
take time to

545
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,080
test and develop um which means losing

546
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,240
them

547
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,240
is expensive in terms of creating new

548
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,000
work for your red team

549
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,159
so the example i want to give here is if

550
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,919
this robber in this picture gets foiled

551
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,200
because the homeowner installs a crowbar

552
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,440
proof door

553
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,200
that's great but if the robber gets

554
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,200
foiled because the homeowner installs a

555
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,159
blue crowbar proof door

556
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,640
the house isn't really safe from forced

557
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,799
entry

558
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,360
you foiled this guy let's say he's the

559
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,840
red team or doing a test

560
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,158
but you haven't actually really

561
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,720
increased the security of the house

562
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,480
so before making disclosure decisions

563
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,480
about ttps

564
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,760
you should consider by disclosing this

565
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
ttp

566
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,120
will we interrupt whatever it is our red

567
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,840
team is trying to do

568
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,678
and furthermore you can consider do we

569
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,439
need to disclose this ttp

570
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:40,080
to help whatever our blue team is trying

571
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,400
to do

572
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,158
okay the last of the three examples i'm

573
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,760
going to give is about disclosing

574
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:51,039
methods and locations of access

575
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,799
sometimes red teaming feels like it's 90

576
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,640
gaining access and then once you have

577
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,600
access the rest is just a little 10

578
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,159
on the end um gaining initial access to

579
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,120
a network

580
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,640
can be expensive in terms of time and

581
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,479
research development

582
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,320
and there can be a lot of moving parts

583
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,320
um setting up c2 infrastructure

584
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,039
categorizing domains

585
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,918
testing a fish packaging an implant

586
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,879
making sure

587
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,320
all of your stuff talks to each other uh

588
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,840
for your c2

589
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,760
it's time consuming it has a lot of

590
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,959
moving parts and disclosing even small

591
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,679
details

592
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,559
about how a red team did a breach can

593
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,880
mean that the whole

594
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:30,080
access gets routed and now you have to

595
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,600
do a lot of rework to regain that access

596
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,039
for another engagement it's important to

597
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,399
pause and ask that question what are we

598
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,039
trying to assess here

599
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,039
what's the goal

600
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,678
generally in my experience access

601
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,479
falls into one of two buckets it either

602
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,480
falls into

603
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,039
a systemic issue or a specific issue

604
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,000
uh bucket so i want to give an example

605
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,200
of comparing

606
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,520
a access via a web app exploitation

607
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,200
via access via phishing to a company

608
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,799
network

609
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,360
so um while

610
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,240
with webex web exploitation while the

611
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,120
root cause of

612
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,880
why a web vulnerability might have been

613
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,719
pushed to a production environment could

614
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,799
be a systemic issue

615
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,799
fixing it fixing that problem is a

616
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,879
fairly straightforward

617
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,240
operation for blue they tell the

618
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,679
developers to

619
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,279
patch the application retest it and

620
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,799
then you can move on with your lives

621
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,039
knowing that that method

622
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:36,158
of access has now been resolved

623
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,960
fishing um on the other hand

624
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,559
is more complicated and it often relies

625
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,480
on a layered defense

626
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,760
where if um you don't detect the fish

627
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,240
and

628
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,760
an attacker is able to gain access via a

629
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,640
fish it's a systemic issue

630
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,559
including multiple failures such as the

631
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,360
email not getting flagged

632
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,840
employees not reporting an email

633
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,240
inability to detect

634
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:05,360
staging no hips alerts nothing from edr

635
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,760
et cetera in the first case

636
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,559
with the web exploitation if your

637
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,360
organization

638
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,559
fixes that web application vuln the app

639
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,199
can't be rehacked

640
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,200
using the same volume i hope

641
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,600
but considering how blue teams respond

642
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,879
to fishing after they clean up

643
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,120
the hosts block the c2 infrastructure

644
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,880
new hosts can often be fished again

645
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,479
using similar methods

646
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,000
so cleaning up the fish resolves the

647
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,159
immediate problem

648
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,360
but it doesn't make the company more

649
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,919
secure against

650
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,918
future attacks necessarily

651
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,918
so i'll ask those who are thinking about

652
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,120
disclosing and what to disclose about

653
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:52,240
their methods and locations of access um

654
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,959
to ask the question will disclosing

655
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,799
this information help prevent a similar

656
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,120
breach in the future

657
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,879
and to also consider will keeping the

658
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,918
method and location of access secret

659
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,080
from blue

660
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,799
and asking them to work to discover it

661
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,559
be a valuable exercise

662
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:13,120
this is a clear trade-off um between

663
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,000
time spent regaining access and time

664
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,479
spent doing

665
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,120
operational goals but at the end of the

666
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,760
day

667
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,719
red is part of a defensive mission and

668
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,840
is trying to act

669
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,360
like a good sparring partner for blue's

670
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,240
benefit um

671
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,000
so with this picture i'll say what would

672
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,880
be a more valuable experience

673
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,760
for this kid either catching a fish for

674
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,760
him

675
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,960
or giving him a real fishing rod instead

676
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,640
of a stick

677
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,279
and telling him that that bobber needs

678
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,279
to be in the water

679
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,719
so you might have noticed uh in each of

680
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,240
my

681
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,640
last three sections i asked something

682
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,240
around the lines of consider how this is

683
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,760
helping your goal

684
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,400
and that's really the main takeaway of

685
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,640
my talk opsec should empower your red

686
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,960
team strategy

687
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,080
whatever it is you're trying to get done

688
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,080
by red teaming

689
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,279
your opsec decisions should extend from

690
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,879
that strategy

691
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,799
which means that there isn't one right

692
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,679
answer about how to do opsec

693
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,158
as a red team and so i do want to pause

694
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,080
again

695
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,600
um the last poll took a bit of time so

696
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,158
maybe people could just drop

697
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,840
a um like a like a yes in chat

698
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,760
for this one that would be a faster way

699
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,840
to do it um

700
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,840
but i want to ask how many red teamers

701
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:35,600
no actually let's do let's do a um

702
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,720
oh changing status might be a good idea

703
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:42,080
status yeah let's do that so

704
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,520
um change your status to um to red

705
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,840
if you can um or i guess you can't type

706
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,840
in a string you just

707
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
click

708
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,600
maybe change your status to agree

709
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,439
if you can name

710
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,399
your strategy your red team strategy in

711
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,360
a sentence or two

712
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,360
if you work on a red team

713
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,720
can you could you state your red team

714
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,189
[Music]

715
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,199
strategy

716
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:31,840
i'm trying to look where i can see

717
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:31,840
people's statuses

718
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,840
next to the name

719
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,600
oh yeah okay this little thumbs up

720
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,240
all right so it looks like uh just a

721
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,439
handful of people could name

722
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,360
their their strategies um

723
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,039
somebody said that somebody put a thumbs

724
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,279
down that they can't that that's

725
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,480
a good observation uh i'd like everyone

726
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,440
if you could reset your

727
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,279
your status and i want to ask a question

728
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,799
that's probably going to get even less

729
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,520
affirmatives which is um how many blue

730
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,559
teams

731
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:27,840
blue team members could succinctly state

732
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:27,840
their red team strategy

733
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:44,960
one person says no that's it so far

734
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,960
all right not many um

735
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:52,080
yeah so it's it's a good question

736
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,440
i hope and i asked it for a reason to

737
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,879
illustrate that you know

738
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,799
um that is something that we should

739
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,919
think about

740
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,840
i'm not surprised by the the lack of

741
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,640
of people knowing their own or other

742
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,639
team strategies

743
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,879
so here's my attempt at writing out our

744
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,000
red team strategy

745
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,039
um this isn't an official statement from

746
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,679
the company these

747
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,200
are my own words um but i think that our

748
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,559
strategy is to prepare

749
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,120
our company for an inevitable breach by

750
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,240
realistically simulating an apt to spar

751
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,479
with blue

752
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,600
and demonstrating what where and how the

753
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:37,840
company is

754
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:37,840
most vulnerable to catastrophic damage

755
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,440
so this this slide the statement on this

756
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,039
slide is

757
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,600
is very important to me um

758
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,120
keeping more details from blue team

759
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,080
doesn't mean that you're not

760
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,199
collaborating with them i don't want

761
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,320
this to be viewed

762
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,840
as a purple team to purple team or to

763
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,039
not purple team kind of

764
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,918
kind of talk instead

765
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,399
what i think that we should do is think

766
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,440
about

767
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,760
how our various strategies

768
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,720
of individual teams red team and blue

769
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,600
team can work together in concert

770
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,600
if you are

771
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,120
working together on a a shared plan

772
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,120
that you think is going to increase your

773
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,678
company's security posture

774
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,840
um you don't need to be necessarily

775
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,840
sharing every detail to be being

776
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
collaborative

777
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,000
okay so let's get back to the the opsec

778
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,440
definition

779
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,519
remembering that the army says that

780
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,840
opsec is a process

781
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,600
so this on the screen is the process

782
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,279
outlined in the army's model

783
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,199
i don't think that ready teams need to

784
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,120
do all these individual steps

785
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,240
but in general i think we should

786
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,918
remember that

787
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,360
definition for critical information

788
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,919
which i've quoted at the bottom of the

789
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,158
slide the compromise of this information

790
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,679
could prevent or seriously degrade

791
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,840
mission success

792
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:12,840
so if we look at step e in this process

793
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,039
the optic measure is basically keep that

794
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,959
secret

795
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,519
and we shouldn't be making that decision

796
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,320
just once instead we should be actively

797
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,039
considering

798
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,519
what information uh what the information

799
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,000
is

800
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,279
and if we tell it will it degrade our

801
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,720
ability to deliver

802
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,679
on our red team strategy now to be very

803
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,360
clear here

804
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,200
red teams should not care if

805
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,320
disclosing information degrades their

806
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,519
ability to hack the company

807
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,918
only if it degrades the strategy

808
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,919
which should be related to an ability to

809
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,480
contribute to the security posture of

810
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,480
the company

811
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,519
okay so um how do you make that

812
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,760
calculation

813
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,760
of how to do these disclosures um

814
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,840
there's a uh section of of of wisdom

815
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,360
from

816
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,000
a martial arts book that i uh have read

817
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,799
um the book of five rings that i always

818
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,240
remember

819
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,399
so the author for those who aren't

820
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,880
familiar with the book of five rings

821
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,918
um was this basically super deadly

822
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,480
samurai

823
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,159
right and it's a book about mastery uh

824
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,679
generally and more specifically

825
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,600
he's talking about like his

826
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,679
swordsmanship um

827
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,719
and he says i can't quote this so i'm

828
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,519
gonna just

829
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,799
paraphrase it um he says generally that

830
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,880
every movement you take

831
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,120
your intention should be to cut the

832
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,559
enemy and

833
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,840
that stuck with me and i thought that

834
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,639
was a profound piece of advice because

835
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,320
as somebody who is not somebody who ever

836
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:53,120
uses a sword

837
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,320
because i am a modern human being um

838
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,639
that piece of advice is very

839
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,559
transferable it's basically

840
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,000
advising whatever you're doing every

841
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:05,120
move you make every action you take

842
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,120
should be helping achieve your goal

843
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,960
so if this uh talk does inspire you to

844
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,598
do one thing and one thing only i

845
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,040
i would hope that it would be um to go

846
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,399
and figure out what your team's

847
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,399
strategy is um i hope it inspires you to

848
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,040
also make better opsec decisions but it

849
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,359
all starts

850
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,359
by knowing what your team strategy is

851
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,918
so before i kind of get into the closing

852
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,760
portion of my presentation

853
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,279
i do want to reiterate the importance of

854
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,359
trust

855
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,399
secrets and um secrets in general in

856
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,799
organizations are

857
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,078
are dangerous because of the human

858
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,679
factor

859
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,879
there is a innate emotional response to

860
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,560
secrecy and if you don't handle and

861
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,399
manage

862
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,000
that response it could have an impact on

863
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,359
your reputation

864
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,280
i generally believe that your

865
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,759
professional reputation is your most

866
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,400
valuable asset it is the thing that lets

867
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,240
you

868
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,880
get things done at work um

869
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,680
and so i kind of want to leave you with

870
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,119
this advice

871
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,879
on on the slide about um

872
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,040
or actually on the next slide about how

873
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,280
to how to best

874
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:24,800
manage that which is communication

875
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,760
if you're transparent and explain to

876
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,480
your peers

877
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,200
why you are keeping secrets if your

878
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,599
strategy is coherent and your peers can

879
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,160
see how your opsec decisions are drawn

880
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,800
from your strategy you will be able to

881
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,920
keep those

882
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,560
secrets without impacting trust but if

883
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,560
your

884
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,000
decisions about what to keep secret

885
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,078
don't have an explanation for

886
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,760
them or maybe maybe you have an

887
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,160
explanation for them but you haven't

888
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,359
communicated it broadly

889
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,920
you're opening a window for mistrust and

890
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,680
so

891
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,680
i think that we should take a step back

892
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,399
as red teamers generally

893
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,919
consider other people's feelings

894
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,280
remember we need to cultivate that

895
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,400
positive reputation

896
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:10,160
and then communicate about

897
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,160
our strategy and about opsec

898
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,359
so um lastly i'm gonna leave you all

899
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,520
with some homework

900
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,240
so um these are some things that you can

901
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,680
do when you

902
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,640
when you get back to get back to work um

903
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,480
you should start by talking to your red

904
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,160
team about opsec

905
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,760
and then you can follow up by talking to

906
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,759
your blue team about opsec

907
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,160
you should write things down why not

908
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,880
make a

909
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,399
list of your opsec decisions or a table

910
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,640
that could potentially

911
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,720
outline your critical information and

912
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,359
what you do to control it what is kept

913
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,359
secret when

914
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,879
here's another example of what written

915
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,879
out guidelines could look like

916
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,320
uh by documenting your guide or your

917
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,480
guidelines in a way like this

918
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,760
you could help increase transparency and

919
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,839
understanding

920
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,000
you could potentially help your team

921
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,920
make better decisions and get different

922
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,640
members of your own red team on the same

923
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,640
page

924
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,759
but whatever you do around documentation

925
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,598
i would ask that

926
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,839
you remember to make it a living

927
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,880
document because remember

928
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,880
opsec is a process

929
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,200
so that's my talk i hope you all enjoyed

930
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,359
it

931
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,359
and i want to thank everyone for for

932
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,320
listening
