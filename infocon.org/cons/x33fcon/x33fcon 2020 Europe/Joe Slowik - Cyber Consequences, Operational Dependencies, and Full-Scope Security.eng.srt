1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,920
well hello everyone uh

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,079
good afternoon perhaps good evening for

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,640
some uh good morning for me still

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,560
a pleasure though to be here for virtual

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,560
zifecon uh not as nice as being in

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,720
gadina but we will take what we can get

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,840
given current circumstances

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,160
so for to close out the day for

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,880
zivkan we'll talk about something that

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,640
i've been

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,079
thinking about for almost exactly a year

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,120
now on

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,800
cyber consequences in the perspective of

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,959
operational dependencies and how this

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,000
applies to security

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,520
beyond the scope that we typically apply

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,640
of just networks or just focusing on

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,600
the i.t assets within an organization so

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,399
first who am i

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,079
uh my name is joseph sloick swovik if

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,879
you actually pronounce it properly in

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,600
polish as opposed to how uh

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,559
pronounce it in the united states but uh

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,960
currently i

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,720
work for a company called drakos where i

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,199
do threat intelligence work

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,280
with an emphasis on industrial control

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,000
systems and in fact many of the examples

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
that we'll talk about

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
today are industrial in nature which

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,960
will be

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,080
fairly uh obvious why that is when you

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,600
start talking about

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,439
chains of consequences and how that

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,320
plays out in terms of

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:31,039
physical responses and um

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,919
also prior to that i led the incident

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,400
response team

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,960
at los alamos national laboratory and

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,840
was a

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,039
officer in the us navy prior to that but

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,159
enough about me

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,560
uh really this talk came about with

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,439
an event that happened exactly a year

45
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,840
ago today

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,960
uh maybe the 13th of september depending

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,560
on time zones but

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,399
at least it was reported in the u.s

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,520
press on the 14th of september

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,880
last year in 2019 of a

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,119
drone and missile strike on a

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,158
oil and gas facility or several oil and

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,000
gas facilities

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:09,200
in saudi arabia including a massive

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,440
oil processing facility at a pla

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,560
in a location called upkick which is

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,480
responsible for

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,599
hydro desulfurization of sour crude oil

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,079
essentially the app cake facility allows

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,440
for

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,480
the further refinement of produced

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,280
crude oil so that it is acceptable to

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,238
markets for importation now if you look

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,519
at the

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,319
overall strategic picture within saudi

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,560
arabia

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,280
the upcake facility has been sort of the

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,840
nasty little secret of the saudi

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,319
uh oil industry for quite some time in

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,680
that

71
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,640
the majority of saudi oil exportation

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,000
is dependent upon the refinement at ab

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,279
cake in order for oil to

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,040
be suitable for exportation basically if

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,480
that facility doesn't exist or if that

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,920
facility is damaged

77
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,159
such as through a drone or missile

78
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,319
strike um

79
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,239
the entire industry grinds to a halt and

80
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,399
in fact that's kind of what happened for

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,800
several weeks if not several months as

82
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,040
that facility was being repaired that

83
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,080
the saudis needed or at least saudi

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,720
aramco had to dip

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,440
into reserves in order to meet previous

86
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,239
demand

87
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,319
so that really shows that there's a sort

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,640
of a critical dependency here that you

89
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,879
know

90
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,000
in order to impact a much bigger process

91
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,399
the entire

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,680
oil and gas industry in saudi arabia

93
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,840
really you can target

94
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,080
only one specific facility and even then

95
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,319
only very specific aspects of that

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,400
facility in order to have outsized

97
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,359
results now you may be asking yourself

98
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,280
right now

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
wait a minute this is a cyber conference

100
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,959
this is red versus blue we should be

101
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,400
talking about information security

102
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,799
where the hell is the cyber the cyber is

103
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,000
there

104
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,920
because concurrently with this event

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,280
roughly concurrently you know certainly

106
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,079
from

107
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,120
late 2018 through multiple events in

108
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,360
2019

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,560
including a few that took place shortly

110
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,599
after the

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,480
physical attack on the app cake facility

112
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,839
there there had been multiple rounds of

113
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,040
destructive

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,040
disruptive malware attacks or incidents

115
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,439
on the oil and gas sector in saudi

116
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,079
arabia as well as in other areas of the

117
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,399
gulf

118
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,280
so really what we're seeing or how we

119
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:25,440
can categorize the upcake strike is

120
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:28,719
really is one part of a broader set of

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,880
efforts or designs to try and disrupt

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,600
one of the main economic engines of this

123
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,960
region and as efforts tied to iranian

124
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,479
strategic interests

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,599
so what we're seeing is not just a

126
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,479
example of what cyber can do but really

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
looking in to a greater degree or to a

128
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,919
more in-depth degree

129
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,440
of adversaries have goals and those

130
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,479
goals don't necessarily need to be met

131
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,479
by cyber

132
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,880
but the way in which modern systems and

133
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,560
complex nature of things like the saudi

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,040
oil and gas industry operate meaning

135
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,360
that

136
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,039
we can start looking at really specific

137
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,120
ways of targeting these

138
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:09,919
uh establishments or these organizations

139
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,000
so that relatively small or focused

140
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,080
impacts can have outsized influence

141
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,199
resulting in much broader dislocation

142
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,080
than just the immediate

143
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,280
impact of whatever is initially targeted

144
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,159
and

145
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,000
looking at some of the wiper events we

146
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,240
haven't quite gotten there yet

147
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,240
but in light of things like the abk

148
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,960
strike it seems that adversaries are

149
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,880
starting to get

150
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,320
smarter in terms of what they're

151
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,039
targeting and

152
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,840
what certain weaknesses or achilles

153
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,159
heels

154
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,840
may exist within these entities so the

155
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,240
takeaway is that attackers

156
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,359
ultimately care about causing disruption

157
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,639
of some sort

158
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,440
and complex systems like a

159
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,560
nationwide oil and gas industry largely

160
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,600
operated by a single organization

161
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,880
really yield specific pain points that

162
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,960
could allow for

163
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,800
outsized impact if those weak points are

164
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,198
first identified and then

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,240
exploited or disrupted in some way which

166
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,280
gets us back to

167
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,039
the cybers so our agenda today after

168
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,679
this lengthy introduction

169
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,280
is we'll talk about process and

170
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,440
operational dependencies and how this

171
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,599
loops back into information systems

172
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,759
and then look at uh in very brief

173
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,280
fashion some targeted disruptive attacks

174
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,199
that focus on this

175
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,198
uh concept of dependencies or

176
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,960
critical path dependencies for how

177
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,400
things are executed and what sort of

178
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,400
implications and risks

179
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,000
those dependencies have and then we'll

180
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,840
conclude by talking about

181
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,360
what do you what do we do about this how

182
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,318
do we defend against this and

183
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,280
how can we embrace or take into

184
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,000
consideration

185
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,520
concepts like offensive security in

186
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,160
trying to

187
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,039
cover or to mitigate against these type

188
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,960
of risks

189
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,639
and finally close with some future

190
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,919
expectations for what we might

191
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,720
expect within this space so first

192
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,520
process complexity this is a screenshot

193
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,160
from

194
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,599
modeling software produced by rockwell

195
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,039
it's called arena at least i think it's

196
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,440
still produced by rockwell

197
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,280
but uh you know this is just a very

198
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,080
simple example of how to model

199
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,638
a complex in this case it's a shipping

200
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,280
uh

201
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,160
process and as we can see here and this

202
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,159
is no different than

203
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,919
looking at things like program uml or um

204
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,880
you know processed program design

205
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:28,080
language of how we can start laying out

206
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,039
um operations from very

207
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,159
very start or inputs into a process all

208
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,318
the way to its end

209
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,919
and seeing the different decision gates

210
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,000
or the different requirements

211
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,840
as uh you know whether you're talking

212
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,880
about manufacturing as widgets move

213
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,359
along the line

214
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,360
of the different necessary stages that

215
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,160
the widget needs to go through until it

216
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,639
is

217
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,479
finalized or production is complete well

218
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,280
the thing is is that process complexity

219
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,199
means that

220
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,559
we have an ever greater number of

221
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,840
potential touch points

222
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,240
where that process can be disrupted that

223
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,520
if

224
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,120
a certain process node is removed or

225
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,198
degraded in some way

226
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,160
the entire process as a whole can grind

227
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,000
to a halt

228
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,440
which gets us into the concept of

229
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,360
process dependencies

230
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,800
so typically we look at these in terms

231
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,080
of critical path nodes

232
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,680
uh as they come in terms of timing

233
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,039
that uh the

234
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,759
sort of deltas or the differences

235
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,759
between

236
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,599
the earliest and latest start and finish

237
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,639
times for something and how that gets

238
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,880
uh sorted out to identify

239
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,880
what are the stages that will be the

240
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,519
determining items for how long a process

241
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,279
will take

242
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,719
well the same sort of concept applies

243
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,159
when we start looking again going back

244
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,880
to process complexity

245
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,800
that if we have something like a uh

246
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,120
hydro diesel fertilization facility that

247
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,439
is required for oil and gas production

248
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,200
that that becomes a critical path node

249
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,800
for the entire process to function

250
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,240
so while there may be certain things

251
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,479
that yes if this is

252
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,000
delayed or degraded in some way we can

253
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,160
work around that in some way

254
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,120
or the amount of time required to bring

255
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,719
that specific

256
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,480
piece of the process back up and running

257
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,839
again is something that we can absorb

258
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,360
because we're waiting on

259
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,320
other things to get taken care of in the

260
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,760
meantime

261
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,839
there are other items that we simply

262
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,160
can't do without that

263
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,440
form a critical path node for the

264
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,319
overall process that if those are

265
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,440
disrupted

266
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,519
then the entire process is

267
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,160
impacted in some fashion and we see this

268
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,360
building up as we get into ever more

269
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,000
complex and ever

270
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,839
more uh distributed sort of processes

271
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,760
that have multiple dependencies

272
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,080
these can be dependencies on external

273
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,279
suppliers they can be dependencies on

274
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,040
external infrastructure

275
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,800
think the cloud which we'll get into in

276
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,680
a second and

277
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,359
other items that can allow for

278
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,279
operational disruption

279
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,640
to be simplified i mean it's kind of

280
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,519
funny that we talk about greater

281
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,040
complexity

282
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,279
on the one hand leading to a

283
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,360
simplification of cyber attacks

284
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,880
or even just attacks in general on the

285
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,440
other um

286
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,079
but the ultimate takeaway from this is

287
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,399
that

288
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,439
in order to adequately defend or build

289
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,680
in resiliency

290
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,560
to these sorts of networks whether we're

291
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,560
talking about

292
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,319
industrial processes or even things like

293
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,399
elections or the financial system

294
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,360
we need to understand the nature of the

295
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,279
operation

296
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,600
and what those critical path nodes are

297
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,160
or what those

298
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,959
most uh important or most significant

299
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,680
aspects

300
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,239
of the overall process might be that can

301
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,719
lead to

302
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,079
outsized impacts should an attacker hold

303
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,480
that at risk

304
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,399
and we see this in modern operations

305
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,440
through things like

306
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,399
complex supply chains as well as an

307
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,680
emphasis

308
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,360
from a business perspective of things

309
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,439
like just-in-time production

310
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,600
and inventory minimization the so-called

311
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,160
toyota production system or

312
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,200
uh method of thinking that many

313
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,880
organizations

314
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,160
whether you're talking logistics like in

315
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,279
amazon or manufacturing like a toyota or

316
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,240
most other

317
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,720
automotive manufacturers um of not

318
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,399
having

319
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,160
lots of spare parts on hand because it

320
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,440
costs money and we want to save money

321
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,120
and make things as most

322
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,880
most efficient as possible well the

323
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,160
problem is in getting after these

324
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,320
efficiencies or

325
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,399
trying to diversify supply chains is

326
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,320
that it starts extending out

327
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:21,680
um the potentials for disrupting

328
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,920
uh the process itself and introducing

329
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,959
the capability or enhancing the

330
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,680
capability

331
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,119
of an attacker to hold that at risk and

332
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,239
we see this extending into

333
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,600
digitalization

334
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,440
whether you're talking about something

335
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,760
within industrial controls like the

336
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,839
so-called fourth industrial revolution

337
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,880
where we start integrating things like

338
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,079
cloud computing

339
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,480
and increased adoption of information

340
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,519
systems and physical environments such

341
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,040
that uh

342
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,880
items that previously would have been

343
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,040
only

344
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,800
vulnerable or only accessible through

345
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,880
physical means or

346
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,120
some other fashion are now network

347
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,839
reachable allowing for attackers to

348
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,920
potentially influence processes or touch

349
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,760
or manipulate processes that wouldn't

350
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,639
have been accessible previously

351
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,880
exposing the uh vulnerable or the

352
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,440
critical systems to potential attack

353
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,720
and we see this even uh getting away

354
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,360
from very industrial

355
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,399
examples into just general information

356
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,320
processing where

357
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,240
we talk about organizations minimizing

358
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,720
risks through adoption of the cloud

359
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,720
or adoption of managed service providers

360
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,000
but as we've seen when things like a

361
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,959
cloud flare goes down

362
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,399
or there's a massive power outage or

363
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,119
network uh

364
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,560
whether physical or logical uh network

365
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,240
routing incident that might impact the

366
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,800
northern virginia region in the united

367
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,519
states

368
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,680
which happens to be where the ec2

369
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,680
instance for aws east is located

370
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,199
that that has magnified effects that

371
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,040
then all those organizations that were

372
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,279
dependent upon

373
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,839
those resources are now impacted because

374
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,079
they had relied upon that being there no

375
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,519
matter what and now are

376
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,760
impacted through the loss of that

377
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,320
supposed uh resiliency that had been

378
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,560
built out through a third party

379
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,160
okay so that's enough about talking lots

380
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,518
of business examples and

381
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,040
other sorts of things maybe it's a

382
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,360
little boring for those who are just

383
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,040
closing up the day of multiple talks

384
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,480
how does this actually apply to attacks

385
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,360
and i always like throwing the norse map

386
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,639
out here because

387
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,320
we can all point and laugh at this

388
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,440
because they're no longer around to

389
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,360
defend themselves

390
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,480
but anyway uh you know have we actually

391
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800
seen this in practice

392
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,560
and the answer is yes and not just in

393
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,199
talking about someone launching missiles

394
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,920
at an oil and gas processing facility

395
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,279
we've seen this going back quite far and

396
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,479
to try to limit the discussion we're

397
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,880
only going to talk about

398
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,519
about five or six examples today but the

399
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,800
first one

400
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,360
goes back six years uh in ukraine

401
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,040
in 2014 during the country's

402
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,600
presidential elections

403
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,719
there were a series of network

404
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,440
intrusions

405
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,360
uh linked to cyberberkut which is

406
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,639
assessed by many to be linked to russian

407
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,240
strategic interests

408
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,199
uh you can actually read about that in

409
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,959
depth in mentioned earlier

410
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,599
with tom ridd's book that it comes up in

411
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,800
there

412
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,320
but uh anyway uh getting back to the

413
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,519
ukraine example what was interesting

414
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,760
about this is that

415
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,199
the defenders in question did a good job

416
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,639
in remediating

417
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,240
and recovering from this attack that

418
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,240
it looked like the attackers were trying

419
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,680
to take down various

420
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,440
election infrastructure

421
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,479
and inhibit the ability of the ukrainian

422
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,600
state to announce results and

423
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,560
to uh provide feedback in the aftermath

424
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,240
of the election

425
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,239
well the thing is though is that there

426
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,320
was a critical dependency that

427
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,360
the immediate defenders didn't have

428
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,040
control over

429
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,399
which provided for a very interesting

430
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,959
attack pattern and while this didn't

431
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,000
exactly

432
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,000
work as intended because the defenders

433
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,519
in ukraine did a good job in responding

434
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,839
to the initial attacks

435
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,360
what this event highlighted was a really

436
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,639
interesting way in which

437
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,519
the media served as

438
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,199
a critical external dependency for the

439
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,560
ukrainian election results

440
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,479
such that the way the attack was

441
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,119
designed was to try to interrupt the

442
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,680
ability

443
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,800
of the ukrainian government to broadcast

444
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,399
official results

445
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,639
and then to throw up fake results that

446
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,120
could then be uh

447
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,839
amplified retweeted however you want to

448
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,639
phrase it

449
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,240
um by malicious authorities in this case

450
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,360
by russian state media

451
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,120
in order to increase uncertainty

452
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,519
and cause a certain degree of

453
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,880
instability surrounding the entire

454
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,560
electoral process

455
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,160
and the thing is is that as good of a

456
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,119
job as the defenders

457
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,240
did in uh defending the election

458
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,079
authority networks

459
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,519
they didn't have control over this media

460
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,160
aspect and had this attack

461
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,360
been a shade more successful uh the

462
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,880
attackers would have been

463
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,800
or the defenders would have been in a

464
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,000
bind in not being able to

465
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,560
or not having uh the foresight to

466
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,360
extend their response to include things

467
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,199
like oh

468
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,480
you know do we have the ability to try

469
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,199
to control

470
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,920
or manage the narrative for what is

471
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,479
going on

472
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,920
and how results may be broadcast after

473
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,240
the fact and might an attacker take

474
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,319
advantage of this

475
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,000
keeping on the ukrainian theme the very

476
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,720
next year in 2015

477
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,839
we saw the first cyber nexus or the

478
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,560
first publicly known

479
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,600
at least cyber nexus manipulation of the

480
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,920
electric system

481
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,639
with a attack linked to the sand worm

482
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,759
entity

483
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,600
that resulted in the uh disruption

484
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,519
of electric distribution operations

485
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,399
across several sites within

486
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,680
uh ukraine for several hours what was

487
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,839
interesting about this attack though is

488
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,079
that it wasn't just a question of

489
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,759
turning off the lights so to speak but

490
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,120
rather it was

491
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:46,560
a attack that went to pains to target

492
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,279
process recovery looking at the specific

493
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,758
functions

494
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,480
within the electric electricity

495
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,240
management

496
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,600
or the especially in the distribution

497
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,399
level managing on

498
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,600
the distribution yards of what would the

499
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,079
operators need

500
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,800
to restore operations after opening

501
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,040
breakers

502
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,799
within the affected facilities so really

503
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,199
the electric disruption was just the

504
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,039
first

505
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,839
stage of a multi-stage attack that um

506
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,039
included afterwards uh blocking serial

507
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,438
internet uh

508
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,280
converters that would allow for logical

509
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,199
commands from the control center to go

510
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,119
down to the switching yards

511
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,400
by basically bricking those devices to

512
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,479
provide communication

513
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,439
and then to make things even worse

514
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,520
corrupting the

515
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,559
uninterruptible power supplies within

516
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,600
the

517
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,320
control rooms so that the backup power

518
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,120
when

519
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,678
primary power was lost because of the uh

520
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,399
electric

521
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,919
disruption uh the power was also lost

522
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,000
and then finally wiping

523
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,840
the operator workstations with kill disc

524
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,280
malware to

525
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,879
produce a loss of view over the

526
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,799
environment in addition to the

527
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,880
loss of power and the inability to send

528
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,440
commands to the physical equipment

529
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,559
so overall uh what the attackers

530
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,120
realized or attempted to achieve in 2015

531
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,960
was not just interrupting the supply of

532
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,840
power but sort of blowing the bridges

533
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,799
behind them

534
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,000
by understanding the processes necessary

535
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,559
in order to

536
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,360
facilitate operational recovery to

537
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,520
prolong

538
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,639
that disruption as long as possible well

539
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,600
in this case the

540
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,760
ukrainians and again the ukraine has

541
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,280
been the victim of so many things and

542
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,039
overall they've done a really good job

543
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,520
in trying to uh

544
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,360
keep pace with these under very very

545
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,840
distressing circumstances not to mention

546
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
having

547
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,360
a portion of their country basically

548
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,559
invaded but

549
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,360
in 2015 the operators were able to

550
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,200
restore

551
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,879
electricity fairly quickly because they

552
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,919
rapidly transitioned into manual

553
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,799
operations

554
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,000
so that they avoided all of the

555
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,120
dislocation produced

556
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,720
by these recovery targeting uh aspects

557
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,159
of the attack

558
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,480
in western europe or if this had

559
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,880
happened in the united states uh or

560
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,240
poland for that matter and parts uh

561
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,160
parts of the electric system that i'm

562
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,200
familiar with that are rapidly

563
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,039
modernizing

564
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,039
this attack would have been far more

565
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,720
disruptive because there's a greater

566
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,640
reliance on having

567
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,080
remote connectivity and remote control

568
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,679
over these facilities whereas the

569
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,760
ukrainians were able to

570
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,440
spin up personnel on site quite quickly

571
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,600
to restore operations

572
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,120
but what's interesting is that in 2016

573
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,799
again in ukraine

574
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,559
we had another power event that

575
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,320
indicated uh at least

576
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,720
after some further analysis that

577
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,600
attackers had taken into consideration

578
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,559
so the initial takeaway from 2016 in

579
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,199
ukraine

580
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,960
was malware that was responsible for

581
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,440
manipulating the electric system

582
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,440
uh in destroyer as named by eset uh

583
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,520
crash override is named by dr rigos

584
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,120
uh this resulted in a slightly smaller

585
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,720
electric disruption with a quicker

586
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,199
recovery time and so at first it seemed

587
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,440
like

588
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,760
this attack might be less severe but

589
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,240
further review indicated actually a much

590
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,240
more significant attack that was looking

591
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,919
at process protection and

592
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:59,280
specifically the criticality of

593
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,360
protective relays as a critical

594
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,240
component in ensuring the safety and

595
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,840
protection

596
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,039
of electrical equipment to try to induce

597
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,080
a

598
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,080
actual destructive attack within the

599
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,720
targeted transmission station because in

600
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,639
this attack it looked like the attackers

601
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,760
anticipated the rush to physical

602
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,760
restoration

603
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,879
because after inducing the transmission

604
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,280
outage the

605
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,760
attackers then basically deployed

606
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,520
somewhat similar techniques

607
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,080
in order to disrupt recovery but in this

608
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,120
case

609
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,439
added on an additional stage this attack

610
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,158
by

611
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,760
executing a denial of service on a

612
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,559
digital protective relay within the

613
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,320
environment

614
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,480
that removed line protection from the

615
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,918
electric system such that

616
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,840
once the if the system had been

617
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,000
reconnected with the

618
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,520
service having taken place then the

619
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,720
system would have been in an unprotected

620
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,320
state on restoration

621
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,720
leading to the possibility of things

622
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,320
like either an over current condition

623
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,159
or the possibility that natural

624
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,879
fluctuations within the overall electric

625
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,039
environment

626
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,159
could propagate beyond the process

627
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,400
protection in place

628
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,080
to cause physical damage to the electric

629
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
equipment electrical equipment at the

630
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,960
transmission station

631
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,559
which would have been a much costly or

632
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,200
much more significant attack

633
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,200
fortunately the attackers screwed a lot

634
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,120
of things up in this attack

635
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,799
there's a paper that i wrote on this if

636
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,639
anyone is interested in diving into this

637
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,400
in some detail it's also included

638
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,880
in the references at the end of this

639
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,360
talk but overall the takeaway from this

640
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,559
is that

641
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,479
the attackers are learning from uh

642
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,840
events over time and getting more

643
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,559
aggressive and

644
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,639
more ambitious in what it is they're

645
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,480
trying to targeting by looking at focal

646
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,360
points within the overall system

647
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,039
and identifying what are those critical

648
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,760
touch points that could allow for

649
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,919
maximization of not just disruption but

650
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,080
in the 2016 ukraine example

651
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,600
uh even potentially physical destruction

652
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,240
as well

653
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,320
moving on to saudi arabia we had the

654
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,360
triton crisis event which was a oil and

655
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,520
gas facility

656
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,520
within saudi arabia so it might sound

657
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,158
very similar to the upcake attack

658
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,879
although

659
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,480
this is more likely linked to russian

660
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,919
state interest than it is iran that's

661
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,280
kind of an open question and

662
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,360
really beside the point for what we're

663
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,080
discussing here but what was interesting

664
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,158
about this

665
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,439
industrial focused attack was this was a

666
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,799
safety specific

667
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,640
uh attack that the attackers realized

668
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,240
that in order to try to disrupt

669
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,039
operations within an oil and gas

670
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,000
facility

671
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,559
they needed to pair an intrusion into

672
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,720
the plant

673
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,760
distributed control system network that

674
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,679
controls the

675
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,039
physical process itself within the oil

676
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,760
and gas facility

677
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,760
with a compromise of the plant's safety

678
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,080
network as well

679
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,679
this led to the triton crisis malware

680
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,240
which enabled

681
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,039
a undetected arbitrary modification of

682
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,120
safety settings

683
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,720
it worked properly the takeaway here is

684
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,039
that the malware didn't work which

685
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,960
resulted in the safety system tripping

686
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,320
so it led to an immediate plant shutdown

687
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,080
instead of putting the plant in an

688
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,840
unsafe state

689
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,399
leading to the potential for causing

690
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,760
physical disruption later on

691
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,679
the main takeaway here though is that

692
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,559
even though the attackers again failed

693
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,320
to try to execute the attack as likely

694
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,440
intended and there's a couple of papers

695
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,799
i have linked

696
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,559
at the end of this presentation that go

697
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,280
into this in further detail

698
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,120
um this also shows that attackers are

699
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,280
understanding the interconnected nature

700
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,639
of certain industrial processes that in

701
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,080
order to have a

702
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,799
cyber focused impact on a oil and gas

703
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,360
environment that it's not sufficient to

704
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,840
just

705
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,360
modify the settings within the

706
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,000
production network because

707
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,280
those changes or any sort of uh

708
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,039
consequences from them

709
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,960
will be caught by things like the plant

710
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,720
safety network or the various

711
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,320
safety instrumented systems that are

712
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,720
deployed as part of

713
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,439
the plant setup so instead you need to

714
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,000
target that

715
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,200
safety network in order to remove that

716
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,279
layer of protection

717
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,320
to allow attacks to propagate beyond

718
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,799
where they would be caught

719
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,840
and potentially mitigated by plant

720
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,520
safety systems

721
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,639
in order to enable a potential

722
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,639
destructive attack

723
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,400
so i've picked on ukraine a lot we've

724
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,320
talked about saudi arabia but these

725
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,200
aren't just events that are limited to

726
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,720
places that may be somewhat similar to

727
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,000
active conflict zones

728
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,000
instead we're actually seeing this in

729
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,320
places like the united states as well

730
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,840
there was an event in 2018 that was

731
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,840
somewhat overlooked

732
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:28,640
where a company

733
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,639
that is responsible for essentially

734
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,879
data analysis and data collection for

735
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,879
pipeline operations

736
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,600
was compromised in such a way that it

737
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,640
impacted the ability of that company to

738
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,600
perform its role

739
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,600
in managing pipeline related data for

740
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,000
managing inventory tracking shipments

741
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,320
billing

742
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,600
etc and the result was is that the

743
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,960
pipeline system while it could

744
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,000
physically operate

745
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,960
because operations were reliant on the

746
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,799
data aggregation and analysis of the

747
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,120
this particular software suite

748
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,200
that operations were significantly

749
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,360
impaired for a period of time

750
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,480
while the organization worked to recover

751
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,360
from that

752
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:13,360
uh incident so the erp software

753
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,799
in question enables pipeline transfer

754
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,039
operations

755
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,960
by tracking resources and billing seems

756
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,879
like fairly mundane things but

757
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,159
if you can't adequately bill for

758
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,679
material that's flowing through your

759
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,039
pipeline network or you can't even track

760
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,919
the amount of material flowing through

761
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,520
the network

762
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,679
it's really hard to operate in an

763
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,000
accurate or sustainable fashion

764
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,360
and by disabling or modifying that erp

765
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,600
which does not appear to have been the

766
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,279
case in this attack but is a possibility

767
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,039
that may have occurred as a result of

768
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,039
this sort of an intrusion

769
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,640
an attacker could significantly reduce

770
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,039
the operational effectiveness and

771
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,720
integrity of the system in question

772
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,640
such that even though the physical

773
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,919
pipeline network would still be

774
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,799
okay you could still pump gas

775
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,799
oil water whatever it is chemicals that

776
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,799
are flowing through the pipeline network

777
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,559
from a sort of logical perspective

778
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,960
removing the erp

779
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,639
functionality results in an inability to

780
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,440
adequately control and monitor that

781
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,039
process

782
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,200
so that you could no longer operate the

783
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,679
pipeline even though the physical

784
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,760
pipeline integrity is still there so

785
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,080
there's one key component which is also

786
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,760
network facing as opposed to uh air

787
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,080
gapped or isolated

788
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,960
happens to be a achilles heel for

789
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,480
potentially

790
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,480
impacting the entire pipeline system

791
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,080
finally last example uh thank you for

792
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,600
bearing with me so far

793
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,760
also in the united states at the end of

794
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,799
2019 we had another incident

795
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,000
impacting pipelines where ransomware

796
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:40,720
by impacting the ict environment

797
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,559
linked to a pipeline operator resulted

798
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,919
in that pipeline having to shut down for

799
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,639
a period of time

800
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,279
because even though again the pipeline

801
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,240
itself

802
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,279
was not impacted directly by this event

803
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,480
whatsoever

804
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:57,279
the ability to gain visibility into

805
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,320
an operational control over the pipeline

806
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:02,400
was inhibited by losing it-based assets

807
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,678
so again we're having a physical impact

808
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,799
the loss of

809
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,080
pipeline operations um in such a way

810
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,840
that then resulted in

811
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,080
further follow-on disruption not just to

812
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,799
the pipeline itself but to all of those

813
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,799
consumers of the

814
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,799
resources move through that pipeline

815
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,399
because kind of like we've talked about

816
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,320
earlier in terms of things like

817
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,879
inventory minimization and an emphasis

818
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,840
on

819
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,120
just-in-time operations most often when

820
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,678
it comes to things like pipeline

821
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,000
networks

822
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,120
you don't necessarily have large

823
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,039
surpluses or

824
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,399
large inventories of whatever is flowing

825
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,520
through that pipeline but instead of

826
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,678
relying on

827
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,879
just in time or continuous operations in

828
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,360
order to continue

829
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,640
uh natural gas electricity general

830
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,639
chemical plant manufa

831
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,799
etc in the case of something

832
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,799
like this event where we could use

833
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,679
ransomware in order to remove i.t

834
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,600
visibility

835
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,799
over a pipeline now to a pipeline

836
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,639
shutdown

837
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:01,279
we can basically disrupt the pipeline

838
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,360
without ever physically impacting

839
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,440
the operation of the pipeline itself

840
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,080
such that

841
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,080
we can undermine the entire system and

842
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,720
then lead to physical process

843
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,520
uh maybe not disruption outright but

844
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,559
certainly

845
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:21,440
uh process interruption that can in

846
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,840
the lack of ability or the inability of

847
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,279
downstream customers to operate anymore

848
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,600
all is the result of something that's

849
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:30,559
purely i.t focused without having any

850
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,639
bit of ics magical understanding or

851
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,799
whatnot whatsoever

852
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,799
okay so lots of examples lots of

853
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,200
possibilities here what does this mean

854
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,240
well for defenders that means that we're

855
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,559
very comfortable

856
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,600
defending or monitoring it networks

857
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,440
we're very comfortable

858
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,439
pen testing these networks or performing

859
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,159
risk calculations for these networks

860
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,000
but the thing is is that network defense

861
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,000
as we typically apply it

862
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,880
is usually blind to or agnostic to

863
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,799
the actual business processes or

864
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,520
organizational principles

865
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,200
for that the network itself exists to

866
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,520
operate

867
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,799
adversaries however are really only

868
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,520
focused at the end of the day

869
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,080
of delivering some sort of effect and

870
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,520
the network

871
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,199
may just a means to an end for the

872
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,840
adversary and rather

873
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,840
their ultimate goal is trying to achieve

874
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,360
some disruption or dislocation

875
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,879
for the underlying organization uh

876
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,559
whatever it is that the organization

877
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,720
does generate value

878
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,320
because we look at the attacker mindset

879
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,080
adversaries have goals

880
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,720
their goal is to make money their goal

881
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,720
is to disrupt ukraine their goal is to

882
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,559
disrupt the united states or poland or

883
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,799
something else along those lines

884
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,158
well the nature of that goal shutting

885
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,320
down the electricity

886
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,320
manipulating the financial system or

887
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,480
whatnot is going to determine

888
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,520
what type of attack cyber attacks just

889
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,640
happen to be

890
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,360
fairly easy

891
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,840
easy to execute remotely fairly cheaply

892
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,600
to

893
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,039
perform instead of throwing bombs at

894
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,439
someone and whatnot

895
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,520
um and so they're just really a means to

896
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,559
achieve whatever it is the attacker

897
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,879
wants out of this entire process by

898
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,600
identifying the routes to the goals

899
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,120
uh or the various touch points to

900
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,039
achieve these goals shutting down the

901
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,520
electricity shutting down a pipeline

902
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,720
manipulating election results attackers

903
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,799
can then start

904
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,720
figuring out okay based upon what i'm

905
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,639
trying to achieve what is the easiest

906
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,600
simplest way of trying to do this

907
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,399
um and achieve some sense of mission

908
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,840
success

909
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,520
because ultimately attackers don't get

910
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,240
judged on how complex or fancy their

911
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
attack is

912
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,080
they really just get judged in whether

913
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,320
or not they achieve what they were

914
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,080
instructed to do that's what gets them

915
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,760
medals or

916
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,360
allows them to pay out from a ransomware

917
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,200
event and whatnot

918
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,479
well looking at this is that network

919
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,000
defense needs to

920
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,000
adopt a mindset where we're not just

921
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,640
focusing on the network as a value

922
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
in itself but rather the network is just

923
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,399
a

924
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,320
means to an end the network allows the

925
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,639
organization to continue

926
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,559
producing value generating value or not

927
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,159
losing value for the organization

928
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,480
so if we really want to start looking at

929
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:10,080
the various dependencies that play out

930
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,320
in terms of how organizations are built

931
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,158
currently as defenders we need to adopt

932
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,519
a mindset that's similar to attackers

933
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,519
where the network is just

934
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:23,200
a very accessible

935
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,640
or easily manipulated touch point that

936
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,720
attackers can use

937
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,200
in order to cause further on value

938
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,519
disruption and by adapting this mindset

939
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,440
of

940
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,440
value defense for the organization we

941
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,519
can gain greater perspective of

942
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,200
what are the important things within our

943
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,600
own networks that we need to defend

944
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,720
and what are the external dependencies

945
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,519
or the

946
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,039
sort of unlooked for uh cascade of

947
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,080
consequences that might exist from

948
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,000
certain attack vet

949
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,199
vectors so that we don't get surprised

950
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,919
by things such as

951
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,320
like we saw in the 2014 case in ukraine

952
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,240
where

953
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,120
we could do our jobs quite well but

954
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,279
because of a forgotten or unlooked for

955
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,199
external dependency such as relying on

956
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,600
the media in order to

957
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,960
broadcast results that attackers can use

958
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,199
that external dependency

959
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,720
as a way to get around our own internal

960
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,000
successes to still achieve or

961
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,080
potentially achieve

962
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,360
their own goals we need to start mapping

963
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,918
through and understanding the

964
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,039
and extending where we can uh either our

965
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,200
preventative defense

966
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,240
or at least building in mitigations and

967
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,960
resiliency

968
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,320
to try and meet and overcome these sorts

969
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,320
of scenarios

970
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,799
so really what we're looking for here is

971
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,559
a type of full scope defense

972
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,080
where first we want to understand the

973
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,320
organization itself

974
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,120
then we want to start mapping defense to

975
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,960
the process

976
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,799
and organizational dependencies within

977
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,720
our environments and build out

978
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,480
detections resilience and recovery

979
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,480
to match the possibilities for

980
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,840
disrupting key sources of value in our

981
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,760
environment

982
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,678
so the very first step in all this and

983
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,840
this might seem trivial but it's

984
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,200
pretty significant is that we need to

985
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,799
identify what it

986
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,640
what is it about the organizations we

987
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,240
work in that generate value

988
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,080
whether we are providing network defense

989
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,760
for a university for

990
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,678
a global manufacturer or for a bank

991
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,679
what is it that allows our organization

992
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,399
to continue to function

993
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,320
this very simply could be monetary how

994
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,879
does the organization make or not lose

995
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
money

996
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,080
and what are the sources of value

997
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,519
generation within the environment

998
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,439
but that extends a little bit further

999
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,440
into sort of functional values

1000
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,039
such as what processes does the

1001
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,399
organization rely on

1002
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,399
in order to generate value

1003
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,399
based on that we can then start mapping

1004
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,360
out what are the sort of critical nodes

1005
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,439
necessary

1006
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,039
in order to ensure that processes remain

1007
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,840
functional this could be something like

1008
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,200
looking at the backbone swift

1009
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,639
software that allows for interbank

1010
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,080
transfers for example that if that

1011
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,679
doesn't exist the entire financial

1012
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,120
system grinds to a halt

1013
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,519
maybe we want to make sure that we build

1014
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,559
in resiliency or some understanding for

1015
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,240
how we ensure that the sort of plumbing

1016
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,440
between organizations does not get

1017
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,039
disrupted so that

1018
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,640
uh we don't get a essentially a

1019
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,360
functional kill on the business through

1020
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,039
something that

1021
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,399
we otherwise were ignoring or not

1022
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,760
bothering to control

1023
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,439
uh and lastly and this is kind of

1024
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,960
interesting as well and somewhat

1025
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,640
difficult to try and defend against but

1026
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,639
very important to keep in mind

1027
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,560
there's also the question of reputation

1028
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,119
or optics

1029
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,159
when it comes to disruptions intrusions

1030
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,399
and other

1031
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,200
activities what type of disruption can

1032
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,359
an organization

1033
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,960
actually withstand can we have something

1034
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,359
like acceptable losses

1035
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,679
or are there certain things that even

1036
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,960
any sort of intrusion any loss of data

1037
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,359
or any disruption whatsoever results in

1038
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,480
too significant of a reputational hit

1039
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,239
that we must avoid

1040
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,918
by at all costs so based on that

1041
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,678
we could look at examples such as um

1042
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,078
when evaluating different resources

1043
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,560
within our networks not every resource

1044
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,679
is equivalent equivalently valuable so

1045
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,078
we certainly know that things like

1046
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,159
domain

1047
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,399
controllers are critically valuable for

1048
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,599
the sake of network operations

1049
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,000
but it may be that we also have servers

1050
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,079
or

1051
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,480
workstations in our environment that are

1052
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,040
also fundamentally value because they

1053
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,599
control

1054
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,960
fundamental aspects of the business in

1055
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,800
such a fashion that

1056
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,800
if that workstation or that server is

1057
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,520
corrupted disrupted or data from it is

1058
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,200
lost

1059
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,280
we are undermining the ability of the

1060
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,040
organization to function properly

1061
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,440
such that we need to defend that at all

1062
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,920
costs whereas some random workstation

1063
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,520
in accounting or hr well we don't want

1064
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,359
that to be compromised

1065
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,119
if it gets hit with ransomware it's fine

1066
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,359
because we can recover that machine

1067
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,640
without negatively impacting the overall

1068
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,960
value proposition

1069
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,759
of the organization so really looking at

1070
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,240
a

1071
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,520
function based or functional level of

1072
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,720
defense that is

1073
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,359
tied to different aspects of where it is

1074
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,399
the organization generates and maintains

1075
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,000
uh value next figure out how that

1076
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,000
overlaps with the cybers

1077
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,440
so what information systems map to those

1078
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,599
critical value sources

1079
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,560
uh you know this can include things like

1080
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,000
where the

1081
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,078
design models are kept for a

1082
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,880
manufacturing environment or where the

1083
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,560
trading algorithms are housed for a

1084
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,560
financial services company

1085
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,920
or where the key intellectual property

1086
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,839
is located for

1087
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,920
any sort of research and development uh

1088
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,920
organization and then figuring out what

1089
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,839
i.t capabilities are necessary

1090
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:17,280
in order to continue and facilitate uh

1091
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:19,040
that value generation finally

1092
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,640
then figure out does your defensive

1093
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,040
capability

1094
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,319
and it visible visibility extend to

1095
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,240
these critical assets

1096
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,320
this is where the industrial control

1097
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,160
perspective becomes quite handy because

1098
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,079
what we often see is that critical

1099
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,839
sources of organizational value

1100
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,320
like the actual production environments

1101
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:39,599
that enable a manufacturer to

1102
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,520
exist and to do their jobs lack the sort

1103
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,599
of visibility necessary to adequately

1104
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,599
defend and monitor those environments

1105
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,119
whereas different parts of the network

1106
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,960
that aren't really vital to the

1107
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,280
existence of the organization

1108
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,599
like all the computers in hr for example

1109
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,599
they're important but if they go away

1110
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,839
the business can still function if the

1111
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,440
plant floor network goes down though

1112
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,960
production ceases the organization

1113
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,359
begins losing lots of money

1114
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,960
yet we expend lots of effort on building

1115
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,400
out defense for these

1116
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,160
non-vital networks you know they're

1117
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,760
still important but they're not vital

1118
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,200
while ignoring some of these vital

1119
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,599
resources that if they were to get

1120
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,759
compromised or disrupted in some fashion

1121
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,800
would lead to critical losses for the

1122
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,280
organization as a whole

1123
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,359
so finally this also extends not just to

1124
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,839
preventative defense but building out

1125
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,640
resiliency as well because we can't

1126
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,480
always be

1127
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,560
certain that we will stop every single

1128
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,320
attack setting that as a goal

1129
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,400
is not only unrealistic it is quite

1130
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,640
impossible which means we must also

1131
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,040
build into the concept of operations

1132
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,598
resiliency and recovery this means not

1133
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,839
just the ability to

1134
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,839
restore a workstation but also when it

1135
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,000
comes to critical processes within our

1136
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,000
environment or critical business aspects

1137
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,680
can we not just restore a computer but

1138
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,520
are we restoring information

1139
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,799
are we restoring configurations and

1140
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,040
other such items

1141
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,079
uh so that we can not only bring up the

1142
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,040
logical asset

1143
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,359
but also bring up things to a known good

1144
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,279
uh

1145
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:06,240
known level of integrity after an

1146
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,240
incident takes place

1147
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,040
part of all this so we're at zefcon this

1148
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,200
is where red beats blue right

1149
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,240
well that also means that these concepts

1150
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,598
of trying to

1151
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,439
focus network defense around

1152
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,680
organizational value and understanding

1153
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,000
process dependencies

1154
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,919
needs to be adequately tested and

1155
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,800
audited and the best way to do that

1156
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,400
is through testing these plans and

1157
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,440
trying to observe exactly how it is that

1158
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,359
we're doing

1159
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,680
when it comes to trying to build out a

1160
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,598
organizationally specific operationally

1161
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,919
resilient defensive planning

1162
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,040
so the way we can do this and doing this

1163
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,480
through an actual pen

1164
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,320
test is difficult but certainly things

1165
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,800
like tabletop exercises

1166
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,640
or walk-throughs of incident response

1167
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,240
and defensive plans and

1168
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,920
doing a critical look at things like

1169
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,598
where our network visibility and where

1170
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,320
our network defense is enabled

1171
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,280
can allow us to try and identify areas

1172
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,160
where we're weak

1173
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,000
or where we need to build out greater

1174
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,759
amounts of detection and visibility

1175
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,079
so we can take our defensive measures

1176
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,640
and our recovery plans and run them

1177
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,320
against

1178
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,240
comprehensive attack scenarios that

1179
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,440
don't just look at hey i can get domain

1180
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,200
admin but rather

1181
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,880
a tech scenarios that look for

1182
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,160
objectives like hey i want to put your

1183
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,880
company out of business

1184
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,359
or hey i want to shut your organization

1185
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,440
down

1186
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,440
for seven days or something along those

1187
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,839
lines and how would i go about doing

1188
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,960
that

1189
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,960
not just what networks would be breached

1190
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,040
but what are the critical touch points i

1191
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,040
would need to compromise or disable

1192
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,119
that would enable this sort of event and

1193
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,240
this allows us to begin identifying gaps

1194
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,720
or missed vectors

1195
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,240
as part of our existing defensive plans

1196
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,919
and building out a more

1197
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:48,399
holistic or uh greater in scope

1198
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,440
defensive uh planning that can take into

1199
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,359
consideration

1200
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,720
these sorts of scenarios so yes

1201
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,520
something very much like a purple team

1202
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,759
exercise

1203
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,520
that incorporates not just your i.t

1204
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,079
personnel but also

1205
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,520
the individuals that are responsible for

1206
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,560
how it is your organization is

1207
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,000
generating value

1208
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,078
whether that's the manufacturing

1209
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,839
environment the operations personnel

1210
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,480
responsible for how the bank runs

1211
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,200
etc to try to identify what are those

1212
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,040
critical

1213
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,919
items that are necessary for the

1214
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,319
organization to continue operating

1215
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,280
okay so to close out what are my future

1216
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,800
expectations

1217
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,400
in this space so i think this is a

1218
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,400
fascinating topic and it's not something

1219
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,000
that is typically covered

1220
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,920
from a cyber perspective because it

1221
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,200
involves lots of understanding of

1222
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,240
business environments and how it

1223
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,480
networks overlap

1224
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,319
with more general operations well the

1225
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,000
thing is is that we don't have a choice

1226
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,319
because attackers are getting smarter

1227
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,240
and bolder when it comes to these sorts

1228
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:45,359
of operations that have been doing so

1229
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,680
going back at least through 2014 um

1230
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,598
and are doing so in a way as time has

1231
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,598
progressed from there to becoming

1232
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,680
uh more targeted more disruptive and

1233
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,599
potentially outright damaging

1234
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,359
as we saw with the ab cake strike such

1235
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,000
that organizational defenses have no

1236
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,720
choice but

1237
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,079
to evolve with adversaries to meet these

1238
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,839
challenges and to try and build out

1239
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,880
defense in such a way that we

1240
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,640
are enabling our employers or

1241
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,160
the networks that we're responsible for

1242
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,560
defending to

1243
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,319
counter these sorts of challenges so

1244
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,078
from a defender's standpoint we have to

1245
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,800
start embracing a mindset where cyber

1246
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,319
defense

1247
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,160
is more than just the network the

1248
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,000
network is just the

1249
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,399
medium through which attackers interact

1250
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,640
with things we need to understand how

1251
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,240
information systems control impact or

1252
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,240
enable organizational value

1253
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,598
creation and how attackers can take

1254
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,479
advantage of that to

1255
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,319
do real harm to the entities that we

1256
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,319
were responsible for defending

1257
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,599
this gives us a wider scope necessary

1258
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,680
for implementing and

1259
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,520
maintaining defense that we need to

1260
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,879
expand our horizons and maybe bring in

1261
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,000
different stakeholders than we're used

1262
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,240
to talking to

1263
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
to design defensive planning establish

1264
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,319
things like priorities

1265
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,079
identifying vital systems and how it is

1266
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,880
that our defensive planning

1267
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,839
adapts to these critical components in

1268
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,280
terms of incidents

1269
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,960
i don't expect things to get better in

1270
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,720
fact i expect things to get worse

1271
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,359
uh you know does that mean that we'll

1272
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,640
see experiences as a result of cyber

1273
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,799
probably not because there's lots of

1274
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,160
other safety controls that come into

1275
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,079
play but attackers are

1276
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,200
they're trying pretty damn hard in order

1277
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,720
to get to

1278
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,118
this level of uh complexity and

1279
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,000
uh potential damage but we also see this

1280
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,359
in things like

1281
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,240
election security um multiple organism

1282
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,560
entities are attempting to somehow

1283
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,319
influence or undermine the u.s election

1284
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,839
that is coming up in a couple of months

1285
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,400
but we even see things like this if we

1286
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,520
want to go

1287
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,520
all the way back to the 2011 2012

1288
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,119
operation abba bill campaigns against

1289
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,800
the u.s financial system

1290
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,520
that we can see these sorts of scenarios

1291
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,040
playing out in other areas as well

1292
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,640
that can have significant economic

1293
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,400
impacts not just to our own

1294
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,240
organizations but even to entire

1295
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,560
countries or entire regions

1296
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,319
that are economically interlinked so

1297
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,160
lots of possibilities here for attackers

1298
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,400
to do nasty stuff

1299
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,359
so to conclude as i'm coming up on time

1300
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,440
here

1301
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,799
organization defense is more than just

1302
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,400
cyber but

1303
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,000
cyber is increasingly connected to

1304
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,520
multiple sources of value

1305
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,760
whereas previously lots of things would

1306
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,000
have been physical process control only

1307
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,839
instead we've expanded networking we've

1308
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,800
expanded links to the cloud

1309
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:19,440
to msps into other organizations such

1310
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,079
that we now operate environments with

1311
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,800
lots of both internal and external links

1312
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,839
that

1313
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,000
produce potential dependencies and

1314
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,759
potential

1315
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,440
disruption points that didn't exist

1316
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,560
previously that we need to be aware of

1317
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,640
and plan for

1318
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,759
unfortunately adversaries understand

1319
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,598
these weaknesses

1320
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,119
and are attacking them one example we

1321
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,560
didn't talk about

1322
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,200
but i've kind of hinted that multiple

1323
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,480
times is third party service providers

1324
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,720
like msps

1325
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,920
are increasingly targeted by attackers

1326
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,319
whether as a means

1327
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,280
of infiltrating their client

1328
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,480
organizations

1329
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,680
or as a means to impacting organizations

1330
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,000
in other fashions

1331
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,160
but we need we seldom think about our

1332
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,160
msps as part of our defensive planning

1333
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,240
uh and yet we're highly reliant on these

1334
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,040
third parties for our own organization's

1335
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,640
uh day-to-day operation so overall in

1336
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,119
looking at all these items

1337
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,440
vendors suppliers third-party links but

1338
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,079
also internal network connectivity

1339
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,560
and uh inter-process dependency defense

1340
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,400
has to

1341
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,720
evolve and become more aware of the

1342
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,160
context in which we're operating

1343
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,240
so that we're not just making sure that

1344
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,839
bob's workstation in accounting doesn't

1345
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,439
get ransomware installed on it

1346
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,920
but to make sure that the entire

1347
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,119
organization doesn't fail or doesn't go

1348
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,520
bankrupt as a result

1349
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,960
of an attack that wipes out a critical

1350
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,119
source of value that allows the

1351
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,240
organization to continue existing in the

1352
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,160
first place

1353
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,078
so these slides will be made available i

1354
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,520
don't know where yet i'll tweet them and

1355
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,359
and whatnot but i know xiv con is

1356
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,200
recording this as well here are

1357
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,560
a bunch of references that if you'd like

1358
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,078
to get into any of the

1359
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,240
examples that i talked about or some of

1360
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,599
the concepts in greater detail a number

1361
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,040
of things that i've written as well as

1362
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,280
some excellent reports

1363
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,960
from eset and fireeye on a couple of

1364
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,560
these examples as well

1365
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,880
but i know that we're up on time and

1366
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,640
this is the last talk of the day

1367
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,920
some people are probably burnt out at

1368
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,359
this point but if there are any

1369
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,480
questions i'm happy to entertain them

1370
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,720
here

1371
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:19,200
certainly could hit me up in other areas

1372
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:19,200
as well
