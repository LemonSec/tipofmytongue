1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,850
so Paul Colligan

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,740
I'm from the u.s. specifically live in

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:19,369
Huntsville Alabama down in the southeast

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,230
corner of the US my primarily my

5
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:23,119
experience is in network infrastructure

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:27,109
service provider telecommunications

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:30,079
utilities both implementing architecting

8
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:33,200
and securing the network critical in

9
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,240
network infrastructure and also the

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,500
heavy emphasis on penetration testing

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:42,140
and and today for the last three years

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:47,390
up specifically 100% focused on red

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:49,130
teaming but as I mentioned I got I've

14
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,620
been reading like everyone a lot about

15
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,140
the so7 protocols that are being hacked

16
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,510
and having a telecom telecom background

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,250
my experience was always in the data

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,199
side were just a little bit of voice

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,690
experience I primarily just provided

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,360
transport for the voice services and

21
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,190
worked more on the data and the cable TV

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,710
side of the house for service provider

23
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,750
and I've started thinking it's like we

24
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,580
were seeing others publications about

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,530
this a seven protocol vulnerabilities

26
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:19,070
and I was like well how does someone

27
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,720
actually get access to exploit these ss7

28
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,119
more babies because those are typically

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,650
closed networks and I just openly

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,450
intentionally open to the Internet so so

31
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,159
here's some ideas if someone was going

32
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,720
to go after these networks how would

33
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,190
they get that initial hand hold so that

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,539
they could exploit the protocol

35
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,280
vulnerabilities that have been published

36
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,100
about a number of organizations here

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,930
recently so before we dive into that

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,048
let's do an overview of ss7 if you're

39
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,909
like me and you're you're not a

40
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:51,170
class-five switch operator if you're not

41
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:53,479
a voice carrier expert let's go and jump

42
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,750
in and do a quick overview of SS 7 so SS

43
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,280
7 is basically think of SS 7 is BGP the

44
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,610
border gateway protocol for the Internet

45
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,080
well SS 7 is the equivalent of BGP for

46
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,880
the PSTN the public switch telephone

47
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,200
network that's how all the different

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,258
voice networks around the world

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,170
communicate and just like we have these

50
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:14,000
open trust relationships with BGP so

51
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,809
that we all can communicate across the

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,420
Internet's Andy

53
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,980
you know surf the web etc well ss7

54
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,630
between all the different telco service

55
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,709
providers there's a trust relationship

56
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,880
that everybody's doing what they're

57
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,910
supposed to be doing and doing due

58
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,650
diligence and when and we know with like

59
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,230
BGP in the news not everybody's doing

60
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,390
what they're supposed to be doing right

61
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,160
in SSS 7 tool especially to a lot of

62
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,010
people like myself in Infosys

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,540
it's kind of like a black box we just

64
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,149
trust the voice guys to be doing

65
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:45,019
whatever it is they're magic in making

66
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:48,110
things work but so7 has been around us

67
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,600
got created initially like in the 70s by

68
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,190
AT&T

69
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,350
whenever whenever you're making phone

70
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,600
calls between your local exchange

71
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,769
carriers or central offices and what are

72
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,190
going to say your regional area your

73
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:03,770
cities when when I call leaves that

74
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,359
local area it is going to utilize ss7

75
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,420
when you're using your cell phone

76
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,020
network in roaming around all those

77
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,440
communications are happening with ss7

78
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,850
SMS SMS is using it the call blocking

79
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,940
emergency services in the u.s. we call

80
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:22,400
it e 9-1-1 for dialing emergency

81
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:27,680
services caller ID all those things

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,000
depend on ss7 protocol now when you

83
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,920
start talking about the architecture of

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,019
SSM you start talking to voice

85
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,369
telecommunications people you quickly

86
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,870
start getting and drowning in a whole

87
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:40,760
new set of acronyms and look and a few

88
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,470
of those acronyms are referring to the

89
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,328
note ops you have with the call signal

90
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,310
transport point and you can think of

91
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:50,540
that as a signal transport point the STP

92
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,430
think of it as a router for the PSTN for

93
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,859
the ss7 basically it's like an sa-7

94
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,000
router the way I would being an

95
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,140
old-school router person that's how I

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,299
think about it and it also has not only

97
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,250
does it routers to seven messages it

98
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,870
also has some basic filter capabilities

99
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,280
just like a router has access control

100
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,190
this capability some you know basic

101
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,780
filtering basic firewall capabilities

102
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,660
the STP has some basic filtering

103
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,459
capabilities as well built into and then

104
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,798
you get into what they call the service

105
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,810
switching point the SSP and that is what

106
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:25,280
we call a classify switch that is the

107
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,990
switch that in in the past it would fill

108
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,000
up a room it would be just ship rolls

109
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,970
and rolls

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,780
equipment that would fill up a room you

111
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:38,410
know maybe your Siemens Nortel Lucent

112
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:41,289
but if those rows and rows of equipment

113
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,570
and now it's been consolidated them to a

114
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,000
soft switch where it might be just one

115
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:49,510
21 inch rag whether with a couple of Sun

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,170
boxes a couple of UNIX boxes for

117
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,969
redundancy

118
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,470
you can consolidate all that down now

119
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,610
and then so it's the salt switch but

120
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,590
it's basically providing what they call

121
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,320
classified services where you can run

122
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,719
voice services for a whole city large

123
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,500
geographic area that's providing the

124
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,680
voice the fax the modem capability

125
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,990
dial-tone

126
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,000
services and then you get into what they

127
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,580
call the service Control Point the SCP

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,300
and as the database it has all the

129
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,760
numbers for say 800 numbers and the

130
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,680
cellular has you know the mobile

131
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,840
subscribers the different calling card

132
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,970
services etc does all gonna be in the

133
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,700
service control point the SCP which

134
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,010
being a database that's going to be a

135
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,300
target-rich environment to get ahold of

136
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:35,380
it's gonna have some good information in

137
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:38,080
it from a from a security standpoint so

138
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,360
from an architecture standpoint when we

139
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,979
talk about ss7 here's what we're talking

140
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,970
like I said I'm an old-school Network

141
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,830
person so I want to know how the

142
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:48,760
network's built everything for me is

143
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,830
about the network yeah so so here's what

144
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,090
the ss7 network architecture looks like

145
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,820
you have your STPs

146
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:58,780
they're in the network and they're going

147
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:00,340
to be connected to your SCP in your SSPs

148
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,770
we talked about that service control

149
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,479
point and at a service which point

150
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,760
they're gonna be connected with links

151
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,120
there's a lot of you specialized links

152
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,820
in ss7 and it's going to connect to

153
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,590
those services with eight links which

154
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,390
are basically and you know Europe and

155
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:21,909
most parts of the world it's going to be

156
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:24,610
ones in the US we use T ones but but but

157
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,380
you know when you're talking about SS 7

158
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,640
they have a specific terminology for the

159
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,520
functionality and features that are

160
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,530
being provided over those links so a

161
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,859
links are going to tie in your s CPS and

162
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:38,349
your SSPs back to the STP s basically

163
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,510
oxygen we're providing so7 routing

164
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,580
functionality

165
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,099
and at the bottom you can see where

166
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,690
you've got SSPs that they may be tied

167
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,300
together with f links and that

168
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,340
architecture may happen in a large city

169
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,370
environment say maybe say in Warsaw

170
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,619
where you have a really large city in

171
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,570
there such a dense population there

172
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,480
might be multiple switches and they're

173
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:03,320
tied together with SS with the SS

174
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:07,800
species are tied together with F links

175
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,480
if there's a for congestion and for

176
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,150
redundancy you may have what they call a

177
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,540
links or AAA links which are redundant a

178
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:18,810
links so that so the daily links have

179
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,940
redundancy for messaging if needed and

180
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,850
then in the center there we show C links

181
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,920
where you may have s tepees that are

182
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,230
clustered together and with if you have

183
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,640
STPs nodes that are clustered together

184
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,290
you would use seedlings to tie this

185
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,830
together and then those B links if we

186
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:36,240
see those Billings are used to tied if I

187
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,530
couldn't mention with the BGP where you

188
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,270
have the peering on the global Internet

189
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,549
those period points with the beaten

190
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,539
those beat links are used to tie in

191
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,590
different telco networks in the ss7

192
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:52,050
that's how they integrate together is

193
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:55,200
with B links then a real quick overview

194
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:57,210
of a sailor network architecture over on

195
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,099
the Left we have the base trans

196
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,560
transceiver stations which is going to

197
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,930
be your towers where you know we're our

198
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,880
mobile phones or mobile devices are

199
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,740
jumping on different RF channels and as

200
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,230
we roll them around we get on different

201
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,420
base transceiver station and those base

202
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,760
transceiver station Zoar controlled by

203
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,040
the base station controllers that are

204
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,719
that are managing and keeping up as with

205
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,730
us as we roam across different towers

206
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,300
and different networks and report back

207
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,440
up to the mobile switching Center and

208
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,770
and all of that infrastructure is

209
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,000
managed by the Operations Support

210
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,640
subsystem and think of that operations

211
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,140
support subsystems OSS is the NOC the

212
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,370
network operations center for all of

213
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,520
this that's where the management the

214
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,130
monitoring the health and status

215
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,169
configuration control is at the brains

216
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,540
about operation and it would also that

217
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,590
OSS would also connect into the business

218
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,699
systems of the telco enterprise network

219
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,640
and that's a very target rich

220
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,370
environment from my experience

221
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,649
that's but when you say that OSS think

222
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,959
lots of systems lots of databases lots

223
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:01,399
of apps lots of remote access from

224
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,430
vendors where they can get in and help

225
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:07,339
you know keep the services working and

226
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,890
also with our customers there's gonna be

227
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,360
trust relationships over to the right

228
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,860
where customers may be interacting and

229
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,740
automatically provision of services from

230
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,390
home possibly to a soft switch web

231
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,209
interface that kind of integration can

232
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,319
be happening in an era stores in

233
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:23,479
interests and trust relationships to be

234
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,560
audited audited there and evaluated and

235
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,990
then you get down here in the mobile

236
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,130
switching Center and down the mobile

237
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,410
switching center that's where the real

238
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,600
brains of the operation is for the for

239
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,500
your sailor Network and that's where you

240
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,839
got your your home location register

241
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,880
that uh that service that system is

242
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,490
keeping up with the cell phones that are

243
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,380
that are a part of that sailor Network

244
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,130
and you got the authentic authentication

245
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:51,050
center that is associated with the HLR

246
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,140
and that's where your SIM cards are

247
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,240
being authenticated to verify that that

248
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,560
your phone is good and that's gonna so

249
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,990
that's going to indicate your sims and

250
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,209
you got to visit visitors order location

251
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,220
register and that is and that system is

252
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:06,199
keeping up with users that are roaming

253
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,540
around the network when you leave your

254
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:10,550
network and you're on different part so

255
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,560
you say like I'm in the US and I'm over

256
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,260
here in Europe I'm reporting back to the

257
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,540
vlr the visitor location register that

258
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm not on my home network I'm not I'm

259
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,910
not back at the HLR I'm over here on

260
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,339
connected I'm roaming so you have vlr

261
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,019
will keep up with that and then you got

262
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:28,550
your equipment identity register and

263
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,199
what that's doing is it's gonna keep up

264
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,380
with stolen phones phones they may be

265
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:36,439
rogue that may be lost

266
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:38,630
etc and then again you're getting all of

267
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,240
this is gonna be integrated and tied in

268
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:43,579
with other telcos based on that

269
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:49,550
architecture we showed previously with

270
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:51,290
all the with the PSTN I'm gonna say I'm

271
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,109
an old-school nowhere person to me I'm

272
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,730
all about the pcap I want to see we can

273
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,079
talk we can talk all these protocols and

274
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,390
acronyms but I want to say the narrow I

275
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,649
want to see a peek out I want to see if

276
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,290
I want to say what does a pack capsule

277
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:04,430
or like so here here's what a packet

278
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,930
capture

279
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,640
really a frame capture I guess you would

280
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:10,790
say because this is there's no ways

281
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,140
you'll see in here there's no IP we're

282
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,649
looking at a frame and then we drop down

283
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:17,990
into ss7 messages and down here I got a

284
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,790
circled here you can see where right

285
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,010
here you got eyes the end it's

286
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:25,099
encapsulated in these message transfer

287
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,490
part level frames here and then you can

288
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,990
see where we're got a calling number and

289
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:32,959
a called number and the calling number

290
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:35,959
here so there's no IP this was all pure

291
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,489
dialing and over eyes D in here and this

292
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:38,770
count of capture would not be happening

293
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,589
over Ethernet you would have to have a

294
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:44,480
specialized test set typically in the

295
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:46,610
u.s. what I'm familiar with is a test

296
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,790
set called a t-bird they will go in and

297
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:53,510
capture frames off off of like a II 1

298
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:55,279
III t1 t3 where you can capture those

299
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,720
frames at that level and then you can

300
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,339
take it and you can import it into a

301
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,970
tool like Wireshark or whatever your

302
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:03,620
favorite protocol analyzer is I don't

303
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,940
want you to see this for reference now

304
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,220
here now here's where things are

305
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,839
interesting because you know we're all a

306
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,459
bunch info sick folks we want it all on

307
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,740
IP where we can ping it and we can

308
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:15,380
target it and we can you know point

309
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:18,470
Metasploit at it right go hack the world

310
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:20,480
so here's what here's an example of

311
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,950
where you can see you got your frame you

312
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,589
got your Ethernet and we have IP and

313
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:27,080
then the ss7 is encapsulated in IP so

314
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:29,240
the world of today and tomorrow that

315
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:33,440
says the seven network that that used to

316
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:36,680
be just a clothes non IP not ping Keable

317
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,510
from the world is is brought online and

318
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,189
now we can ping it and we can route to

319
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,500
it and so we can go and put in backdoors

320
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,839
we can get access and you know drop in

321
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,339
whatever our favorite tool is for

322
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,339
backdooring the network you know where

323
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:52,579
there's a pineapple or some kind of 3G

324
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:56,029
4G 5g backdoor device on that network

325
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:57,469
and be able to from our laptop anywhere

326
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:00,160
in the world be able to integrate in

327
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:05,709
with this ss7 network and influence

328
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:09,230
communications because it's all in IP so

329
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:13,449
here's where I want here's where I want

330
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:15,620
to focus it get you to think about is

331
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,029
here's here's an example of what a

332
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,170
telecommunications network might look

333
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,680
like I spent 50

334
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:23,540
years building service providers telcos

335
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,979
utilities where was River the services

336
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,300
were all converging together is getting

337
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,310
hard to tell the difference between a

338
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,079
cable company a phone company and a

339
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,209
utility except for the utilities

340
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,969
provided services like gas water and

341
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:36,138
power that was their differentiator but

342
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,290
they were all going and getting into

343
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:42,800
offering cable TV voice and Internet

344
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:45,980
services in Metro Ethernet etc services

345
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,599
to their customers but they all have a

346
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,339
lot of common services so what you have

347
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,730
is you've got the video head in you've

348
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:54,529
got their voice which their soft switch

349
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,649
which is basically a lot of times might

350
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:59,180
be a redundant Solaris boxes running

351
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:02,360
whatever vendor out they choose for

352
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:05,060
their class-five switch you've got

353
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,740
different services for monitoring for

354
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,180
billing integration the middleware and

355
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,100
then of course you've got your services

356
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,239
like lawful intercept where lawful

357
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,160
intercept we talked about yesterday in

358
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,290
my workshop lawful intercept is where

359
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,839
the government can come in and provide a

360
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,610
warrant provide paperwork to telco

361
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,040
service provider and say we want all the

362
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,440
traffic for this individual and so when

363
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,269
that is provided then the

364
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,420
telecommunications infrastructure

365
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:31,760
provider will will enable capability so

366
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,010
that a and B start talking a perfect

367
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,779
copy of sent to C and a and B have no

368
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,660
idea that a perfect copy of all their

369
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:41,570
communications is being sent to C that's

370
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,329
lawful intercept and that's used around

371
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,649
the world and you'll see that in all the

372
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:47,390
different vendor infrastructure both

373
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:48,949
network and voice and other specialized

374
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,709
telecommunications will have that

375
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:53,479
capability in the network and then

376
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:54,439
you're going down into the network and

377
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,550
you get down into their core

378
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,940
infrastructure and that's where you're

379
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:01,670
going to have the your MPLS core network

380
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:04,670
what I call BFRs big freakin routers no

381
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,500
routers as big as a door they're

382
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,870
basically you know blare three switches

383
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,459
with lots of ports lots of speeds and

384
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,170
feeds or you know and they're also going

385
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,420
to have your optical network where you

386
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,610
know your DWDM your sonnet in the u.s.

387
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,829
SDH and you're in other parts of the

388
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,470
world all of that magic is going to be

389
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:22,519
happening here at the core and then

390
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,430
you're going to drop down into the

391
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:28,040
access layer depending on the provider

392
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:30,199
in the business model they may be up

393
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,599
offering active Ethernet which is

394
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:34,599
basically Ethernet out to

395
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:38,560
the business or the customer home or

396
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,630
passive optical as an architecture maybe

397
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,779
that you know they're still offering t1

398
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:46,930
e1 and DSL services in some parts of the

399
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:49,990
world but the key thing that I want you

400
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,008
to get out of this is I've seen that if

401
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,649
you're when you're out there buying

402
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:54,850
services and you're negotiating for your

403
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:58,449
large critical infrastructure

404
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,720
organizations you've got to rid you've

405
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:03,719
got to dig in and ask the hard questions

406
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,100
because because here's the thing that

407
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,160
people don't know and they don't want

408
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,540
anybody ask the hard questions about all

409
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,660
majority of these services and solutions

410
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,130
are backdoor to high heaven I have read

411
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,009
the contracts I've been in the rooms

412
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:20,380
when they've been negotiated with with

413
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:22,779
providers and they I'm going to show you

414
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,730
some examples where they will have

415
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:27,610
remote access they'll have SSH access

416
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,889
they will have SSL X has some kind of

417
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,389
VPN where they drop in their own routers

418
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:34,870
they drop in their own firewalls and

419
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:38,290
totally bypass the infrastructure for

420
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,970
say the internet guys the the the IP the

421
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,800
people who are fluid in IP they

422
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,269
understand security risk and they

423
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,889
understand how to go and lock things

424
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,930
down but you get in like every

425
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:48,730
organization to get into politics and

426
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,739
you get into revenue streams and

427
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,240
business plans and you have the voice

428
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,550
you have the video and everybody's got

429
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,709
their own Empire and they have their own

430
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,750
political influence and they can come in

431
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:59,859
their vendors have a lot of power and

432
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,620
authority and they'll come in and

433
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,319
totally bypass in some cases the

434
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,339
security that the internet the people

435
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,839
that are fluent in the internet would

436
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:09,428
like to have in place I've seen them

437
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,639
just totally bypassed that and I'm gonna

438
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:14,409
go into some examples so I call this so

439
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,750
what I call this is the everybody talks

440
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:20,049
about the apt I call this the DPT the

441
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:23,589
vendor persistent threat I usually get

442
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:26,319
last with that so so I'll call it the VP

443
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,000
the vendor persistent threat because

444
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,158
because the vendors are putting in these

445
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,770
backdoors into these networks where they

446
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:34,360
can get this remote access and it says

447
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,549
this is and this was where we're going

448
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:41,850
to dive into how they maybe people can

449
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:41,850
get into the ss7 Network now

450
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,730
well what's one strategy people before

451
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,890
if you know if you're a consultant

452
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:53,320
company or you're involved with auditing

453
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,730
critical infrastructure maybe you know

454
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,809
maybe you work for a big consulting

455
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,950
company or you have associations with

456
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:01,899
government agencies and you're out doing

457
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,730
auditing and evaluating the security you

458
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,080
have critical infrastructure or maybe

459
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,240
you work for a critical infrastructure

460
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,460
vendor and you're looking saying here's

461
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,169
here's a contestant here's how I like to

462
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,059
look at networks I like to go when

463
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:14,650
you're going to do all my recon get all

464
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:16,330
my Intel find out all the open-source

465
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,980
information because one thing he said

466
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,658
Ivan but you learn about that in the

467
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,490
telecom industry is everybody really

468
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:24,130
brags a lot about what they bought and

469
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:26,049
purchased it likes to get their name put

470
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,929
out there and press releases that they

471
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:31,570
implemented X Y Z's routers X Y Z's you

472
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:33,850
know Sall switches or cable TV head in

473
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,289
and they put all that information out

474
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,789
there and then it makes it real easy to

475
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:38,440
go and figure out what vendors you need

476
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:40,600
to go find out who the field engineers

477
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,360
are that may be working on-site and have

478
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,908
a laptop with everybody's infrastructure

479
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,770
information with everybody's static

480
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:49,840
passwords and user name you know usually

481
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,299
passwords so you know who did you know

482
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,299
who to go after if you're about you know

483
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:58,389
if you're about you know a hacker

484
00:18:54,299 --> 00:19:00,549
unauthorized hacker a black hat you

485
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,020
would know who to go Target so you could

486
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:03,400
pick it back off their laptop to go in

487
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,840
and export to trace relationships to get

488
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,360
in these networks so you're going and

489
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,100
looking at that network management you

490
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,990
know the billing system the middleware

491
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,980
that's time the billing system to the

492
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:16,900
provisioning for the network you can go

493
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,419
and figure out reverse engineer how the

494
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,620
vendors do remote access because one

495
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:22,030
thing they are they're consistent around

496
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,549
the world if you can get in the head of

497
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:27,100
a vendor infilled engineers of how they

498
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:28,720
access these from these networks you can

499
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,090
go and get a get into all of them across

500
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,429
the world because they're consistent if

501
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,860
they do ssh in europe they're doing ssh

502
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:37,480
probably in yes and when i can I say yes

503
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,399
SSH I'm talking about wide open

504
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,789
brute-force it until you get in SSH

505
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:48,030
access totally wide open no no count

506
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:48,030
lock out real simple to guest passwords

507
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,090
and so you figure out those trust

508
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,260
relationship so you figure out those

509
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,590
trust relationships between those

510
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:59,800
vendors and and and then develop

511
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,449
yourself an attack tree and then and

512
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,740
then you can you're most likely you're

513
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,180
going to find a way into the network

514
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,650
you're gonna find some vulnerabilities

515
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,200
and some access into the network if you

516
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:10,060
do a good job here so here's a real

517
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,720
world example I like to do route I like

518
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:16,120
to go in too and use real world examples

519
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,620
- the guilty to protect myself and you

520
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,520
know protect them obviously the most

521
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:24,699
importantly to protect me these are this

522
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,040
is some real world stories here I've

523
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,660
seen this numerous times what will

524
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,550
happen is we have in the militant

525
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,800
network here we have a transport network

526
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:35,770
and this is the speeds and thieves the

527
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,020
backbone of a utility telco service

528
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:40,200
evader this is you know the optical

529
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,720
network the TDM the trenton the

530
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,470
telecommunications the you know

531
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,860
infrastructure where they're provided

532
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:51,940
provision in Yvonne's tyonne's

533
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:53,830
III t3s all of that is you know Gigabit

534
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,460
Ethernet all that has been provisioned

535
00:20:53,830 --> 00:21:00,250
across this transport network here and

536
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,440
across those services they may have you

537
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:05,020
know their voice network here you know

538
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,310
their ss7 there's all switch services

539
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,230
their cable TV all of that

540
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,540
infrastructures all those services are

541
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,820
gonna run across this and what I've seen

542
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,590
for both the transport network and for

543
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,110
the end for these voice networks I seen

544
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:19,750
this in in multiple cases around the

545
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:23,709
world is where the vendors dropped in

546
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:26,380
Linux boxes multi homes one leg into the

547
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:30,240
to the network management portion of

548
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:32,350
these networks to secure you know

549
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,970
air-gap how many times they know that

550
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,800
someone most abused terms and Infosys

551
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,650
you know networking in InfoSec nineteen

552
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,940
generals air gap so these air gap and

553
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,620
network management networks and what

554
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,040
they do is they'll drop in a Linux box

555
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:47,050
was limb one leg into the management for

556
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,960
say the voice network or for this

557
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:52,030
transport network and then they'll have

558
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,220
another leg the second Ethernet

559
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:56,710
connection that totally bypasses the

560
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,170
security that the I that the IT folks

561
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,120
put in that maybe the I the internet

562
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,700
service provider folks put in who really

563
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,260
understand how IP technologies

564
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,030
you know they understand this they

565
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,800
understand store and they understand how

566
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:10,500
to you know configure a Juniper or Cisco

567
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,210
firewall what have you these voice guys

568
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,630
don't and these vendors will go in and

569
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,820
drop these boxes in with an open s SH

570
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,050
service so that when they're out out on

571
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,300
the road what have you and the customer

572
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,770
has a problem the field engineer can go

573
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:26,159
and come back in and help and support

574
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:29,010
them and and what but what happens is

575
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,570
I've discovered is if they drop these

576
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,490
they drop these Mullenix boxes in

577
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,350
multi-home wide open to the world and

578
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,620
and they ain't getting hacked to high

579
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:39,570
heaven and in their ids is typically a

580
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,489
bank somewhere in the world calling an

581
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:43,260
element there that their networks got

582
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,570
popped and it's being used to attack

583
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,510
their bank you know please cease and

584
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:51,149
desist and it just amazes me many of

585
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:53,250
these cases the people who have hacked

586
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,630
these networks don't realize what

587
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,130
they've gotten access to because what

588
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,680
they've done is they've gotten access to

589
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,210
what they call the EMS the element

590
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,950
management system and think development

591
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:05,250
management system as the network

592
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:08,040
management system like SolarWinds HP

593
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,690
openview the equivalent for these

594
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,909
specialized equipment it might be the

595
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,460
boys switch it might be the optical gear

596
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:17,610
it might be the TDM give the sonic gear

597
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,500
or the read the router vendor that's

598
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:21,600
providing the MPLS transport services

599
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,610
and when you get into a specialized

600
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,040
vendor they call it an EMS and element

601
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:28,770
management and at EMS literally drop

602
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,360
that box in with multi homes in my head

603
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,740
just wants to explode when I get cuz

604
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,270
I'll get the call somewhere you know how

605
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,670
you know we've been hacked we're getting

606
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,780
letters and calls to stop hacking you

607
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,570
know and you're going digging oh my my

608
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,460
oh my goodness what who did this you

609
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,919
know will you literally spend a half

610
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,640
million dollars on security

611
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,190
infrastructure and you're just totally

612
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,530
bypassed it with a patch cable it's like

613
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:53,210
you know you know you just can't fix

614
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:58,110
some things became fixed politics right

615
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:59,610
so here's another example pretty

616
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,669
detailed example of a telco what you

617
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:06,360
have of how a telco might get hacked in

618
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:09,150
and someone get access into this esse

619
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:12,000
into the ss7 network similar to what we

620
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,950
just show the whole point is that's how

621
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,860
can we get access into that so7 network

622
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,510
how does it go down real

623
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,219
here's here's a more detailed diagram

624
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:22,470
and all these slides are being provided

625
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:27,120
to the conference so you can go and

626
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:29,700
study them offline so you have a network

627
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,320
operation worth the brains of the

628
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,679
operation is all the blinky lights are

629
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,510
being monitored II managed you got all

630
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:40,350
the vendors network management systems

631
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:42,480
uh monitoring and provisioning automated

632
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,340
you know doing health and status of the

633
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,850
network bringing new user services

634
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:49,320
online and all that brains and Intel is

635
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:51,540
happening here and it's integrated over

636
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,909
to the OSS as we showed on one of the

637
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,370
first slides which is also going to be

638
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,320
tied in to have the trust relationships

639
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:01,169
over to the enterprise where there's

640
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,510
business systems and accounting built in

641
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:05,070
you know the billing information

642
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:07,320
maybe user provisioning so that the

643
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,178
customer in customers can automatically

644
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,939
provision new services there's going to

645
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:13,830
be trust relationships into there that

646
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,600
opens up a whole other set of

647
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,730
opportunities if that hasn't been

648
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,840
secured again they got the VPT over

649
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,950
there the vendors there won't that

650
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,199
remote access into all that

651
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,059
infrastructure and so it comes down and

652
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,620
they have those trust relationships into

653
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:27,870
your core infrastructures we just

654
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,760
discussed you got your voice services

655
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:34,010
you've got your data services your gsm

656
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,780
3g 4g 5g services that are going to be

657
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:39,690
relying on these transport networks but

658
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:42,450
what I want to call you out to is maybe

659
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,040
they're doing MPLS maybe it's good they

660
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:47,250
got some legacy frame relay still out

661
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:50,360
there what have you but I had a I had a

662
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:54,600
personal experience where a customer

663
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:58,530
they built they had a very large wide

664
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:00,570
area network huge huge a huge network

665
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,490
like 60 something sites and they went

666
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:06,389
from one carrier migrated from one

667
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:08,700
carrier to a second carrier and as we

668
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,740
were transit we had to transition from

669
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,270
the first carrier to the second carrier

670
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,820
we had to buy all new brand new

671
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:17,429
infrastructure to get during this

672
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,990
migration this transition so the first

673
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:21,480
carrier every time we would go and cut

674
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:24,450
aside over from the from the first telco

675
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:27,419
to the second telco been dropping in new

676
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,480
router equipment the first the it turned

677
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,179
out that the

678
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,429
first telco vendor the the incumbent

679
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:34,870
there was being migrated off of they

680
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:37,210
just abandoned all their equipment in

681
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:40,570
place and so we ended up you know they

682
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:42,850
ended the customer cut over all their

683
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,220
sites and then through mergers and

684
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:47,110
acquisitions over doubled in size

685
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,360
customers like hey the first telco

686
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,189
abandoned all this equipment we're not

687
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,889
gonna buy all new routers because all

688
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:56,470
we're using is 64 K and 128 K

689
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:59,559
connections for IBM green screens you

690
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:01,179
know back to the mainframe type stuff we

691
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,399
don't we don't need high-speed routers

692
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:05,260
we're just gonna use this old stuff they

693
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,440
started doing recovery on these routers

694
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,000
and discover like all of the brains of

695
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,309
the operations because they just threw

696
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,809
it away somebody made a decision in a

697
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:15,129
spreadsheet that it wasn't good

698
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:16,660
economics to go and pull all that

699
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,040
equipment back well what did they leave

700
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,809
they left routers out there in place

701
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,210
with all the passwords all the routing

702
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:25,418
Polar's policies all this and impede

703
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:26,799
community strings or how the trust

704
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:29,620
relationships with the network

705
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,389
operations center there you know the

706
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,699
information on the boxes that are

707
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:36,010
collecting NetFlow the syslog servers

708
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:39,480
all of that Intel just said that left

709
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:41,830
out there I'm like oh my god

710
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,600
you know just left all that out there

711
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,070
and that's you know necessary and you

712
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,840
can only imagine all that same equipment

713
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,790
around the world is showing up on like

714
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,620
eBay and being sold

715
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:52,928
you know refurb and people are getting

716
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,699
access to stuff so that's that's a

717
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:56,169
that's another example of how people can

718
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,730
find their ways into the telco because

719
00:27:56,169 --> 00:28:00,130
this stuff is getting out there pushed a

720
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,510
lot some project managers are banding

721
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,710
all this equipment with all of that

722
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:06,280
Intel and not bringing it back and

723
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:08,020
having it destroyed properly and so so

724
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,840
you get that access you get all this

725
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,059
Intel you know now you can revert based

726
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,209
on what you've got from a remote site

727
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:18,190
where the the telco surf survivor is

728
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:20,890
providing managed services you know how

729
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,730
much you know the cloud you know it's

730
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,990
going to be secure because it's the

731
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:25,660
cloud right so they got a cloud-based

732
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:28,059
service and I go but then it's still

733
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,100
they got they got equipment out there at

734
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:31,570
the customer Prem and it's got all this

735
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,250
information with all this juicy

736
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,439
information with trust relationships so

737
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,510
now you can reverse engineer how this

738
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,190
made this cloud up here may work the NOC

739
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,820
may actually work and then all your

740
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:44,240
ideas go over to LinkedIn and fine

741
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,710
who your good targets are and figure out

742
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,210
how you're gonna pop them and pick it

743
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,410
back in if you don't even go you know

744
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,610
direct through their internet connection

745
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,370
or maybe through phishing an email

746
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,020
directly into the company you know me if

747
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,000
I was uh if I was a black hat I'd

748
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,530
probably just go after the user try to

749
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,320
figure out who their family members are

750
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:02,420
and target their spouse on Facebook or

751
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,790
Instagram you know go through some

752
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,500
social media service you find a way to

753
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:11,360
piggyback on their network connection

754
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:13,880
back in to the network just just one

755
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,040
thought but anyway this is this is a one

756
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:22,700
strategy that they could get someone

757
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:26,389
into a telco Network possibly know so we

758
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:28,550
so we've got into the telco we've got

759
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:32,420
we've covered a couple ways that someone

760
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:35,419
might break into the telco what are they

761
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:37,310
gonna do whatever how are things gonna

762
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:39,320
go down once they've gotten access into

763
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,530
that voice that's the Seven Network and

764
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,330
they got that initial handhold here well

765
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:49,100
if they're wanting to go and target the

766
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:50,210
mobile phone subscribers one things

767
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,129
they're gonna had they're gonna need is

768
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:54,410
they're gonna need to get the MC code

769
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:57,470
for that subscriber the MC code for the

770
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:59,360
phone is a unique identifier that all

771
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,740
the phones have that uniquely identify

772
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,479
you on the cell phone network so one

773
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,250
things they're gonna need to do is is

774
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,110
they might have your phone number they

775
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:08,600
may know the STP point code they've

776
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:10,550
figured that out through their Intel but

777
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,100
they need that MC code for that phone

778
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,510
and so what they what you can do is that

779
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,110
they have this access they can craft

780
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:21,890
messages and impersonate a SMS Center

781
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:25,010
and send a message up to the the home

782
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:27,220
location register for for that phone

783
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:29,540
number that they want to target and then

784
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,730
that home location register would

785
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,230
respond back and would go and say query

786
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,330
the visitor location register

787
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:37,520
information and it would figure out

788
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:39,470
where everything is that where the phone

789
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:44,180
the word the user is a and it would

790
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:46,460
return back to the attacker all of the

791
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,690
information they requested it's not only

792
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,700
now is he gonna have the phone number

793
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:51,890
he's going out the MC code he's gonna

794
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,080
know he's gonna know the visitor

795
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,500
location register so that he can go and

796
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,740
figure

797
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:00,169
where he's roaming at etc and now and

798
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:05,059
now we can start targeting this this

799
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:08,419
mobile user there's a one feature in SS

800
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:11,600
Evan that is being locked down the trend

801
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:13,340
based on my research the trend is this

802
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,490
feature is being locked down and taken

803
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:17,809
and taken away from the attack surface

804
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,490
but it's still out there and some

805
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:21,080
parcels were lock every feature nothing

806
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,850
is a hundred percent lock downs like X

807
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,168
when people everybody is shutting down

808
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:28,759
XP but there are some people that are

809
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:30,710
still running SP same thing with this

810
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:33,769
any time interrogation feature in SS 7

811
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:36,289
and what could happen is that it

812
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:38,330
attacker that has that gotten access to

813
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:40,070
this as the Seven Network can go and

814
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:43,668
send a query into the home location

815
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:46,519
register our use and and exploit the

816
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:48,350
anytime interrogation feature send up

817
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:50,299
have sending up a crafted packet to the

818
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:53,120
home location register and then it will

819
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:55,070
go inquiry the the visitor location

820
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,139
register and find out where that mobile

821
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:59,570
user is where that mobile phone that

822
00:31:57,139 --> 00:32:02,209
mobile access device is somewhere in the

823
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:04,009
world and when it finds out what book

824
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,720
visitor location register that is

825
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:07,190
located on what it's using like say if

826
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,830
they were targeting me they would go in

827
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,539
Turkey and hit my HL are my home

828
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:14,029
location register back in the US and

829
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:16,779
then find my the VL r that I've reported

830
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:20,779
to and they would go in an Ingo and hit

831
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:23,830
the local tower that I'm on and then it

832
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:27,019
would report back to the attacker hey

833
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:31,340
he's over in continue of this week and

834
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:33,289
it would bring that information back but

835
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,149
that but this anytime interrogation like

836
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:37,610
I said it is become that detect services

837
00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:39,620
slowly going away according to the

838
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,610
research I've done it's they're getting

839
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,350
shutting it down

840
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,928
but there's still all there's always

841
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:46,668
other vulnerabilities right they can you

842
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,960
close one door and there's always others

843
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:49,789
that are open and just waiting to be

844
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,450
discovered that hasn't had me locked

845
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:55,340
down yet so similarly we've still got

846
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,750
our access here by whatever means

847
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,970
whatever attack path we've come up with

848
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:02,269
and we start crafting package we can

849
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:05,960
still we can impersonate a home location

850
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:08,690
register say somebody wants to target

851
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,190
may say someone say in Asia

852
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,629
once they target me they could

853
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,899
impersonate my home location register

854
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:19,488
and send in requests and find out that

855
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:21,668
uh and send it into the so7 Network and

856
00:33:19,489 --> 00:33:24,079
find out that I'm over here in Poland

857
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:26,209
and find out the visitor location

858
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:28,339
register or I'm on because the home

859
00:33:26,209 --> 00:33:30,070
because my home location register will

860
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:32,089
report it back

861
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,218
they'll send that they'll go and hit

862
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:36,829
this vlr and it'll go out here inquiry

863
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:38,869
and find the tower that I own and find

864
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:42,109
the geographic region that I'm reporting

865
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:44,208
back to and send that back to to the

866
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:49,819
attacker that is basically impersonating

867
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:51,409
another MSC somewhere in the world and

868
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:54,440
then they would know where I'm located

869
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:58,429
out like you find me

870
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:01,329
if I was there go now what really what

871
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:03,469
really got me interested what I started

872
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:04,789
wanting to do this project for and do

873
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:06,199
this research and understand this better

874
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:12,168
was being able to do man in the military

875
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:14,899
is and so here's how this is so this is

876
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:16,038
a just like we can you know we could do

877
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:17,268
man in the mill tax off of local

878
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:19,490
Ethernet we can do man in the middle

879
00:34:17,268 --> 00:34:20,959
attacks say with like you know and I

880
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:22,638
talk about a lot in my previous talks

881
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,349
about being able to man and me love

882
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,970
talks both at the local level with

883
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:28,639
routing protocols inside the enterprise

884
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:30,379
or with BGP on the global Internet well

885
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,089
we can do the same thing with so7 we can

886
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:34,909
do a man-in-the-middle attack so we've

887
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:38,179
gotten access into the PSTN here onto

888
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:42,619
the ss7 through some telcos so7 access

889
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:45,710
that we've exploited we can we can go

890
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:48,049
and we can we can impersonate a mobile

891
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:51,500
switching center we can we can

892
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:55,879
impersonate a the Sailor Network here

893
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:57,589
and send up queries well actually not

894
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:59,509
worry about an update to the home

895
00:34:57,589 --> 00:35:02,410
location register and tell the whole

896
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:05,329
location register hey we're good

897
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:09,859
here's where we are now I'm actually in

898
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:12,500
Poland but I'm in New Zealand

899
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:14,779
I mean you he's that he's actually moved

900
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,130
to New Zealand he's no longer in Poland

901
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,750
his in new leaves England and started

902
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:19,039
sending updates just like you would like

903
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,539
say you know the council like with art

904
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,630
poison you know where your senator

905
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:23,760
poisoning

906
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:25,200
you're poisoning the art table well we

907
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,450
could go and poison the cell phone there

908
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,370
were poisoned the VLR the home the home

909
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:31,770
location register we could go on home

910
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,569
poisonous hlr is that hey anybody

911
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,670
looking for me

912
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:37,950
send them over this a7 network to this

913
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:40,320
this central office this at this part of

914
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:42,210
the so7 network down in New Zealand and

915
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,590
I'm saying in Poland this week and what

916
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,870
happened is they could have those calls

917
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:49,440
then redirect anybody that gives me

918
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:52,140
sends me calls or text messages can have

919
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,890
that redirected you know to the southern

920
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,299
most southern parts of the world it

921
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:00,690
reiterated my calls and in think it is

922
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:03,600
either capture it depending on the the

923
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,980
the platform that they've got set up

924
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,440
they could either just capture my

925
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,930
messages in the initial call set up or

926
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,340
that get forwarded on me I want to go

927
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,359
and forward it all the way on and then

928
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,680
you could control the intercept you

929
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,870
could intercept a phone call you can

930
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,359
intercept the text messages and the and

931
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:20,790
the in point I'm a no I could be sent

932
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,520
here in Poland and I know outside of the

933
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:25,170
delay of say a voice call maybe I'm

934
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,810
having a baby a delay in the voice

935
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:29,250
possibly because you came fake time you

936
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,080
can impersonate take a lot of things but

937
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,570
you came fake physics physics and

938
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:37,920
physics you can't you know speed of

939
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:39,870
light and time you can mess with so we

940
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,020
could go in and reroute calls and

941
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:49,160
messages and intercept anywhere in the

942
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:49,160
world some things to consider some tools

943
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:56,130
some for y'all that are consultants and

944
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,589
auditors pen testers red teamers out

945
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:01,770
there here there's a couple tools for

946
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:06,690
tests and so7 there's this a sick sick

947
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:09,240
point it's on github the the team at ER

948
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,100
NW they developed a tool called ss7

949
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,990
mapper if you're not familiar with the

950
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,970
ER NW and you're interested in

951
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:18,569
telecommunications or I cannot encourage

952
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:21,569
you strongly enough to go in and check

953
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:24,120
out the papers and blogs that the the ER

954
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:25,620
NW team have they're really really

955
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,310
strong in telecommunications and

956
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,140
networking

957
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:30,480
there were I'll I get a lot of

958
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:32,970
inspiration from and a lot of ideas from

959
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,130
the ER NW team really really sharp

960
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,470
engineers

961
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:38,229
also if you're working in that you find

962
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:41,180
yourself working in the telco survivor

963
00:37:38,229 --> 00:37:43,460
world there are firewalls for ss7

964
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,019
I spent 15 years working in that domain

965
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,059
and I can tell you I never had a

966
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:48,379
conversation with a voice company about

967
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:51,019
a voice fire while I was selling

968
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:54,019
firewalls to protect the enterprise out

969
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:55,939
of the network to protect the we were

970
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:57,288
protecting the video side the internet

971
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,079
side but I never heard it had a

972
00:37:57,289 --> 00:38:01,539
conversation about the voice side but

973
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,529
here here's some firewall

974
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:05,239
recommendations and if you're out there

975
00:38:03,529 --> 00:38:06,140
auditing I would I was treat some of

976
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:07,700
these networks some of these networks

977
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,319
have not been patched and updated

978
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,970
because it's kind of like a lot sounds

979
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:15,200
you get it working and nobody touches it

980
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:17,390
until somebody retires you just get away

981
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,729
and they just nobody touches unless the

982
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:21,788
vendor tells them to and approves it

983
00:38:19,729 --> 00:38:24,319
so if you're out there testing don't go

984
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:26,329
plop in with your Metasploit and you're

985
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:28,819
in map and your necess and just go

986
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:30,650
skating you may want to go make sure

987
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:32,749
that these systems are somewhat patched

988
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:36,170
or not going to crash and roll over too

989
00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:37,069
and you know have a panic attack when

990
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:40,489
you're going to start hitting it with

991
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:41,599
malformed packets and things in cases

992
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:43,869
you know you're dealing with some old

993
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,829
legacy stuff so be careful there and

994
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:49,039
like I said you know I showed you could

995
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:51,049
do man-in-the-middle against your SMS so

996
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,539
you need to go on relook at alternatives

997
00:38:51,049 --> 00:38:56,779
to SMS two-factor authentication because

998
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:59,180
it can be broken into and similarly I

999
00:38:56,779 --> 00:39:01,219
spent I spent over 15 years working with

1000
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,660
telco service providers and not only did

1001
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:04,339
we not have many conversations about

1002
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,868
firewalls for the voice side and their

1003
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:08,269
work we didn't talk about what I call

1004
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:10,190
svi secure visualization instrumentation

1005
00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:12,109
getting the net flow getting the network

1006
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:13,729
monitoring getting that visibility that

1007
00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:17,269
way all work real hard you know like the

1008
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:18,680
Splunk etc on that getting work on

1009
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:21,049
getting that in that voice Network so

1010
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,118
this your special your folks that are in

1011
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:25,880
the consulting this is something they go

1012
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,219
target I think there's some good

1013
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:32,450
business out there that our peers have

1014
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:34,729
not gone in and chased in the critical

1015
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:37,718
infrastructure world I've got lots of

1016
00:39:34,729 --> 00:39:41,118
references lots of pages of references

1017
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:45,140
this that I use to get get this

1018
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:47,299
information and learn this and like I

1019
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,370
said you can have the slides the slides

1020
00:39:47,299 --> 00:39:51,440
provided

1021
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:54,650
