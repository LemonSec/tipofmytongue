1
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,390
I am Alex this is Jason you will see

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,760
that a PT 28 is crossed out that is

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,160
because when I when we wrote this and

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,380
when we submitted it I was at fireEye

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,230
which tracks this particular activity is

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,288
a PT 28 now that I'm at CrowdStrike Li I

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,579
am used to tracking it as fancy bear and

8
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,039
what we're here to talk about today is

9
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:33,050
in the same vein of how attacks really

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,910
are complex events driven by human

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,468
beings as has been touched on by a

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:41,358
number of talks so far this morning how

13
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:42,980
misconceptions about what it means to be

14
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,649
a human being and deal with the human

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,209
consequences of activities like the

16
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:48,649
actors who are likely responsible for

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,690
fancy bear and things like that

18
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,340
specifically related to activity that

19
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,928
has been documented in recent US

20
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,920
government indictments over the last

21
00:00:53,929 --> 00:01:02,570
year can help inform a variety of both

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:06,290
blue and red team activities all right

23
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,880
so the normal disclaimers and I have to

24
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,159
actually read this word for word that's

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,839
the policy so I apologize we are here

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,520
speaking for on behalf of no one but

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,920
ourselves and in no way do either of us

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,030
represent in any sort of way possible at

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,240
least anymore if the United States

30
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,920
government and our analysis is based

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,860
entirely on assessments of open source

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,680
reporting and our own experiences both

33
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,240
together and separate but generalized in

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,530
a pretty understandable and obvious sort

35
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,449
of way as we go through this so we were

36
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,950
given a very kind introduction just to

37
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,560
kind of go over it a little bit we tried

38
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:43,159
to capture our own individual essences

39
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,770
up here in one image each I spend most

40
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,899
of my time tracking state Nexus

41
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,449
espionage I did it with a focus on

42
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:52,490
critical infrastructure at fire I I do

43
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,520
it more kind of in what I find super

44
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,048
interesting now that I'm at CrowdStrike

45
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,429
before that I did a lot of critical

46
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,579
infrastructure and cybersecurity

47
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:04,130
exercise stuff for the US government and

48
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:06,770
I feel like this is a general good

49
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:10,910
representation of what I look like on a

50
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,920
day to day basis at work and as I said

51
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,970
the introduction I've spent about 15

52
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,208
years in the US intelligence community

53
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,340
primarily

54
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,840
designing running managing executing

55
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,030
offensive cyber and tech operations all

56
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,280
over the world did that for like I said

57
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,739
about 15 years until about two years ago

58
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,370
when I left fled the Washington DC area

59
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,510
to another part of the United States and

60
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,099
began working in the private sector

61
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,140
security doing a lot of product stuff

62
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,819
and managed detection and response at a

63
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,129
company called East and tire where I am

64
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,629
now in those 15 years or sort of two

65
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,859
types of operations that I worked on and

66
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,899
I only touch on this because I'll become

67
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,250
relevant as we get through one is what

68
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,049
we would call remote operations right

69
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,370
where everyone can do their job in

70
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:48,989
shorts and flip-flops from the comfort

71
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,130
of their office at the end of the day

72
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,420
you get to go home and hang out with

73
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,060
your spouse and your dog and your cat

74
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,649
where you throw exploits at a target you

75
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,910
get in your Spearfish people you get

76
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,019
that moment where like we're in and

77
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,370
everyone gets happy and people get

78
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,280
awards and it's great and it's exciting

79
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,110
but not all the time are those networks

80
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,730
accessible remotely sometimes you can't

81
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,569
get in from 5,000 miles away and you

82
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,369
have to get a little bit more clever

83
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,540
about it in those scenarios where we

84
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,610
have things like closed access

85
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,048
operations some poor schmuck has got to

86
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,400
wear a backpack and in disguise with a

87
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:15,780
bunch of gear in that backpack and

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,610
wander around in a courtyard of an

89
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,470
office building or outside the walls of

90
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,900
a compound and try to do something

91
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,150
clever with the Wi-Fi or some other RF

92
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,590
thing to try to bridge access into a

93
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,060
network for someone else to do something

94
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,620
interesting with it and those sorts of

95
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,880
operations close access have a unique

96
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,280
nature about them and we'll talk about

97
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:37,049
that as we get deeper on fancy bear so

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,510
what we're here to talk about today is

99
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,430
basically the fact that with a lot of

100
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,048
state Nexus activity we come with a lot

101
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,180
of preconceived notions just kind of as

102
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:47,790
a baseline community and certainly the

103
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,500
general public does as do a lot of the

104
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,810
executives that we answer to especially

105
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:57,150
for serving corporate clients about how

106
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,190
state Nexus operations come to be and

107
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,780
what goes into making them and what you

108
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,880
can kind of draw out of them in

109
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,849
observing them and responding to them

110
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,910
and the reality is is that they're human

111
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:12,630
and like all human activities there is

112
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,889
chaos involved Murphy's law applies kind

113
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,720
of across the board here even though

114
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,299
there's the preconceived notion that if

115
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,560
you are looking at a set of activity

116
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,120
that has been attributed to a state

117
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,520
Nexus actor it's probably considered

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,110
very sophisticated but in reality there

119
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,469
is a lot more beneath the surface

120
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,939
that is people scrambling to find

121
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,039
solutions people scrambling to meet

122
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,180
requirements so on and so forth and so

123
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,729
that's what we want to address here

124
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,250
today and keep in mind these actors as

125
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,479
sophisticated as they may be at the end

126
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,919
of the day what they're trying to do is

127
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,389
make sure that you don't catch them or

128
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,889
that even if you do catch them that you

129
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,270
can't figure out who they are and if you

130
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:46,620
can figure out who they are that you

131
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,900
can't do anything to really harm them

132
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,330
right unlike criminal actors whose main

133
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,198
goal is likely profit make money and

134
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,270
then everything else is sort of

135
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,110
secondary to that these actors goal is

136
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,669
to not get caught

137
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,509
other than some weird corner cases where

138
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:59,128
they want to get caught right but

139
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:00,750
excluding those for a second for the

140
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:03,120
most part they're spending lots of time

141
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,860
energy money resources and people hours

142
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,870
to make sure that none of you in this

143
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,310
room can either emulate what they do or

144
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,780
detect them when they're doing it

145
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,069
right so it's a very purposeful thing

146
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,628
that they're trying to achieve and

147
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,550
because they're putting that much energy

148
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:16,319
and resourcing into doing that they are

149
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,580
often very effective at it that drives a

150
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:22,319
lot of the sort of analysis you end up

151
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,448
doing on them so the way we're going to

152
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,949
do that is primarily by looking at fancy

153
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,139
rare activity with a little bit of

154
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:29,729
sandworm activity as well and I'm gonna

155
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,490
mention this again in a few minutes but

156
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,419
to really concretely bound to where the

157
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,310
information that we're going to be

158
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,690
talking about comes from there were two

159
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,240
indictments issued by the United States

160
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,039
government against officers of Russian

161
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,409
military intelligence the GRU that were

162
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,440
issued over the last year the first was

163
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:48,089
issued in July of 2018 related to GRU

164
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,669
activities aimed to interfere in the

165
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:53,699
2016 US presidential election and there

166
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:56,779
was an October 2018 indictment targeting

167
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:59,009
GRU officers allegedly involved in

168
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:01,949
remote and closed access operations

169
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:03,740
targeting a variety of organizations

170
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:05,909
specifically those related to

171
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,180
anti-doping efforts in international

172
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:11,279
sport and chemical weapons analysis and

173
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,039
so we're gonna be really focusing within

174
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:20,849
the bounds of those datasets on activity

175
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:22,289
that can be linked to fancy bear so why

176
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:23,878
do we care right so it's already been

177
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:26,128
said I think no less than three times

178
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,839
today that attribution is important with

179
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:30,029
an asterisk next to it like is it it's

180
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,650
important in general but isn't important

181
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:33,810
is it important to you in your

182
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,039
enterprise at what level of attribute or

183
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,810
what level attribution is even relevant

184
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,789
to you right so what we're positing here

185
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,980
is that there is value Gennaro

186
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,540
an attribution knowing who did a thing

187
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,610
to you or who's doing a thing out there

188
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,120
in the wild and that the more detail you

189
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,530
have about that attribution the more

190
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,820
better excellent you can be in your

191
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,159
day-to-day activities whether your blue

192
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,330
team trying to detect those adversaries

193
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,950
and what they're doing right building a

194
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,539
detection engineering regime that can

195
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,130
detect the type of tactics tools and

196
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,690
techniques of those adversaries use or

197
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,740
if you're a red team you're trying to

198
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,719
emulate the nature of how those

199
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,800
adversaries behave so that you can

200
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,210
better prepare your enterprise for

201
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,980
detecting them in the future were you to

202
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,330
be targeted by them or maybe in some

203
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,040
cases because you know you're being

204
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:15,330
targeted by them through some particular

205
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,650
means so one of the one of the big

206
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,240
things that when Jason and I were coming

207
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,560
up with this talk was that there's like

208
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,210
I said there's this common conception

209
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,640
that if you're dealing with state Nexus

210
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,770
activity particularly from you know

211
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,840
specific States you're looking at

212
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,880
something that's sophisticated and well

213
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,369
thought out and well organized and so

214
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,590
there's this spectrum of highly orderly

215
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,570
entities and highly more so chaotic

216
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,609
entities you know on one end we have

217
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,130
there's the gr use coat of arms and on

218
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,570
the other hand we have the best open

219
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,130
source image that I could find if

220
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:48,000
somebody I thought represented that end

221
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,860
of the spectrum and you imagine

222
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,930
hacktivists and criminals are on one end

223
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,850
for the most part and state actors

224
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,400
particularly intelligence services are

225
00:07:53,850 --> 00:08:00,000
on the other with the idea that there's

226
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,590
more opportunistic there's more planning

227
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,640
on there's more opportunism on one end

228
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,590
more planning on the other more

229
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,240
reactionary activity on one end more Pro

230
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:11,219
activity on the other but in reality

231
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,470
things are really messy and I

232
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,330
intentionally made this slide messy and

233
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:19,260
not pretty to look at to reflect the

234
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:21,150
fact that there really is everybody's on

235
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,340
all ends of the spectrum for example

236
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,650
when I was at fire I they put out a blog

237
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,789
about fin 7 and it was noted in some of

238
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,400
the tweets and stuff that came out

239
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,290
around that that fin 7 has its own JIRA

240
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,079
instance for operations that they

241
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,880
maintained meticulously so there you

242
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,700
have an e crime actor definitely on the

243
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,110
highly ordered end of the spectrum on

244
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,970
the you know highly chaotic end of the

245
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,740
spectrum from state Nexus Joe brought up

246
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,470
earlier they didn't crash override they

247
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,940
made not one but two mistakes

248
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,950
kind of in the at the very end of the at

249
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,150
the very end of the attack so you can

250
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,040
see that it's not

251
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,470
one thing you can't fit these people

252
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,839
into one end of a spa spectrum or even

253
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,880
in one box on a spectrum it's you have

254
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,620
to be aware that with all of these

255
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,689
actors there's the potentiality for a

256
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,300
variety of types of behavior and varying

257
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:09,540
levels of chaotic behavior within any

258
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,099
given activity and no look to be fair

259
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,020
like this is this is really hard to

260
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,910
conceptualize because it's very fluid

261
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,170
and it's and it's dynamic and it changes

262
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,910
every second of every day for every

263
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,650
actor the previous version of this slide

264
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,079
was really nice and easy to understand

265
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,910
that mental framework that we have it's

266
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,140
it's not that way I'm not necessarily a

267
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,640
bad thing but it's important to remember

268
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,689
that that's not always necessarily the

269
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,589
case in particular we find that we have

270
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,600
organizational frameworks that even help

271
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:35,430
drive that particular methodology so for

272
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,650
example the pyramid of pain is a good

273
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,390
example of this where you have levels of

274
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,709
sophistication and what can be detected

275
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,939
right you start at the very bottom where

276
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,070
it's very basic and you work your way up

277
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,940
in a very serial way to the very top of

278
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,470
the pyramid where it's really

279
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,570
sophisticated and really hard to detect

280
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,550
are hard to change but that's a very

281
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,930
formulaic and organized way to look at

282
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,130
it which makes sense in our brains but

283
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,239
unfortunately doesn't really accurately

284
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,160
represent the way the actors work

285
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,140
instead they work a lot like this where

286
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,089
in some cases one operation for a

287
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,339
nation-state actor might be all the way

288
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:03,779
on the highly orderly side but that same

289
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,100
nation-state actor the next date could

290
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,839
be all the way on the highly chaotic

291
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,070
side but then most days of the week

292
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,300
they're sort of smack in the middle

293
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,830
they're running different operations

294
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:16,920
with various levels of complexity and

295
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:19,470
chaos so what are the implications of

296
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,719
this common misperceptions so the key to

297
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,040
remember is that the chaotic nature of

298
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,050
what's going on in that particular

299
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,969
country's leadership and strategic level

300
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,680
organizations impacts everybody and the

301
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,120
way to think about this is that chaos is

302
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,770
like water right for those of you that

303
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,660
have a basement or live in a wet climate

304
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,069
water that starts off at the top right

305
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,360
coming from the sky tends to find its

306
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,339
way down to your basement one way or the

307
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,140
other right in your basement floods

308
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:41,880
chaos is very much the same way there's

309
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,319
three levels where this operates so one

310
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,180
is the strategic level sort of the

311
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,920
hundred thousand foot level where you

312
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,479
have national level leadership the next

313
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,709
level down is sort of operational where

314
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,000
you have people making decisions about

315
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:52,680
what operations we're doing and how

316
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
we're doing them and that bottom most

317
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,189
layers are tactical the people actually

318
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,870
on keyboard walking around the compounds

319
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,640
with a backpack wearing a disguise doing

320
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,290
stupid things that people actually

321
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,300
execute those operations those three

322
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,610
levels get affected in a variety of

323
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,870
different ways depending on the nature

324
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:10,700
of that chaos and how much of it you see

325
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:12,079
at the highest levels so that water can

326
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,029
manifest in a couple of different ways

327
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,439
and I'm going to talk about four of them

328
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:19,339
and the big ones are strategic culture

329
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,110
organizational culture and and kind of

330
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:24,170
the competition between organizations

331
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:26,660
which is sort of a an evolution of sorts

332
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,279
of strategic culture leadership demands

333
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,740
which can vary significantly and how

334
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:33,350
they impact operations from one type of

335
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,920
government to another and then finally

336
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,470
domestic politics which often influences

337
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,269
all of the other ones as well and what

338
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,570
all of this water does is you know this

339
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,190
idea that oh you know the Intelligence

340
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,649
Agency X decides that they need to

341
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,420
compromise target a so they go out and

342
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:53,029
plan the operation and just get to do it

343
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,620
there's there's no simple conceive and

344
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,480
execute plan when you're dealing with

345
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,800
all of these different variables

346
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:04,130
affecting the way that you're trying to

347
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:05,870
move forward so as I studied on before

348
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,700
the information in the case study that

349
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,560
we're doing here is very much based in

350
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,750
information from open sources from US

351
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,219
government indictments so I'm gonna slow

352
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,779
down here for a second because if I

353
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,269
don't what we're all about to say

354
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:19,610
doesn't make any sense so there's two

355
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,660
units that have been indicted 2gr units

356
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,720
that have been tightened by the US

357
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:27,199
government two six one sixty five and

358
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:30,940
seven four four five five activity that

359
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:35,750
was described in u.s. indictments in

360
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:37,550
2018 in July of 2018 links to six one

361
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,800
six five two activity that has been

362
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,859
publicly attributed in blogs and in

363
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,390
press reporting to apt 28 also known as

364
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,300
fancy bear

365
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:49,220
so by that causality you can look at

366
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,649
unit two six one sixty five and then

367
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,899
draw a dotted line to activity

368
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:56,420
associated with them in an indictment in

369
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,160
October of 2018 targeting anti-doping

370
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,660
organizations and chemical weapon

371
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,620
organizations and say that there is a

372
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,390
reasonable way to make an assumption

373
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,600
that there could be a link between the

374
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:11,120
fancy bear activity and unit two six one

375
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,550
six five in that context in the same

376
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,209
extent unit seven four four five five

377
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:18,620
was charged in the excuse me

378
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:20,449
July 2018

379
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,180
indictment as related to certain

380
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:26,050
influence aspects and other activities

381
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,339
related to election interference in 2016

382
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,859
they were also cited as being involved

383
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:33,530
in certain influence activities related

384
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,360
to targeting of anti-doping

385
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:38,240
organizations in the October 2018

386
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,040
indictment now that's all on the one

387
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,010
side on the other side you have press

388
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,780
reporting in the US that linked unit

389
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,300
seven four four five five to not Pecha

390
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,089
which has been attributed basically by

391
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,550
all and sundry to sandworm so from there

392
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:55,070
we can draw a you know dotted line link

393
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:57,829
for the purposes of this discussion to

394
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,210
unit seven four four five five and for

395
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,070
the same reason that Jason read the

396
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,530
original disclaimer word-for-word I will

397
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,940
read this word for word proceeding on

398
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,890
these explicit assumptions for the

399
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,900
purposes of this talk will operate under

400
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,270
the premise that discussed unit two six

401
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,890
one sixty five activity represents at

402
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,290
least some segment to fancy bear

403
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:17,360
activity and that discussed unit seven

404
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,160
four four five five activity represents

405
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:27,740
at least some segments of sandworm

406
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:29,719
activity welcome to my thesis so getting

407
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,670
back into how that water manifests what

408
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,960
those chaotic dynamics manifest as we'll

409
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,729
start with strategic culture this is

410
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:38,120
about as high up in influences you can

411
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:41,420
get for a very simple version Americans

412
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,520
are known for being very loud in this

413
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,260
case studies of Russian intelligence

414
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,079
operations throughout the ages have

415
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,610
given a picture of a specific culture

416
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,790
that permeates the way that they conduct

417
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,800
operations that was termed by a former

418
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,349
CIA official as the clandestine

419
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,089
mentality it's this idea dating all the

420
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,330
way back to the Bolshevik period that

421
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,830
someone is out there to get me the only

422
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,700
way that I can stop them is by engaging

423
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:09,440
in secret counteraction therefore I must

424
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,570
always be engaging in action on I must

425
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,940
always be on my toes and must be

426
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,770
emphasizing clandestinity in everything

427
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,750
that I do which goes back to Jason's

428
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,640
point that when typically in any

429
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,340
intelligence service clandestinity is a

430
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,230
major part of how they're operating but

431
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,450
here it goes to another level and that

432
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,950
it is a pervasive element of the

433
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:30,340
cultural approach to dealing with

434
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,340
threats

435
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,219
this manifests a little bit more clearly

436
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,920
in organizational cultures where you

437
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,090
then have the traditions of specific

438
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,670
organizations the histories of specific

439
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:44,440
organizations impacting and mingling

440
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,229
with that strategic culture to form an

441
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,120
organizational culture in this case the

442
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,380
researcher mark gali Adi has talked

443
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,570
about something called the wartime

444
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,160
mindset that he's described as evident

445
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:57,160
in the russian intelligence community

446
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,829
since 2011 this mindset consists of

447
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,620
three major prongs first is that Russia

448
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,450
is at some sort of existential

449
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,000
traditionally political and ideological

450
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,020
existential risk that that risk emanates

451
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,790
from the West

452
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,260
forcing Russia into a zero-sum

453
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,750
competition with the West and that

454
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,790
therefore action is always preferable

455
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:18,820
over inaction to avoid loss of an

456
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,040
advantage in the case of unit 2/6 165

457
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,690
you can actually see some of this in

458
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,760
their unit motto which is there is

459
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:28,270
always a solution

460
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,189
and with that impetus for action that

461
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,020
impetus for activity you're also dealing

462
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,850
with competition dynamics between

463
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:38,340
organizations within intelligence

464
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:40,990
communities there is a rich very

465
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:42,570
volatile history of competition between

466
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,350
Russian intelligence entities

467
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,540
particularly between the Federal

468
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,950
Security Service the FSB and the GRU

469
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,579
known for burning each other's

470
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:52,990
operations outing each other's officers

471
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:56,320
stealing information from each other I

472
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:58,390
can get very very very aggressive now

473
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,980
look I mean alex says this anytime he

474
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,420
says it and any time a researcher talks

475
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,470
about this competition between Russian

476
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,819
intelligence services

477
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,560
Soula noise wants to raise their hand

478
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,670
yeah yeah yeah but the US has that too

479
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,649
right there's US intelligence services

480
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,240
and they're competing and there's

481
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,920
constricted resources and all that sort

482
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,760
of jazz and the reality of course is

483
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,950
that's true right there's always

484
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,150
competition between a nation-states

485
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,040
intelligence services and how they

486
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,750
function with each other the difference

487
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,399
though is that at least from the United

488
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,650
States perspective that competition

489
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,600
occurs and in highly organized legal

490
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,490
framework where it involves mostly

491
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,929
lawyers and as much as the individual

492
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,520
operators and people involved want to

493
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,720
flame each other and destroy each other

494
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,160
at the end of the day we're all on the

495
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,210
same side we're now we're all working

496
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,130
towards the same objectives and we're

497
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,530
all working together to achieve a common

498
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,970
aim that same sort of feeling right that

499
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,170
universal we're all out to do that we're

500
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,510
all in this together one team one fight

501
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:46,230
is not pervasive if it exists at all

502
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,230
within the Russians

503
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:55,980
so I about leadership demands this is

504
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,660
something that can be it's it's a it's a

505
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,100
variable that also depends on the type

506
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,560
of government that a specific

507
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,000
intelligence services responding to in

508
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,980
the US for example like Jason said

509
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,050
Command Authority goes through a lot of

510
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,940
layers of structure and legality and

511
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:11,040
process before it reaches down to

512
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,980
operational and tactical levels while in

513
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,500
a place like Russia you have power

514
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,630
deeply concentrated in individuals as

515
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,150
opposed to in offices or in institutions

516
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,100
so you have leadership demands that can

517
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:26,580
manifest more directly in operational

518
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:28,530
activities a good example the in my in

519
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,120
my in my view is the fact that you can

520
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,070
look at a lot of Russian cyber activity

521
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,949
and see an element of Praetorian ISM in

522
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:38,129
it in this context Vittoria nism refers

523
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:40,620
to the idea that Putin has engaged in a

524
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,630
series of demonstrable behaviors to that

525
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,669
aim to delegitimize the ideas of

526
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:47,370
democracy and Western political

527
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,140
institutions as valid compared to the

528
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,780
political institutions that he has

529
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,970
instituted in Russia so the idea is to D

530
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:56,040
legitimate in the eyes particularly of a

531
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,990
domestic audience in an effort to

532
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,330
legitimize his own activities and

533
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,470
behaviors there's a contrast here of

534
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,820
course with the way this happens in the

535
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,930
United States and again to be fair I

536
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,980
don't we don't want to just like pick on

537
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,210
the Russians and say they do it and

538
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,070
they're bad at it because the Americans

539
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,900
have a version of this as well right but

540
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,189
again the difference is it's a legal and

541
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,690
organized sort of way we have a thing

542
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,280
called the National Intelligence

543
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,570
Priorities framework but the most boring

544
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,790
administrator term you ever have right

545
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,020
the NIP off' and the NIP if is something

546
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,340
that the president of the National

547
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,170
Security Council and like the most

548
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,850
senior levels of US national security

549
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,340
and foreign policy put together to say

550
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,659
what are the things we care about from a

551
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,699
policy perspective and we want more

552
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,220
information on so when the President or

553
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,980
the NSC says I really care about Peru

554
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,720
and I care about Peru's economy well

555
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,030
someone then at the next level down says

556
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,130
well Peru's economy is based upon grain

557
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,899
production and grain export so then as

558
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,850
that works its way down what you end up

559
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,890
with is that tactical operations

560
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,060
executed by the US military the US

561
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,730
intelligence community and other

562
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,860
elements at the very like on the ground

563
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,570
level you can draw dotted lines from

564
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,740
those operations all the way up to the

565
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,270
most senior levels of the government

566
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,890
because that nip

567
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,330
is what allows those lower levels to

568
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:02,400
answer the questions that the senior

569
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,899
level set out right think about that in

570
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,060
contrast to what Alex just explained

571
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,350
here where its powers is concentrated

572
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,639
entirely at the top and everyone just

573
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:15,449
trying to please the master right like

574
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:17,070
that she but you knew there so and then

575
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,720
this is where domestic politics comes in

576
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,820
this is something that is more pervasive

577
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,220
and kind of more predictable than just

578
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,840
related to leadership structures because

579
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,570
every country is going to have domestic

580
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,250
politics no matter how liberal or

581
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,149
conservative for lack of a better term

582
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,050
their government structures actually are

583
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,820
the case that we're looking at

584
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:38,100
particularly I want to talk about the

585
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,350
emphasis on targeting of anti-doping

586
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,560
organizations so over the last several

587
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:45,750
years leading up to twenty the sixteen

588
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,750
over the Rio 2016 Olympics there were a

589
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,830
number of exposes and reports by

590
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,780
international sports administrative

591
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,879
bodies that basically outed systematic

592
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,760
Russian doping efforts at major

593
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,710
international sporting events that's a

594
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,200
loss of international prestige it is not

595
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:03,660
a loss of international power you're not

596
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,790
losing control of territory or military

597
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,530
assets nobody's getting invaded your

598
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:11,159
economy isn't being targeted but your

599
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:13,980
pride hurts and that can cause domestic

600
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,230
political costs so your national pride

601
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,940
prestige can drive things which we like

602
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,070
to call vanity operations you're

603
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,080
engaging in operations specifically in

604
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,240
order to recover some sense of pride and

605
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,379
prestige because you're feeling vain

606
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,640
about the fact that you've got caught

607
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,800
doing something wrong or that somebody

608
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:34,560
outed something else you did there's no

609
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:36,480
other real edge to it is anybody have a

610
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,310
toddler at home because it's a lot like

611
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,560
that right like when you catch your

612
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:42,000
young child doing something wrong and

613
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,560
they get upset about that right they

614
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,910
tend to do something else in a their

615
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,990
make up for it or actually make it much

616
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,980
worse for themselves which it's really

617
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,540
hard to convince them if they shouldn't

618
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,070
do that but it's the same sort of thing

619
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,920
going on here it's a fascinating process

620
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:56,129
and and it exists in both contexts so

621
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,530
for example in these operations that

622
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:00,780
unit 261 65 engaged and where they

623
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:03,710
deployed close access teams to

624
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:06,360
compromised the networks of multiple

625
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,490
international anti-doping organizations

626
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,740
those materials were then exploited in

627
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,280
influence operations that tried to

628
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,380
portray

629
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,090
a general victimization narrative of

630
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:18,180
Russia Russia has been victimized

631
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:20,970
because they are persecuted for their

632
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:23,940
superiority or that the West can't

633
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,800
fairly compete or that it's all

634
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,450
political machinations at play and all

635
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,330
the evidence is doctored and you can see

636
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,220
in the indictment actually lays out

637
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:34,260
parallels between influence outlets

638
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,530
operated by unit seven four four five

639
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,580
five mirroring is almost exactly the

640
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:41,100
talking points of senior government

641
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,290
Russian officials in a relatively close

642
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,820
timeframe and let's just talk about

643
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,050
those close access operations for one

644
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,450
second right so these are operations

645
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:50,070
where intelligence officers are going

646
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,200
overseas right likely under some sort of

647
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,189
cover with documentation to prove they

648
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,900
are who they say they are when they're

649
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,580
actually not that person right so they

650
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,740
go overseas undercover with

651
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,909
documentation they have technical gear

652
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,560
that they use to execute these

653
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,940
operations right they have Wi-Fi gear

654
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,980
they have all sorts of interesting

655
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,570
gizmos and gadgets like out of Inspector

656
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,460
Gadget or James Bond all this sort of

657
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,290
stuff scrolled away in their backpacks

658
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,940
and hidden in secret compartments they

659
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,320
have specially designed cars that they

660
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,460
use to do this stuff they have all these

661
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,810
tactics they use to avoid detection

662
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,330
while they're walking around the city

663
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:20,730
all these things happen when they get

664
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,260
caught it has a massive cost on the

665
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,450
after that just got caught right all

666
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,980
this stuff that they used is now exposed

667
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,320
they can't use it anymore develop new

668
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,000
tactics people can't travel documents

669
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,220
get burned aliases get burned all this

670
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,750
bad stuff happens and to do all of that

671
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,580
and risk all of that for it is

672
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,820
essentially a vanity operation it seems

673
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,919
utterly insane and again we don't want

674
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,800
to just talk about only Russia there's a

675
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:46,020
recent US example of this as well back

676
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,540
in November of 2018 there was discussion

677
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,850
about how US Cybercom conducted an

678
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,139
offensive operation it was described in

679
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:56,010
the press and also by US government

680
00:23:52,140 --> 00:24:00,060
officials targeting the internet

681
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:03,480
research Association agency agency yes I

682
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:04,740
always confused the two IRAs where it

683
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,360
became an issue where they were

684
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,610
describing that they had disrupted the

685
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,469
IRA in engaging in what could have

686
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:12,479
potentially been actions to influence

687
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:15,780
the outcome of the u.s. elections in

688
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,940
2018 to a lot of people in the general

689
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,710
public this seemed like a big win oh the

690
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,020
US is doing something against Russia

691
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,700
especially in our domestic political

692
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,549
environment being able to for the White

693
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,169
House to be seen

694
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:29,200
a hard stance against Russia is a

695
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:31,419
politically valuable point but if you

696
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,700
you know went one level down to you know

697
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:35,889
security commentators technology

698
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,419
commentators from what was described it

699
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:41,439
sound like maybe they turned off a land

700
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:43,659
for a couple of hours and that's not a

701
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,729
real effect in terms of the long scheme

702
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:47,409
of things when you're conducting

703
00:24:44,729 --> 00:24:48,700
nation-state influence operations if you

704
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:50,769
have an outlet like the internet

705
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,200
research agency its main job is to build

706
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:55,599
up narratives over a very long period of

707
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,489
time insert those narratives into

708
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,579
foreign political discourse and then

709
00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:04,570
watch them create fractures and fissures

710
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:06,609
how is turning off their land at the end

711
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,799
of what would be their operational cycle

712
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:10,359
at all going to really impact something

713
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,839
beyond scoring you domestic political

714
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:16,329
points when it reaches the press so

715
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:18,158
there are this can manifest in a lot of

716
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:19,570
different ways it's not just one way or

717
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,979
the other and it can even manifest at

718
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,989
lower levels you know national pride and

719
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:24,579
prestige is one thing you know being

720
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:31,149
able to demonstrate taking other kinds

721
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:33,339
of political stances is another so the

722
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:35,289
actual genesis for this talk is this

723
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:36,940
hang on tight thinking or methodology

724
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:38,259
and there is something that happened a

725
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,789
couple months back and alex and i were

726
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:41,559
talking about how crazy this thing was

727
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:43,629
and we started talking with this concept

728
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,158
that the lower level officers the ones

729
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:46,629
on the ground executing their guys in

730
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:47,649
the close access operations running

731
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,329
around with the backpack

732
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:50,889
they had this sense of hang on tight

733
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:52,899
thinking because they're on a train that

734
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:55,178
is barely on the track right it is

735
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:58,178
barreling down a track going very very

736
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:59,349
fast extremely wobbly possibly gonna go

737
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:01,209
off the track at any minute but they're

738
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,349
just trying to hold on while still doing

739
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:03,849
their jobs right cuz they have to do the

740
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:05,559
things they're told to do go execute the

741
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:07,329
operations get on keyboard do the thing

742
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:10,239
right they have to execute their job but

743
00:26:07,329 --> 00:26:11,440
they have to have this sense of what is

744
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:13,029
actually happening and how's this

745
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,379
influenced what I'm doing and it

746
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,089
influences it in a couple of ways it

747
00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:17,379
influences it and the planning and the

748
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:19,570
timing of the plans that you're going to

749
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:21,609
execute do you spend the amount of time

750
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,928
you really want to planning to the right

751
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:24,158
extent the operations that you're gonna

752
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:25,539
run where you don't want to get caught

753
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,489
right where the calculus is really high

754
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:28,899
do you spend the amount of time you

755
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:31,149
really want to in the execution of that

756
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:32,379
operation to really make sure all the

757
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:34,539
T's are crossed all the I's are dotted

758
00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:35,559
all the things are done the right way to

759
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,470
make sure that it goes well and you

760
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,420
don't get caught

761
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,310
in any of the post-op or follow-on

762
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,230
activity yes it's done great check the

763
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,520
box but that's it right like just move

764
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,990
on to the next thing because we have so

765
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,150
many other things stacked up to do next

766
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:48,710
and then finally in the aftermath of a

767
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:50,360
compromise if you fail and you get

768
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,760
caught and then potentially attributed

769
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,889
how do you respond to that when you have

770
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,270
this hang on type thinking where I just

771
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,400
got to do anything I can do to get from

772
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:00,050
one day to the next because everything

773
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,610
above me is pure chaos right and I don't

774
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,350
really know what to do other than just

775
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:05,270
keep doing my job to the best level that

776
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:07,969
I can without getting myself fired or in

777
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:10,220
some cases killed this impacts a lot of

778
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:12,050
different things including operational

779
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,210
decisions and a good example of this is

780
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,889
where you know the the operations

781
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,240
manager goes into the room with the

782
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,040
management and says I want to do this

783
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,340
operation I'm going to use a particular

784
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,379
tool drunk koala I want to deploy the

785
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,600
drunk koala implant on this particular

786
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,010
target that's fantastic right but then

787
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,659
the management looks at that and says

788
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,030
well we don't really want you to do that

789
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,980
we want you to deploy a super short

790
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,360
giraffe instead right but that's not the

791
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,340
right tool for the operation but there's

792
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,600
some political something going on at

793
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,669
some higher level that the operator

794
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,260
doesn't know about that impacts the way

795
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,820
the decision gets made and instead of

796
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,170
using the tool that's right for the

797
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,460
operation they end up being forced to

798
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:49,790
use a tool that's not right for the

799
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,870
operation this is a common outplay of

800
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,820
what happens when you had that sort of

801
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,800
chaos at those higher levels that chaos

802
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,120
filters all that's way down down to the

803
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,110
level of which I'm choosing what tools I

804
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,370
want to use in my particular operation

805
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:04,189
so now that we've laid out this whole

806
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,570
structure of how this chaos exists and

807
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,280
what it can look like let's talk about

808
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:10,550
how it actually has manifested in our

809
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,590
case studies so we have three here the

810
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,149
first I'll just go chronologically we

811
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,449
have the the Russian interference in the

812
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:19,700
2016 election so the this is the July

813
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:21,920
2018 indictment this described unit two

814
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,640
six one six five is engaging in a

815
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:27,230
sustained very long very persistent

816
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,080
campaign to gain remote access to a

817
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:32,030
number of US political institutions and

818
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,220
then it's distribute the materials

819
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:37,100
stolen from that for influencer purposes

820
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,900
the biggest thing you see here is the

821
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,020
targets like the Democratic National

822
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:44,570
Committee the Democratic Congressional

823
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:47,360
Campaign Committee all of these things

824
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:48,530
are high-value targets from an

825
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,580
intelligence services perspective

826
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,940
they're there

827
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:56,330
if you get caught there it's a big deal

828
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:58,279
and so you had fancy bear this is what

829
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,869
the two six one six five activity is

830
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:02,299
really connected to per the indictment

831
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:05,029
present in the DN c--'s networks for a

832
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:06,408
big portion of 2016 but at the same time

833
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:09,139
it later came out that there was a

834
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:11,330
second bear in the DN c--'s networks

835
00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:14,840
cosy bear also referred to as apt twenty

836
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:17,090
nine now you would assume where you have

837
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,309
the potential loss of clandestinity the

838
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,959
potential loss of tools the potential

839
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:23,559
for attribution the potential for loss

840
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,359
of mission success that there would be a

841
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:29,539
detailed thorough structure to

842
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:31,730
deconflict operations in order to meet

843
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:34,489
the goal associated with sending a team

844
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,909
to target those entities in the first

845
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:37,609
place

846
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:39,950
clearly that didn't exist because as was

847
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:43,428
also covered in press reporting and in

848
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:45,230
blogs and all over Twitter once fancy

849
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:46,609
bear got kicked out cozy bear got kicked

850
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,220
out too and they had been there for

851
00:29:46,609 --> 00:29:51,320
longer so it was a another operational

852
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,359
dividend cost where potentially multiple

853
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,220
intelligence services were losing

854
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,340
operations because they weren't d

855
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,830
conflicting and that deconfliction is

856
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,389
something that you see formalized in a

857
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:04,519
lot of other services in a lot of other

858
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:05,748
communities and it's absence here

859
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,269
signals that there must have clearly

860
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:10,999
been some sort of impetus to cause to

861
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:12,499
separate actor groups to target the same

862
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:15,470
entities in the same period of time

863
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:19,070
while ignoring essentially the potential

864
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:21,850
risks involved then we go on to the GRU

865
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:24,769
hacking to undermine anti-doping efforts

866
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:27,709
this ties back into the discussion of

867
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:29,149
vanity operations domestic politics and

868
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,190
the really risks of closed access

869
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:34,539
operations there were numerous closed

870
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:37,489
access operations described in detail

871
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:39,200
and as somebody who has studied this

872
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:40,850
kind of activity for a long time it was

873
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,279
it was stunning for me to read an

874
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:46,609
indictment that laid out close access

875
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,960
operations so thoroughly I don't know

876
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:49,879
the sources that they were able to

877
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,049
procure in that indictment but clearly

878
00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:55,248
those operations had been very

879
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:57,499
thoroughly burned but again you usually

880
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:59,389
engage in remote access in closed access

881
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:01,369
operations when the remote options have

882
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:03,409
been exhausted as Jason has described

883
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:05,240
the idea that they went all

884
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:07,810
way to the wall of choosing closed

885
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,190
access operations on multiple occasions

886
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:12,860
reusing personnel in some cases even

887
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:15,140
reusing laptops that still had

888
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:17,360
information from old operations on them

889
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:20,630
to target these entities over and over

890
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:24,199
again signals again that the desire for

891
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:25,970
a result was very very very high and

892
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,400
despite the fact that there was a

893
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,900
significant amount of risk involved

894
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,670
there was still the decision to

895
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,610
undertake operations using those tactics

896
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:36,680
techniques and procedures I think it's

897
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:38,600
important to note that the implication

898
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,100
should not be that these actors aren't

899
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,780
sophisticated right that late well they

900
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,949
use the they reuse the laptop so the

901
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,649
same information on them the same

902
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:47,390
tooling that's not because they didn't

903
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:50,480
know better right these are highly

904
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:51,620
professional long-standing they know

905
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,030
what they're doing right these services

906
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,500
are competent in what they're out there

907
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,840
to do when they're good when they do it

908
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,760
so the fact that these compromises were

909
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,110
made for some reason right like it it

910
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,550
lends credence to what alex is saying

911
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:03,679
here that there's no reason no

912
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,149
foreseeable operational reason why you

913
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,860
would make those operational compromises

914
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,780
when this is the logical result but not

915
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:10,340
only do you get caught but it exposes

916
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,870
this operation the way you did it the

917
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,639
tools you use the people involved and

918
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:16,429
historical operations that are then tied

919
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,020
to it and then you have our last case

920
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:19,820
here which is the close access

921
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,680
operations that were publicized by the

922
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,270
British and Dutch governments targeting

923
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,730
entities related to chemical weapons

924
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:27,560
analysis these this material was

925
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:30,940
released at the same time as the October

926
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:32,120
2018 indictments but also included a

927
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,320
stunning

928
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,530
I feel stunning as the right word

929
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:39,850
PowerPoint deck describing in detail how

930
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:43,629
a GRU closed access team was tracked and

931
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:46,730
disrupted trying to target the

932
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:50,540
Organization for the Prevention of

933
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:52,340
chemical weapons in The Hague this is a

934
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,220
kind of operation where it makes more

935
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:57,050
sense from a kind of grand scheme and

936
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,180
even from like a tactical perspective to

937
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:01,879
use a closed access operation to target

938
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,980
a hardened entity that was related to

939
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,080
ongoing political affairs that could

940
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,400
incur significant costs in terms of

941
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,889
sanctions and diplomatic consequences

942
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,660
for Russia in relationship to the

943
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:15,620
attempted assassination of Sergey score

944
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:16,760
Paul in March of 2018 but you can draw a

945
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:19,280
line from the

946
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,650
promis-- of close access operations

947
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,980
related to the anti-doping efforts to

948
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:28,040
the compromise of the operation against

949
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:31,460
OPCW because some operators were reused

950
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:35,990
techniques were reused physical tech was

951
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:38,000
reused so by being willing to have to

952
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:40,670
not even by being willing by having to

953
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,550
engage in high-risk operational

954
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:45,850
decisions in service of vanity

955
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,960
objectives you put future objectives

956
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,909
future operations against real

957
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,460
objectives at greater risk of loss of

958
00:33:49,910 --> 00:34:00,980
compromised loss of success attribution

959
00:33:52,460 --> 00:34:02,750
and so on so why does all of this matter

960
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,640
we've been going on or what could be a

961
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,920
very really interesting master's thesis

962
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,380
about the dynamics inside intelligence

963
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,850
organizations which I know I'm prone and

964
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,020
I know these multiple people in this all

965
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:14,960
need to know I'm prone to ramble on

966
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,480
about but at the same time there is

967
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,909
value in the holistic understanding of

968
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,250
what goes into adversary behavior that

969
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,780
is if you're in a situation where these

970
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,610
types of actors are in your threat

971
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,379
profile and there's something that

972
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,179
you're confronting on a regular basis or

973
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:31,310
even on a basis where they're going to

974
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:34,970
be your edge case but it's a very severe

975
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:37,100
edge case a deeper comprehension of

976
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:39,080
those drivers can help you defend

977
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,839
smarter emulate smarter and overall

978
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,460
manage risk better I spend a fair amount

979
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,649
of time helping a variety of different

980
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,470
types of enterprises build a detection

981
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:50,029
engineering regime right not necessarily

982
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:51,918
what tool in what place but how to think

983
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,419
about what your threat actors do how the

984
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,739
nature of what they do affects what's

985
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:56,509
gonna happen to your network and then

986
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:57,859
how do you build a system to detect

987
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,000
those things and then once you detect

988
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,740
them which is only the first part of the

989
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,180
battle actually understand what that is

990
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,220
and what it means that you detected it

991
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,720
in the first place in the case of

992
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,430
understanding not only who did the

993
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,049
operation out the attribution but the

994
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:11,330
nature of the actor who did it how they

995
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,440
think how they apply their methodology

996
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,870
and what they actually end up doing

997
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,890
operationally helps you take the facets

998
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,240
that you learn that detection

999
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:19,160
engineering and ideally spread it across

1000
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,080
your enterprise so it's not saying that

1001
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,430
I know that this particular actor has

1002
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,080
access to this particular exploit

1003
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:26,839
therefore I will make sure that my edge

1004
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,980
defenses are bounded and done in such a

1005
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,960
way to make sure I can protect against

1006
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,220
that that exploit right that's not

1007
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,589
done a good strategic decision that's a

1008
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:35,540
very tactical one how do you extract the

1009
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:37,040
value out of that attribution and

1010
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,200
understanding of your adversary and

1011
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,240
spread the value across your detection

1012
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,710
regime in addition you can work to

1013
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,569
enhance the fidelity of your emulation

1014
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:46,550
activities and I liked in our keynote

1015
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,440
today where you talked about you know

1016
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:50,869
not restricting your red team to say you

1017
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,490
are aptX and only do that and said give

1018
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:53,780
them give them latitude right let them

1019
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:55,779
be the artist that they want to be in

1020
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:58,580
designing their red team behavior as

1021
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,339
part of that let's expand it even wider

1022
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,660
right so for example we can we can pen

1023
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:03,650
test and red team the internal network

1024
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,270
all day long

1025
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,530
but is anybody thinking about the fact

1026
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,359
that the Wi-Fi that you use in your

1027
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,040
office is powerful enough right the APS

1028
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:12,020
APS you're using you're powerful enough

1029
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,060
that that Wi-Fi signal is seen at

1030
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,589
relatively decent strength three blocks

1031
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,820
down the road at a cafe where someone

1032
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:18,140
could be sitting with a laptop and

1033
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,119
potentially interacting with your

1034
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:22,129
network unbeknownst to you right there

1035
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:24,260
are these closed access considerations

1036
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:25,790
where what is your adversary capable of

1037
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,260
and/or willing to do with it how do you

1038
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:30,859
build that into those emulation

1039
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,270
activities and at the same time even

1040
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:34,069
along the lines of threat hunting which

1041
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:35,599
is a place where I often see a lot of

1042
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:38,300
interaction between red and blue teamers

1043
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,880
and exchanging tactics and general thé

1044
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:43,070
where the discourse can be strongest if

1045
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,330
you're you know engaging in an operation

1046
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,859
as a red teamer

1047
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:48,619
or even as a blue chamber where you're

1048
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:50,420
concerned about somebody like fancy bear

1049
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:51,920
what kind of data is fancy bear going to

1050
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,780
be looking for now that you're aware

1051
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,060
that they can be motivated by things

1052
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,460
like vanity you know it could be

1053
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:01,279
valuable looking at an anti-doping

1054
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,630
institution for example there's multiple

1055
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,220
data sets within an anti-doping

1056
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,480
institution that could be of value to

1057
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,009
the Russian government and not

1058
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,109
necessarily all of them related to

1059
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,730
Russian or foreign athletes a lot of it

1060
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:12,740
could be related to relationships that

1061
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:14,630
those entities have to in other

1062
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:17,868
international governance bodies but if

1063
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:20,720
you know X Y Z current events could be

1064
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:22,460
driving particularly wounds of pride and

1065
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,680
prestige it might be worth simulating

1066
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,599
looking at where you know maybe there's

1067
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,460
been malicious activity here maybe it's

1068
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:35,089
worth simulating malicious activity here

1069
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:37,880
in those cases so where do we go from

1070
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:39,230
here I was always a fan of presentations

1071
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,700
I got up and said a bunch of things and

1072
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:42,380
said well what's the next logical step

1073
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,029
from this right not only what do you get

1074
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,670
either but what can

1075
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:46,900
we do from here so one is what is the

1076
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,340
overall influence of governments

1077
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,750
ideology all the way down to the

1078
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,280
execution of these technical and cyber

1079
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,200
operations well we talked about Russia a

1080
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,790
lot here you can think of other actors

1081
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,500
where you apply the same methodology the

1082
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:58,420
Iranians are a potentially good example

1083
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,950
where in the sort of Iranian theocracy

1084
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,690
you have this concept of exporting the

1085
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:03,339
revolution well if you have that at the

1086
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,930
highest levels of the Iranian government

1087
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,700
if you bring that all the way down to

1088
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:07,810
the lower levels how does exporting the

1089
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,730
revolution and everything that that

1090
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,230
means applying the intelligence

1091
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:14,500
operations context and in the cyber

1092
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:16,360
operations context in addition how do

1093
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,830
pseudo and non-governmental interests

1094
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,890
also affect these sorts of things so for

1095
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:22,779
example NGOs think tanks contractors

1096
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,339
criminal organizations how do the way

1097
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,960
those organizations act and think and

1098
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,520
operate affect the way that these same

1099
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,440
operations will be executed and then how

1100
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,670
do you drive value from that into your

1101
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,460
own detection regime and on a broader

1102
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:38,260
basic level you can basically take that

1103
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,330
his you know the academic function of

1104
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:42,760
intelligence studies which has gotten to

1105
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:44,470
be stronger and broader part of the

1106
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,870
academic field over the last couple of

1107
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,279
years and start applying it to the

1108
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:50,529
internal dynamics of the relevant

1109
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,880
entities so a lot of times intelligence

1110
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,920
studies and you know histories of

1111
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:57,120
intelligence organizations focus on big

1112
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,350
things counterintelligence failures

1113
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:02,950
penetrations historical deception

1114
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:05,110
operations wartime operations but if you

1115
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,299
start looking and those resources and

1116
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:09,010
those research structures and saying

1117
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:11,530
let's take the lessons that we can learn

1118
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,900
about how an entity thinks who that

1119
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:15,940
entity responds to what has typically

1120
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,040
been a big driver or not for that entity

1121
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:20,200
and start applying it to potential

1122
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,640
future cyber operations you can glean a

1123
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,569
lot of the kinds of insights that we

1124
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:27,549
talked about today and with that we

1125
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:29,020
intentionally left a few minutes so that

1126
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:31,030
we could answer any questions you have

1127
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:34,000
thank you very much

1128
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:36,060
[Applause]

1129
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,060
you
