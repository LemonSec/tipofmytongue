1
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,230
and thanks for all the help getting this

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,190
set up sorry for the inconvenience so

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,530
techniques and tools for becoming an

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,600
intelligence operator I'm just to

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,550
clarify the title this is not how to get

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,500
into the military and do this or two

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,440
into any particular agency this is

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,300
really just a focus on over the last

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,740
year what trace Labs is done and learned

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,540
from all the different people doing

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,519
intelligence for the organization and

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,570
then how you can apply it and use the

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,580
techniques yourself so a little outline

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,140
of what I'll be going over today or in

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,370
this hour I always like to know when I

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,690
go into a talk what am I going to get

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,640
out of this what's it going to look like

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,660
for the next little bit this is what it

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,160
is I'm not going to go through every

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,709
bullet point there but that's what you

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,260
got to look forward to a little bit

22
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,120
about myself so I've been working in IT

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,099
for about twenty years most of that's

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,660
been security I actually know what this

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,970
is I have a whole box of them in my

26
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,099
garage somewhere and I remember those

27
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,700
days I started off with like a 14-4

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,520
modem um yeah yeah someone else

29
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,990
remembers those days yeah so it's been

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,520
really interesting the journey to see

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,139
how much we've done in the world of

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,020
security since then right we went from

33
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:17,850
basically none to a lot and very

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,048
sophisticated at this point right so

35
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,109
it's been really interesting to watch

36
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,060
that progress so that's my day job I

37
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:25,619
also am a volunteer in Coquitlam search

38
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,859
and rescue been doing that for about 10

39
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,389
years I focus on tracking and a few

40
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,759
other disciplines in that area and the

41
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:34,199
reason why that's relevant is because

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,729
we're gonna talk about open source

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,340
intelligence and intelligence

44
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,439
intelligence gathering and as a tracker

45
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,999
it's really similar so I'll be drawn

46
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,490
those similarities as we progress

47
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:46,560
through this presentation I'm also the

48
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,270
founder of trace lab so I'll talk about

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,999
that a little bit a lot of the material

50
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,560
from this in this presentation is from

51
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:54,479
what a lot of our members have done over

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,429
the last year and if you'd like to

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,359
contact me that's my Twitter and my

54
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:02,849
email address so the standard disclaimer

55
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,919
I'm very opinionated I say a lot of

56
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:06,499
things and they're all just my opinions

57
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:09,179
they don't reflect any company or

58
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:12,629
affiliation that I've had have now or

59
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,630
will have in the future all right so

60
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,790
what's trace labs trace labs was an

61
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,400
I had over a year ago I have a lot of

62
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,489
dumb ideas this one really seemed to

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,260
take off it's a nonprofit organization

64
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:28,440
that's designed to help locate missing

65
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,959
persons having spent ten years in SAR I

66
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,570
research for a lot of missing persons

67
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,370
but a lot of people we don't look for

68
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,750
the assumption by the law enforcement is

69
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,660
that those people are gonna come home

70
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,250
statistically speaking most people do I

71
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,350
was really looking at the ones that

72
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,360
don't and that's what this is designed

73
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,820
to help so we provide a modern

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,550
cost-effective and transparent solution

75
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,700
to what I see as a growing problem we

76
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,200
produce we focus on crowdsourcing open

77
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,810
source intelligence through large

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,929
organized events so what we typically do

79
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,940
is a OSINT CTF at a conference that was

80
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,980
really our bread and butter over the

81
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,740
last year we're now branching off to do

82
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,690
these sort of events in schools so last

83
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,020
month we were at South Wales University

84
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,210
in England where we did an event and we

85
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,090
typically look for eight real missing

86
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,830
people within that locale so within that

87
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,320
community if we can't find them in the

88
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:26,340
community we just keep broadening that

89
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,500
radius from city to state or province to

90
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,970
country until we locate those eight

91
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,520
missing people and so there's our oh

92
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,190
those are real missing people it's not

93
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,380
theoretical so what we offer is a non

94
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,350
theoretical type CTF which is really

95
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,079
attractive for a lot of people and so

96
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,430
these are real people real world people

97
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,720
and we have to be very careful how we

98
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,000
proceed with that we do a lot of

99
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,340
different events we used to do one event

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,050
a month now it's multiple events per

101
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,420
month we're doing two events in the same

102
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,970
day coming up pretty soon we've done a

103
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,260
lot of b-sides Def Con SEC talks and

104
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:02,730
Australia both on-site and virtual we've

105
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,120
got a bunch of big events coming up with

106
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,679
layer 8 in the US besides Vegas and

107
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,850
we're just going to announce next week a

108
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,950
couple really big events that we're

109
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,530
gonna do and that just haven't come out

110
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,769
yet so stand by for that so it's it's

111
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,620
drawing the model came from an idea and

112
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,690
it's taken off and you know this whole

113
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,140
crowdsourcing open open source

114
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,100
intelligence has really caught on and

115
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:29,610
we're going to talk about how to apply

116
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,409
that in other industries as well so

117
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,330
questions I often get asked you know

118
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:34,710
around you know who are you looking for

119
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,349
I break it down into three main

120
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,280
categories people that are hiding they

121
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:40,349
don't want to be found

122
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,568
those are typically people that want to

123
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:43,710
start their life new and you could say

124
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:45,659
well Rob why are you looking for those

125
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,340
people why you bugging them well usually

126
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:49,469
it's because they they want to get away

127
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,448
from some obligations so the police want

128
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:53,939
to talk to them that could be child

129
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,650
support and things like that also people

130
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:57,629
that are being hidden so that's human

131
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,830
trafficking and then people that don't

132
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:00,870
even know they're missing so that's

133
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:04,378
child abductions so there's a sort of

134
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,060
the three main areas we focus on we

135
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,029
don't just look for anybody

136
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,590
law enforcement actually has to post on

137
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:13,680
the internet something to the effect

138
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,929
we're seeking the public's support to

139
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,879
find this person that's really our

140
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,449
calling card and our invitation to go

141
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:24,479
look for that person our scope is really

142
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:25,620
limited and that's by design we don't

143
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,139
want to interfere with any criminal

144
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,779
investigations so we do passive

145
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,389
reconnaissance no interaction no

146
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:36,509
friending no light keen no commenting no

147
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:38,339
swiping right we don't follow up with

148
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:40,250
anybody we don't want to interfere at

149
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,900
all all we do is collect intelligence

150
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,400
package it up really nice and then give

151
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,258
that to law enforcement and then we move

152
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,580
on to the next event a lot of people ask

153
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,680
us well how many people have you found

154
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,050
well we do locate people but we don't

155
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,699
really track that because we don't get

156
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,469
involved we just give the intelligence

157
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:59,159
and then we walk away and go to the next

158
00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:01,919
event so now I'm gonna get into actual

159
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:03,870
stuff techniques the first thing I want

160
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,878
to do is talk about your OPSEC and when

161
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,289
you're doing this sort of work that's

162
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,229
the first thing I like to talk about

163
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,419
because for us and for for other people

164
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:15,270
in this industry we're looking quite

165
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:17,400
often at bad people and you know bad

166
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,659
people probably don't get as excited as

167
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,948
you do about what you're doing

168
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:21,688
especially if you're using that

169
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:23,789
information to provide to law

170
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:25,469
enforcement so if you're getting into

171
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:27,960
this you kind of want to be very aware

172
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:29,370
of that are these people gonna find out

173
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,750
that you're doing this and then come

174
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,810
burn your house down right I mean that's

175
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:36,680
bad so I've heard a lot of stories where

176
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:40,620
this has actually gone in a bad way so

177
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,820
really important to think about that as

178
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,830
you prepare

179
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,840
to do your intelligence gathering these

180
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,190
are a list of basic questions that you

181
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,380
should ask I think there's a bunch more

182
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,360
that you probably want to go through but

183
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,190
you know think about you know why am I

184
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,230
doing this in the first place did my

185
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,219
friend down the road asked me to check

186
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,230
out somebody they're thinking about

187
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,750
renting their apartment to or is this a

188
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,670
formal engagement that where they're

189
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,870
expecting a written report that's gonna

190
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,670
be organized very nicely that I'm

191
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,290
getting paid for so you know I really

192
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,880
need to get the scope of what you're

193
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,070
doing what's the worst that could happen

194
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,630
so I spoke about that a little bit right

195
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,190
I want to be very careful how you

196
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,600
proceed

197
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,890
how are you preserving your Intel so

198
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,930
there's a lot of great tools out there

199
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,789
that I would highly recommend Huntley is

200
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,350
one of them right are you gonna go to

201
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,570
court with this information or the

202
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,360
police gonna ask you for it you know how

203
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:31,150
are you preserving that information how

204
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,040
are you categorizing it you know what

205
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,409
sort of data points are you looking for

206
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,020
all that's important how will your

207
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,820
report be consumed so if you have a

208
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,440
hundred page report and no executive

209
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,120
summary I don't think people are gonna

210
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,920
read it so that's really important to

211
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,610
think about you can have the greatest

212
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:51,280
intelligence but if it's not consumable

213
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,810
how great really is it what are your

214
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,239
objectives right what do you want to get

215
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:57,220
out of your operation and then that

216
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,570
follows into what has done look like so

217
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,210
a lot of people will spin their wheels

218
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,790
and they'll collect a ton of information

219
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,890
which is fine I guess if you've got lots

220
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,260
of time but we're really looking at what

221
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,849
are you trying to achieve here and then

222
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,039
you know how long do you have do you

223
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,960
have a month a week a day and that's

224
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,160
really gonna define what you're gonna be

225
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,229
able to produce and then who you gonna

226
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,330
share it with what's that look like is

227
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,940
it gonna go on a USB Drive can you email

228
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,120
it you know so some of the questions you

229
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,580
need to ask before you start technical

230
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,950
setup so this is just the basics

231
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,270
everybody will have a different view on

232
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,490
this but these are some of the things

233
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,309
that I would initially look at I prefer

234
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:39,190
a VM that I can archive after each

235
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:41,469
operation I use VirtualBox it's free

236
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,790
easy to set up if you've got a Mac you

237
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,640
might want to use fusion or parallels

238
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:48,160
your platform a lot of us use Kali Linux

239
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,439
that's what I would prefer but you

240
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,870
cannot of people run Windows to set up

241
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,460
your apps ranked at multi go recon in GE

242
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,560
all set up get it installed and

243
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,060
configured get that as part of your snap

244
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,410
so you can just reuse it every time you

245
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,810
don't have to worry about reconfiguring

246
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,269
it or each time get your admin apps of

247
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,979
course setup right so you can do

248
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:07,209
screenshots really easily punch

249
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,910
excuse me hunch Lee I'm a big fan of

250
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:11,410
that get your plugins set up as well so

251
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,959
this is something people overlook a lot

252
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:16,660
and then get your account set up as well

253
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:18,339
for your social media I don't use a lot

254
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,839
of fake accounts so but if you're gonna

255
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:21,790
use those you want to set those up well

256
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,889
in advance you can do things with

257
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,029
LinkedIn so on LinkedIn I have it set so

258
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:26,769
you can't see when I look at your

259
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,269
profile of course I can't see when you

260
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:30,459
look at mine but I don't care so that's

261
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:32,649
okay and then of course you want to

262
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:36,040
setup your VPN so if you're if you're

263
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:38,800
doing reconnaissance with more of a

264
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,719
risky area VPN definitely recommended so

265
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,180
this is kind of your base once you've

266
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,829
got it set up it's reusable so it's a

267
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,969
little bit of work upfront but down the

268
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:49,239
road it's really gonna save you a lot of

269
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,980
headaches so then you start to get into

270
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,870
Targ acquisition and this is really

271
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:57,370
going to depend on what type of target

272
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:59,319
you have but but some of these you can

273
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,279
apply across the board so one of the

274
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:03,219
things you want to start thinking about

275
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:05,889
right away is unique identifiers how am

276
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,990
I going to identify this target in SAR

277
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:10,089
we call them subjects so as a tracker

278
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,189
what I would be looking at is stuff

279
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:13,779
about their feet so what kind of shoe

280
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:15,730
size do they have what's their tread

281
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,410
look like for you you probably want to

282
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,230
look at you know maybe name phone number

283
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,939
email address anything like that that's

284
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,759
going to allow me to identify that

285
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:27,219
person company or whatever that target

286
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,809
is surprisingly enough most of the

287
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,000
information I get is usually not spelled

288
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:32,680
correctly so if you don't check that you

289
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,910
started off down the road it's like yeah

290
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,620
that's not actually not the person

291
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,920
because the I was supposed to be an e

292
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,329
you know very irritating friends or

293
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,009
family so if I need a little information

294
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:45,250
on that that's gonna get me start a

295
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:47,199
little bit faster special circumstance

296
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,970
or situations so why am I looking for

297
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:50,559
this person usually I say person because

298
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,839
usually for us and trace lab data it is

299
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,759
a person but it could be a company so

300
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,920
what's triggered this investigation is

301
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:58,990
that an insurance fraud is it a criminal

302
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,420
activity investigation like why am i

303
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,879
doing this the details around that is

304
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,189
going to help you stationary or mobile

305
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:08,540
so is this person on the move a lot or

306
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:11,329
do they just kind of reside in that town

307
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,699
that's gonna help me select what tools I

308
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:16,220
want to use and of course lifestyle so

309
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,020
you know if they're doing drugs or if

310
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,760
they're a criminal or even clubs

311
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,280
anything like that it's gonna help me as

312
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,990
well that's gonna narrow my scope

313
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,760
geography and mobility so do they you

314
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,640
know do they reside in a certain area or

315
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,100
highly mobile as well that's gonna

316
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,020
change things description anything like

317
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,350
that the part that stands out here are

318
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,630
scars tattoos piercing those are really

319
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,390
helpful because when I'm doing it image

320
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,670
analysis or facial rec or something like

321
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,530
that a lot of times you'll get the

322
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,390
person with the same name the picture

323
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,740
looks really similar similar so it's

324
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,500
like yeah that's the guy or that's the

325
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,630
girl and it's not so if I can pick out

326
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,070
something very unique like a pure scene

327
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,310
or anything like that that's gonna help

328
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:00,320
a lot sophistication level that's stuff

329
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,969
that I always want to be aware of are

330
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,240
they gonna know you're looking for them

331
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:07,400
and if so what's that gonna look like

332
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,790
are they aware of the situation what's

333
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,590
your risk level so are they gonna set up

334
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,930
things to be able to alert them that

335
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:17,270
you're looking are they gonna be able to

336
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,859
hide very easily that sort of stuff so

337
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,620
that those are sort of the things I work

338
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,840
through we see our members work through

339
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,640
that sort of stuff usually there are

340
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,560
members that come in at race labs there

341
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,569
they're typically some of them are very

342
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,060
new to OSINT and intelligence-gathering

343
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,440
so they get stuck fairly quickly these

344
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,449
are some of the things I talked to them

345
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,340
about to keep them going you know

346
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,750
instead of looking at your target look

347
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,720
at things that are peripheral around

348
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,280
your target in tracking we do that - we

349
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,980
don't look for the subject we look for

350
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,790
what we call sign so friends and family

351
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,320
are perfect

352
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:52,010
for missing people we get a lot of

353
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,080
chatter around the activity so that's

354
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,580
great so you'll look for those social

355
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,140
butterflies that are producing the most

356
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:00,050
amount of content and that will usually

357
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,400
take us down a path abandon accounts are

358
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,199
really good to look at because not

359
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,180
because they're their accounts but I

360
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,150
look for the patterns things like user

361
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,459
names what kind of platforms they prefer

362
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,000
as far as social media that's sort of

363
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,370
stuff

364
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,190
criminal records I don't know if those

365
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,770
are publicly available here in Canada I

366
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,300
can find your criminal record and I

367
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,800
really like those because it'll show me

368
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,839
not only what kind of

369
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,099
you've committed but also your aliases

370
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,680
that you like to use and those are

371
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,839
usually linked to social media accounts

372
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,380
and that makes my job so much easier to

373
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,269
find those school records and photos so

374
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,490
if I can find a photo of you anywhere

375
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:39,260
that's gonna be a bonus and I can use a

376
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:43,700
bunch of apps to help me find you that

377
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:45,380
way past employees employers usually on

378
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,970
employee websites or employer websites

379
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,640
rather sometimes there's pictures and

380
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,350
profiles of people that's golden sports

381
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,529
teams either playing or maybe you're

382
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,970
betting on them gym memberships

383
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:57,950
fantastic as well anywhere that you

384
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,930
could leave a trace as far as on a forum

385
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,089
so Amazon accounts are very popular

386
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:04,819
Strava so we all have these watches a

387
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:06,140
lot of us do anyway right it's uploading

388
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,820
content to the internet a lot of those

389
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,250
were very open only recently they became

390
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,870
a little more private any sort of video

391
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,610
games so if I detect you especially if

392
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,350
you're a younger person and you're

393
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,180
playing video games I can get on Steam

394
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,490
or any other sort of forum where I see

395
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,719
you might have posted TripAdvisor if

396
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,070
you're a traveler and you'd like to

397
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,290
review stuff I'm gonna look there as

398
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,850
well so there's those are some different

399
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,910
areas you can look to pick up

400
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,380
information so I'll start with real

401
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,089
names quite often that's what you're

402
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,850
given somebody's name maybe a company

403
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:36,620
name as well it's the most common

404
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,570
starting point again make sure it's

405
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,220
spelled correctly are they using the

406
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,440
middle name in their username so they

407
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,470
like to use that or the initial you know

408
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,680
start off just do some Google Dorking

409
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,930
LinkedIn

410
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,569
I love LinkedIn and it sounds

411
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,500
ridiculously simple but LinkedIn is so

412
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,630
nice because it gives you a nice

413
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,670
structure right if you send me a

414
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:58,399
LinkedIn request I will accept no matter

415
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:01,459
what because it just widens my scope of

416
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,170
search and for especially for a company

417
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:04,729
you can go in there and you can find the

418
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,800
structure you can find who reports to

419
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,660
who how involved they are in the

420
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,390
industry and usually you can find out

421
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,699
more social media accounts as well so

422
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,410
really like using that to start off with

423
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:17,149
some of my searches you want to begin

424
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,430
building a profile once you get this

425
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:21,380
initial information

426
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,969
family friends employment residents

427
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,199
those are the Meccan might go to areas

428
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,519
and those will take you off into

429
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:27,740
different areas depending on what you

430
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,329
find ultimately I want to work towards

431
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,990
getting those kind of four main areas

432
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:34,939
real name email addresses user names and

433
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,019
of course as many pictures as I can find

434
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,129
as well

435
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,329
depending on the occupation of the

436
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:40,949
person you're going to get to go to

437
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:43,920
certain sites most of us here are in

438
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:45,748
security or IT this is an example of a

439
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,748
site I'd go to if I have your real name

440
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:50,189
to see if you've registered any domains

441
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:51,569
domain registration is great it's

442
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:52,469
actually more private now they're

443
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:54,420
starting to hide a lot of that

444
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,579
information but it used to reveal a ton

445
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,259
of stuff like your phone number your

446
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:03,779
email address and stuff like that which

447
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:05,309
was fantastic so LinkedIn I just can't

448
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:07,170
can't get enough of LinkedIn it's just

449
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:09,089
such a fantastic tool for this sort of

450
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,128
work they try to make you pay for the

451
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:12,990
service to get more details

452
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:14,939
LinkedIn x-rays a great tool that you

453
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,939
can use to get past that and get great

454
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:18,569
searches it really takes the limitations

455
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:20,099
off of it

456
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:22,290
if you have their email address you can

457
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,639
just plug it into that URL there and get

458
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:28,589
their profile right away which makes

459
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:31,139
things a little faster so once you if

460
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:32,999
you have their username that's usually

461
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:35,329
you can usually guess that by first name

462
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:37,559
dot last name if if that doesn't work

463
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,819
you try to get their email address and

464
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:40,889
that'll usually have their username in

465
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:43,069
it and they'll usually reuse that across

466
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:47,059
platforms just like password reuse

467
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:48,959
you'll see user de Bree used quite a bit

468
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:51,480
so we want to look see if they've used

469
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,339
their middle name or not is this a

470
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,839
unique alias or are they reusing that

471
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:59,850
alias quite a bit you know is that is it

472
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,439
already existing now do they have a

473
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,029
number in it so quite often with a

474
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,349
company they'll add a number to the end

475
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:06,419
of their user name if there's already a

476
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:08,879
person in that company that has that

477
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:10,589
name and is it consistent across their

478
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,449
personal and their work so if it is

479
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:16,619
that's much easier as well if you have

480
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:18,390
their work email or username um so some

481
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,309
of the sites that I like to use to check

482
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,199
user names there's a couple of them here

483
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:24,809
you can plug it in and it'll these sites

484
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,429
are pretty similar how they work it'll

485
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:28,139
show you if that user name is used

486
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:30,630
across those different social media

487
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,490
accounts and it does dozens and dozens

488
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,860
of different social media platforms so

489
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,390
it's really nice and quick actually a

490
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,850
lot of these sites you can click on it

491
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,860
and it'll actually show you not only if

492
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,779
it's in use or not but also give you

493
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:46,049
information about that user name so for

494
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:47,220
a really quick check it's well worth it

495
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:48,940
I use all three because they're all

496
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,070
slightly different

497
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,519
if that doesn't work just manually check

498
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:56,500
these top four social media platforms I

499
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:59,500
like YouTube it's kind of the Forgotten

500
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,380
child quite often but YouTube's given me

501
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:05,590
some of the best results and in our in

502
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,059
our trace labs operations I see a lot of

503
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,668
people score really well with that as

504
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:12,190
well

505
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:14,139
for email so email is tricky I like to

506
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,299
make sure that it is actually owned by

507
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:17,559
the target quite often we see people

508
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:19,259
make mistakes with that where they just

509
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:21,759
assume it is because it's the same name

510
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:23,649
but often it's not so there's a lot of

511
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,269
email verification services out there

512
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:28,239
that you can use these are the top three

513
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:30,970
that I use that will actually validate

514
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,610
if it's real to start off with and then

515
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,570
it'll also tell you quite often

516
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,639
information about the user so it might

517
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,379
give you the person's name even phone

518
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:41,070
number things like that which is really

519
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:43,360
handy and moves you to the next level

520
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,950
the third from the bottom there will

521
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,600
actually browse the entire domain it

522
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,490
won't give you every email in the domain

523
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,899
but it'll give you a bunch of them which

524
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,970
is nice because then you can correlate

525
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:53,830
that with their friends and family or

526
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,240
other people that might be in that

527
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,220
company

528
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,200
of course Bing in Google and that should

529
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,850
be the top a list actually cuz I like to

530
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,139
do that quite often just that if you've

531
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:06,879
got their email address will usually

532
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:09,789
score you some good information now this

533
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,949
is the my favorite part with email and I

534
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:14,649
love to go to these breach data search

535
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,149
engines because I just take their email

536
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:18,008
plug it in there and it's going to tell

537
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:19,719
me all these other platforms that

538
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:21,549
they're using that have been breached so

539
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,620
just the fact that they're using those

540
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:25,840
other platforms is really nice to know

541
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,219
if you were a bad guy you could download

542
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,330
that breach data and then you probably

543
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,279
have their password if they haven't

544
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:33,610
changed it I'm not recommending you do

545
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:34,779
that but bad guys could you know and I

546
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,459
use all of them because they're all

547
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:39,279
slightly different you'll see a lot of

548
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,500
overlap again with those but they're all

549
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,120
slightly different Gravatar service so a

550
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,759
lot of people used to use this not so

551
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,219
much anymore but that usually will give

552
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,450
you a little bit information as well and

553
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,539
then if they've registered any sort of

554
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:55,090
DNS stuff which most of us in this room

555
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:56,620
have you can go to that your own and get

556
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,168
their more information

557
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,449
Ashley Madison so of course that's just

558
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:02,620
like the breach data one I was thinking

559
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,900
about this earlier

560
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,370
like if if this is breach data in

561
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,169
people's email addresses in there and

562
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:11,649
you find it I mean that's that's really

563
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:13,179
bad right so there's high risk for these

564
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,799
sort of things all these sites are gonna

565
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:17,590
get breached sooner or later right so if

566
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,539
it's something like Ashley Madison

567
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,370
you know there's huge potential there to

568
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:22,600
get in a lot of trouble quickly right

569
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,860
and you could sign up all your friends

570
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,299
for something like that because it's you

571
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,799
know it's gonna get breached later right

572
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:30,460
imagine those conversations with their

573
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:34,090
spouse or partner later later on right

574
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,860
so really really bad stuff so I spelt

575
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,149
LinkedIn wrong I just noticed that's

576
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,129
supposed to be LinkedIn so that's an

577
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:41,439
example of you know what you'll see for

578
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,450
me and some people will have even more

579
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,250
they'll have their websites which I love

580
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,779
public web sites are their personal web

581
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,390
sites that'll show you lots of great

582
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:50,799
information yeah just it's my favorite

583
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:56,440
just to get the ball rolling to start

584
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:58,000
with these are really popular sites to

585
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,490
use for for people to get more

586
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,220
information on an individual very

587
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,500
popular in the u.s. very us centric you

588
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,929
probably have versions of this here I

589
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,190
live in Canada that's where I reside so

590
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:11,620
for me if I'm looking up somebody in

591
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,899
Canada they don't work as good they

592
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,520
still do have some information I usually

593
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,479
blast through these when I'm looking for

594
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,429
somebody

595
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,340
pitbull usually is gives me the best

596
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:23,289
results it takes two seconds to do so I

597
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,730
recommend trying these out if you want

598
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:26,559
information on somebody

599
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,510
quite often it'll give me their home

600
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,250
address sometimes their phone number

601
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,110
there maybe their cell phone number and

602
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,539
information about their family which is

603
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,520
then something I can use as well and so

604
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:38,580
mileage will vary depending on what part

605
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,350
of the country or world you're in

606
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:44,830
snapchat so I'm not a huge snapchat

607
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:46,000
advocate for for OSINT it's pretty cool

608
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,139
because it does some neat things and

609
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,770
there's some interesting tools out there

610
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:53,559
I'm a huge fan of geolocation for OSINT

611
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:55,000
because usually an operation consists of

612
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:57,010
a certain scope you know you have a

613
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,919
certain place a certain time a certain

614
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:02,020
target so this there's a bunch of tools

615
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,390
out there for this app so if they're

616
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,590
using a snapchat you know you can

617
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,909
there's a tool here to search by

618
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,350
username so if you got username you can

619
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:10,960
find them pretty quickly which is nice

620
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,449
and then there's this map search content

621
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,220
app here which is cool and you can't

622
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,110
really see it but there's these like

623
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,210
blue

624
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,620
sir blue kind of circles on there you

625
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,480
can kind of near the top right above

626
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,399
where it says Coquitlam there's one so

627
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,110
you can click on there and and you can

628
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,240
see what's going on is someone snapchat

629
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,129
in that location at a certain time so

630
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,080
that's nice if you're looking for

631
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:34,230
location and time and they're using

632
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,840
snapchat so then we get into geolocation

633
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,930
so I really like using these sort of

634
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,270
tools echo SEC is very popular with the

635
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:44,850
agencies in Canada most of the law

636
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:47,220
enforcement teams use this and it's good

637
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:49,889
I really like it I tend to use ArcGIS

638
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,330
there's a free demo you can get you can

639
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,590
actually use the free demo of echo echo

640
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,350
though it's it's it's a little bit

641
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,179
limited in its functionality ArcGIS you

642
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:00,060
think you get the full version for 30

643
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:02,820
days the reason that I really like this

644
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:04,710
is because I basically start off I map

645
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,990
out on the map like it's like a Google

646
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:08,910
Maps interface the location that I want

647
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,950
to look at then I pick the social media

648
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:13,080
channels that I want you know Twitter or

649
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,700
Facebook all the usuals right and then

650
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,139
the time frame that I'm looking for

651
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,590
so if you know the persons in that

652
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,210
vicinity at that time it's really nice

653
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:24,000
or their friends or if there's any sort

654
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:25,440
of activity ArcGIS is used for emergency

655
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,230
management so if there's an earthquake

656
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,380
or some other big bad event you can use

657
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:33,150
it for that so you know it works great

658
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,410
for our purposes it's just not built for

659
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:39,720
our industry so a lot of people don't

660
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:41,430
know about it so I also like to go back

661
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,900
and use some of these tools because I

662
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,540
find quite often people that want to

663
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,130
erase their trace on the internet well

664
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,899
will do that and the people that are

665
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,490
really good at it will do it months in

666
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,650
advance so we've had several cases of

667
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:55,080
people disappearing and they just they

668
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,580
deleted a lot of their accounts but you

669
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,530
can go back in time of course with some

670
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,090
of these tools and kind of take a look

671
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,800
at what it looked like before it's

672
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:05,010
really hard to erase yourself off the

673
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:09,570
internet so this seems really simple but

674
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:12,000
it's really effective as well so just a

675
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:14,490
few more notes on going back in time and

676
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,750
looking at history of a place I use this

677
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,360
a lot I'm a huge fan of Google

678
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,460
Streetview typically when I'm doing

679
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,740
reconnaissance on a on a structure

680
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,510
although used I'll first look at Google

681
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,460
Maps I'll look at the perimeter I'll

682
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,840
look at the the top of the building to

683
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,260
see what they've got there I'll look at

684
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,449
for loading docks

685
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,830
look for entry from the roof look at

686
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,200
what's on the roof go through all of

687
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:37,120
that a street view is really cool as

688
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,980
well I use it all the time and I one of

689
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,809
the things I like about it is the

690
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,429
history that it keeps right so not only

691
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:44,139
am I looking at this this is a cigar

692
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:47,559
shop in in Paris if anybody was

693
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,460
wondering and it's you know it shows me

694
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,280
what it looks like from the outside

695
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,530
there's parking you know there's a a

696
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,149
single door on the front stuff like that

697
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,770
and you can see the street view in the

698
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,150
top left corner there and it's showing

699
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,730
me well there's other pictures I can

700
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:03,010
look at from other other time periods so

701
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,480
if I go back in time now I can see this

702
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:06,879
is more in the evening there's no

703
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,530
parking there the bus stop is gone look

704
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,660
at the garbage can so if I'm gonna do a

705
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,820
physical pentesting later this is my

706
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,620
reconnaissance mode I'm taking a look at

707
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,000
this oh they've got the steel doors that

708
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,399
closed at night okay so that's

709
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,200
interesting but for me like I like the

710
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,570
garbage bins because then I can pose as

711
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,100
the garbage person I can I know the

712
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,360
company name I know that they're

713
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,309
probably not shredding it looks like

714
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,299
they're just dumping stuff in there so

715
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:30,250
there's a bunch of things like that that

716
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:32,379
I'll look at and this is really simple

717
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,880
but there's every every company that I

718
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,169
look at there's always stuff like this

719
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,740
that I'll pick out from going back in

720
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:40,780
time like that so if your target is

721
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,030
mobile this is actually getting to be

722
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,220
more and more of the case give you an

723
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:47,410
example of this it's it's ironic but I

724
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:51,960
came here I flew here from Canada

725
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:53,380
I took oh what's the the German airline

726
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,630
Lufthansa

727
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,040
right so I flew at them and I was

728
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,730
actually somebody mentioned earlier they

729
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,080
saw my tweet

730
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,669
I was waiting in line and I get

731
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,850
frustrated really easily and then of

732
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:05,470
course I start tweeting and so I tweeted

733
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,760
something to them was like oh I'm

734
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,380
waiting in line for like five minutes

735
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,590
here and I put a picture of the people

736
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,660
in line and then today I got a an email

737
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:16,629
a great phishing attempt from them

738
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,010
apparently you know so it was very

739
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:21,090
timely so someone obviously was

740
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:23,559
monitoring that I'm just brilliant right

741
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:26,439
so that's an example of where people are

742
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:29,470
monitoring my my travel activity and

743
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,090
then responding to that so the bad guys

744
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,860
were really smart in that case because I

745
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,059
looked at and I almost clicked it

746
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,309
because it looked so good and it was

747
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,840
just perfectly timed but these are some

748
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:40,780
of the things I would look at trip case

749
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,870
very popular mobile app uber a little

750
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,280
bit harder to get information from the

751
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:47,860
but there's other ones that have more

752
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,440
kind of a forum based environment right

753
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,850
Airbnb everybody leaves their reviews on

754
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,050
there if you've got their username you

755
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,300
could probably find some of their stuff

756
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:57,310
there everybody's got travel points

757
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:02,399
that's another great area to take a look

758
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:05,050
at and then memberships rental car stuff

759
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,420
these forums like trip planner booking

760
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,129
com Expedia Priceline right a lot of

761
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,840
people are very active in those I bet

762
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,640
you most of this room is has at least

763
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,010
posted something once in one of these

764
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,300
forums right so that can tell me a

765
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,430
little bit about your travel habits

766
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,430
where you like to travel all that sort

767
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:24,190
of stuff I get into physical

768
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:26,380
infrastructure a little bit so usually I

769
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,330
kind of start there even if it's a

770
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,030
person I'm looking for I want to look at

771
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,020
where they reside and where they work

772
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,520
and I want to look at some of these

773
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,379
things if I'm doing a reconnaissance on

774
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,490
a company of course this is even more

775
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,710
important

776
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,730
I love funding the YouTube videos of the

777
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:41,260
tour of the office because that

778
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,610
basically gives me everything I need to

779
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,010
know all at once I just go

780
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:47,080
frame-by-frame I look at their wife I

781
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,540
look at their CCTV I look at their door

782
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,750
access I look at all those things it's

783
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,370
great commercial property information so

784
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,040
are they leasing and if so that's gonna

785
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:58,149
usually give me the whole floor plan

786
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,440
which is really handy especially if

787
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,870
you're going to do physical pen testing

788
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,940
and try to walk right in the door street

789
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,500
view so I talked about that huge fan of

790
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,260
that and then there's all this other

791
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,100
stuff as well right so all the

792
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,520
associated records that they're gonna

793
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,800
have with City Hall legal records fire

794
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,470
up show Dan so you see what they're IOT

795
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,860
looks like lots of opportunities there I

796
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:23,350
also like to get into their parking

797
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:25,139
there's security food delivery there's

798
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,699
lots of opportunities there as well so

799
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,950
tons of stuff I could talk for probably

800
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,380
an hour just on that technical

801
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,910
infrastructure so this is probably most

802
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,760
you're already pretty familiar with a

803
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:38,500
lot of these sites and tools some of the

804
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,200
ones that I really like is hurricane

805
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,120
Electric you know there's a lot more out

806
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,180
there now but that's been my go-to site

807
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,649
for ages and some of this a little bit

808
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,090
more private now as far as domain

809
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,790
registration and stuff like that but

810
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,169
there's still tons information out there

811
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,520
people really don't think about this and

812
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,390
they forget about it and it sits there

813
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,179
for years

814
00:28:55,390 --> 00:29:01,090
so it's usually I can find your name

815
00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:03,400
your email address your phone number and

816
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,600
that's great sometimes it's a DL so I

817
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,700
can get that as well

818
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,740
wiggle dotnet is one of my favorites

819
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,710
it's actually really accurate as well so

820
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,690
for your Wi-Fi SSID I can usually get

821
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:16,900
that for any particular company that's

822
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:19,410
always nice to have on the corporate

823
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:22,690
side so now you get more into I find the

824
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,010
culture and engagement with a company so

825
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:27,010
I like to go through the liver the

826
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,780
reviews for a company paste bin I'll set

827
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,320
up an alert Google Alerts I'll set that

828
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,799
up as well

829
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,809
LinkedIn again then I'll go through you

830
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,668
know corporate membership taxes

831
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:38,350
affiliations of any kind what the

832
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:41,559
company is doing online all that sort of

833
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:46,090
stuff for enjoyed individuals within a

834
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:47,889
company these are kind of a prioritized

835
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,809
list of sites that that I use and as

836
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:53,049
well as a lot of the trace labs members

837
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:55,240
can go through this right so Facebook

838
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:57,010
really gives you a good overview their

839
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,549
friends and who those are who the most

840
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:01,660
active Instagram daily habits right

841
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:03,970
SlideShare is surprisingly good for

842
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,350
reference letters which is really nice

843
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,510
to have because then you have a senior

844
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,270
person in the company and you have all

845
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,410
their contact information criminal

846
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,540
records

847
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,250
that's a goldmine if you can find it I

848
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,649
love personal websites as well so I

849
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,690
usually get a ton information from that

850
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:22,090
as well so I'm gonna go through a couple

851
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,340
examples of what trace labs has done

852
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:27,100
these are three people that I thought

853
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,540
you would find interesting and the O

854
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,330
scent that was done with those people

855
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,320
right so the first one was a girl

856
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,780
reported missing in Victoria British

857
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,270
Columbia not really a big social media

858
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,399
person so that was more difficult for

859
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,230
people but they've eventually found her

860
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,059
she posted something on a forum about

861
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:47,260
her cat a cat food or something like

862
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:49,260
that used that to get her username and

863
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,490
just guess her email from the username

864
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:54,129
found another post about her travel

865
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:56,880
plans and she was asking for room and

866
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:58,809
board in order to travel the island and

867
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,280
then found out that she was traveling

868
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:03,070
with two people which was interesting

869
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,020
and so use that information then to find

870
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:08,230
that Oh find who her she had a boyfriend

871
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:10,570
and found her boyfriends so

872
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,010
Media and found out that he had a

873
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,240
criminal record and with a history of

874
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:15,370
violence so this is all of a sudden

875
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:19,419
getting kind of bad right found six

876
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:22,149
aliases for her boyfriend and a bunch of

877
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:24,400
abandoned social media accounts drug and

878
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,720
criminal activity with her boyfriend so

879
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,820
right away people are thinking human

880
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,290
trafficking maybe and then immediately

881
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,879
after that we found out that she was

882
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,840
actually located so that's a really good

883
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,770
story but it kind of shows you how the

884
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,750
contestants kind of navigated through

885
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:40,510
this linking the bits and more

886
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,320
information together the next one a

887
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,750
young girl

888
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:48,879
so this is a bit of a sad story teenager

889
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:50,440
partying a lot no no solid residence so

890
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,000
she wasn't staying at home at all

891
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,720
never knew where she was her friends

892
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,240
never knew where she was out partying a

893
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,010
lot doing more and more drugs it looks

894
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,450
like and so our members found a lot of

895
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:04,059
this information how her lifestyle was

896
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:07,000
just escalating associated more and more

897
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:08,740
with criminals and eventually went to a

898
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,780
party at a grow-op do people know what

899
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:13,330
grow-ops are here are you familiar with

900
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,639
that term in North America it's where

901
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,710
you have like a house or a field and

902
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:22,030
you're growing drugs so it's like a

903
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:23,500
private criminal operation so so those

904
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:26,168
are those are not a good place to hang

905
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,669
out typically and of course that was the

906
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:30,190
last party she went to and then her it

907
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:31,540
was a body recovery after that so from

908
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,919
the information we collected you could

909
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,129
kind of tell where she was and where she

910
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:37,090
traveled to and then based off of that

911
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,530
we hope that the police can then

912
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:41,049
correlate kind of the direction of

913
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:44,740
travel and possible route that these

914
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:46,389
people could have taken so then a third

915
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,660
example was a person that went missing

916
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:51,910
and father and husband of a family just

917
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,440
goes missing and family doesn't know

918
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:56,350
what happened they're concerned of

919
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,000
course and his image shows up on a

920
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,590
social media site and I can't remember

921
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,750
if it was the same image or just one

922
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:03,970
that we that got picked up from social

923
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,440
recognition and those are getting

924
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,110
surprisingly good now so doesn't have to

925
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,600
be the same picture and figured out that

926
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:12,699
it was the same guy we got some unique

927
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,530
identifiers there that identified okay

928
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,150
that's that that's the guy so he

929
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,260
basically just ran away and this was one

930
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:20,020
where he was trying to avoid child

931
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,549
support and and so we gave that over to

932
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,559
law enforcement and so he

933
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:25,899
went from Toronto to Montreal I believe

934
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:29,350
so that was really interesting one for

935
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:30,789
us target evasion so we see this a

936
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:32,320
little bit most people are not very good

937
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:34,389
at this we've seen a few that have been

938
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,039
really good depending on how

939
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:38,619
sophisticated they are and how much time

940
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:42,639
and effort they put into it we had one

941
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:44,590
where it was a child abduction the there

942
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:48,039
was a couple that were divorced and the

943
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:50,139
husband came and took the child and

944
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:52,480
disappeared so tons of social media

945
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:54,039
activity and then none and then you know

946
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,559
zero visibility

947
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:58,499
so we believe they left the country he

948
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,940
had contacts in other parts of the world

949
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:03,129
but in that case there was nothing

950
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,710
nobody found anything so it's rare but

951
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:07,269
we do see some of that some of the

952
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,290
attacks we see is they just abandon

953
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:10,270
their accounts and they don't do

954
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,730
anything else which we saw in this case

955
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:15,399
fake data so I think there's definitely

956
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:17,679
a service opportunity out there for fake

957
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:19,348
data generation and but that takes a lot

958
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,579
of work and it's not foolproof either

959
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:23,260
removal of accounts it doesn't really

960
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:26,230
work that well like you can delete your

961
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:29,559
Facebook account but it's it's not that

962
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:31,659
great aliases of course and then try not

963
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:33,760
to live on the internet right trying to

964
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:35,530
go unplugged extremely difficult for

965
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,260
most people most people will plug in at

966
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:40,510
some point to to get an update and stuff

967
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,589
like that it's just a matter of time the

968
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,000
thing that really I find super

969
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:44,558
interesting and if any of you have seen

970
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,349
this I'd be really interested in talking

971
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:50,020
to you about it is honey pots for like a

972
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:52,149
perimeter alert basically bad guys

973
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:55,210
figuring out when you're looking for

974
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:57,900
them and I think that as people get more

975
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:00,790
sophisticated we may see more of that so

976
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,380
now I'm almost done just want to get

977
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,029
into this a little bit and again I'd

978
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,650
really be curious to hear your thoughts

979
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,150
on it

980
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,890
trace labs has been really successful

981
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:10,869
and it's the it's it kind of proved the

982
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,368
model works this crowd-sourced open

983
00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:16,630
source intelligence it's cost-effective

984
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:18,520
its scalable and it produces results so

985
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:19,569
it's very new for law enforcement so

986
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,460
they look at this and they're kind of

987
00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:23,619
like confused on how to work with us

988
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,660
it's been very positive so far so the

989
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:27,579
worst cases they just ignore us best

990
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,690
cases they're like hey yeah this is cool

991
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:30,849
and they actually come in and

992
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,980
participate in our CTF sometimes which

993
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:33,760
is great and so we're seeing more and

994
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,860
more of that

995
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,200
but going

996
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,540
the next level now we can apply the same

997
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,850
model to a bunch of other things right

998
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,160
so you know we can do this trend

999
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,540
analysis of the last few years on where

1000
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,670
we're going to kind of figure out you

1001
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,350
know what's gonna be next and we

1002
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,150
continue to give up privacy for

1003
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:53,730
convenience of course I mean we're all

1004
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,620
doing that more and more so where I

1005
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,940
really see this going and I have

1006
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,190
acquaintances that are working on this

1007
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:02,340
is really intelligence for on anyone at

1008
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,900
anytime for anyone really right so you

1009
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,250
don't have to spend a lot of money to

1010
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,530
learn everything you need to know about

1011
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,700
anybody so if you if you have a job

1012
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,990
interview you want to learn about who's

1013
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,990
interviewing you you want to learn about

1014
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:15,120
who you're interviewing anything right

1015
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,830
and I don't see that as being expensive

1016
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,049
to get if we when we crowdsource it

1017
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,970
right so you know this is going to get

1018
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:23,190
into an area where we're very quickly

1019
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,049
able to just and if the click of a

1020
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:27,870
button get a very nice report out right

1021
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:28,920
so you know the convenient right you

1022
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,080
quite often you're gonna want that

1023
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,090
information but how do you feel about

1024
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,580
being a target of that information right

1025
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:38,310
so I think this is going to be very new

1026
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:40,319
thing for people and and with a little

1027
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:42,480
bit of controversy so I'm very curious

1028
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,850
what you think about that so I'd

1029
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,260
appreciate any feedback if you're

1030
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:49,110
looking for resources these are some of

1031
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,310
the resources that I recommend of course

1032
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,860
if you're interested in trace labs

1033
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:55,020
that's the URL right there we're always

1034
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,210
looking for feedback and people to to

1035
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,710
help us out we have ongoing operations

1036
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,780
so if you want real-world OSINT

1037
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,310
experience we provide that if you want

1038
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,840
to have a CTF environment we provide

1039
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:07,110
that as well we're doing multiple every

1040
