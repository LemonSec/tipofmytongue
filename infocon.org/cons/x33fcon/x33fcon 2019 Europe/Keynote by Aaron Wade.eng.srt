1
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:14,518
all right well good morning first up

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,940
blush I thank you for the introduction I

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,698
think my talk is over I'll just stop now

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:25,140
that was great so give you guys quick

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:27,210
intro just real quick second about me

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,550
and then we'll really get to why we're

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,790
here I've been doing this work for about

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,290
20 years focusing in primarily on threat

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,629
hunting methodology spending an awful

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,120
lot of time doing that kind of work

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,280
current job title not that it matters I

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,959
lead a team like blush I said I'm chief

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,420
of research than a pretty large

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,090
organization and you can find me online

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,020
at that twitter handle as mentioned here

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:56,280
so why are we here today we're here

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,469
today because since our youth we've been

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,690
taught that blue and red are against

19
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,600
each other this is Rock'em Sock'em

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,420
robots if you're not familiar since

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,090
early childhood maybe its contrasting

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,860
colors the reasoning but really what it

23
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,610
ends up being is that it becomes a fight

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,740
against good and evil red versus blue

25
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,869
and throughout our various episodes we

26
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,630
learn that you know we end up chopping

27
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,580
each other's limbs off quite a bit early

28
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,000
days your defender on top might lose his

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,860
hand goes back read tools skills up and

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,890
then comes back and fights off the

31
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,590
penultimate bad guy and ends up chopping

32
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,619
his hand off strangely enough and we go

33
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,119
back and forth through this overtime so

34
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,290
today what I really want to focus in on

35
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,329
is taking this type of story and

36
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,220
challenging your perspective so we

37
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,169
collectively viewed the world through a

38
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,200
series of what amounts to maybe a straw

39
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,710
very narrow lens and you're probably

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:01,439
looking at this gosh yeah that's some

41
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:03,750
really nice jewelry but really if you

42
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,020
widen your perspective you see something

43
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,318
entirely different and yeah that's

44
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,879
exactly what it appears to be and if you

45
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,380
didn't notice it check out this guy

46
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,200
right here he looks super

47
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,299
uncomfortable being in that position and

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,769
so that's that moment of recognition

49
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,940
that some people have when you change

50
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,580
their perspective so perspective as it

51
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,100
relates to our world today is really

52
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,080
centering around two things one I have

53
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,630
to wield both a red and a blue team

54
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,250
effectively to defend an environment but

55
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,470
in order for them to work together we

56
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,920
actually have to put down our proverbial

57
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,400
swords and learn to complement one

58
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,880
another

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,710
a quick revisit of a couple of concepts

60
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,160
that were introduced a couple of years

61
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:53,520
ago here I call this Maui gorilla and

62
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,950
some hunter principles on the left in

63
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,760
that chart you'll see defender typical

64
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,130
defender characteristics and some form

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,130
of typical attacker characteristics when

66
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,750
an attack group comes in you can notice

67
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,060
the disparity between the two right off

68
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,910
even in just the typical organizational

69
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,790
size but down through the details you

70
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:18,690
see very very different approaches to

71
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,940
how they deal with problems and the

72
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,940
takeaway here is really that a targeted

73
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,910
organization has a series of advantages

74
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,920
that they need to learn how to use and

75
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,859
exercise their capabilities and

76
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,619
strengths to defend themselves and it's

77
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,600
done through switching constantly

78
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,140
between two mindsets this is where red

79
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,780
and blue come together offensive mindset

80
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,640
really centers around aggressive defense

81
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,110
in the form of diminishing and

82
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,600
adversaries ability to operate

83
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,730
independently in your environment down

84
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,350
to the point where you can make it

85
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,750
impossible for them to operate in your

86
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,910
environment and defensively you really

87
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,250
want to exercise a learning organization

88
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,170
methodology learning from every attack

89
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,810
and then leveraging that to your

90
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,660
advantage in the form of environmental

91
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,570
changes so you really want to look at

92
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:11,160
every every attempt that comes to you is

93
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,470
a form of free intelligence that you

94
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:18,510
need to learn how to translate into some

95
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,370
form of advantage one of the ways that

96
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,520
we do this is by applying a target

97
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,110
centric methodology so we can set a

98
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,609
target to be any number of things maybe

99
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,360
it's a threat actor maybe it's a piece

100
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,039
of technology

101
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,340
you're an asset or a series of controls

102
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,900
that you need to go in and evaluate and

103
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,150
you'll always start with a customer in

104
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,948
this environment so you work it through

105
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,560
one two three four five and six

106
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:44,460
working through needs and information

107
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,319
gathering collection series of analysis

108
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,479
and synthesis synthesis steps and

109
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,860
bringing back some form of actionable

110
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,479
intelligence to your customer who

111
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:56,430
ultimately needs to decide whether or

112
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:58,830
not to take that action and as we

113
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,569
evaluate this target centric methodology

114
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,250
you can evaluate that as two separate

115
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:04,740
networks my network and their network

116
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,889
but who are they right so we're gonna

117
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,680
spend some time talking about they some

118
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,810
folks might recognize some of these

119
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,469
things some might disagree but that's

120
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,189
okay

121
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:18,779
that's why this is called the discourse

122
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:21,090
so let's talk about a specific series of

123
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,430
threats or threat actors what actually

124
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:27,330
drives them Ryan how do we begin to

125
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,610
understand and unpack who they are we

126
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,210
start with the the arrow model here

127
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,949
we're talking about China for a second

128
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,229
China in a national policy level will

129
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:40,289
set out some form of objectives to leap

130
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:42,539
ahead to otherwise leap over their

131
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:43,680
competitors and replace them in a in a

132
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,680
given environment in their own

133
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,750
environment for that matter so they

134
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,339
follow what's what's described as an

135
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,129
introduction assimilation secondary

136
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:55,800
innovation process or reinnervation or

137
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:58,439
thusly stated as the leap ahead

138
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,529
methodology so they'll bring in new

139
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,580
technology through variety of means

140
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:04,949
introduce that into their environment

141
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,318
assimilate that bring that into their

142
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,599
manufacturing reverse engineering

143
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,930
process is looking to localize the

144
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:15,240
skillsets and actually increase

145
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,710
indigenous capabilities from there they

146
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,330
take the building blocks and they add on

147
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:23,460
and after the add-on is complete or at

148
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,589
least through stage of completion you'll

149
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,508
see them start to branch out word and

150
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:30,930
project out into the world in a compete

151
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:33,180
and replace stage and finally to a point

152
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,459
where they are ready to leap ahead of

153
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,199
their competition and at that point you

154
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:41,190
start to see a reduction in investment

155
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,410
by foreign companies and so

156
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,680
as you walk that down the left-hand side

157
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,140
here you start to observe what the

158
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,450
policies are maybe multiple multi-year

159
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,880
plans people like to talk about the 13th

160
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:57,030
five-year plan there are multiple

161
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,330
multi-year plans that are in play not

162
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:03,960
just any one but really what those do is

163
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:06,870
activate needs or create opportunities

164
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,390
for this larger middle section where you

165
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,420
see state-owned enterprises private

166
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,460
companies universities a range of

167
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:18,540
investments occur even global events

168
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,489
begin to trigger activity sets and even

169
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,860
a needs data that that's identified

170
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,740
through indigenous capability gaps and

171
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,020
that is really what begins to lead into

172
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,480
what we see is intelligence operations

173
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,950
and well most of us are familiar with as

174
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:37,590
a PT activity but they're not all bad

175
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:41,010
that's that bottom graph for you there's

176
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:43,020
a spectrum of threat ranging from what

177
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:46,500
we consider to be more or less on the

178
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:49,560
the bad side inherently bad to us or

179
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:53,340
evil to us and the average citizen more

180
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,320
to the right hand side the difficulty

181
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:59,369
with this threat spectrum and this

182
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:03,080
threat grouping is the ability and the

183
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:06,260
wanton use of intelligence services to

184
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:12,599
satisfy the needs of the state and

185
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:16,740
Industry and so we offer a framework of

186
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,390
what this espionage what framework of

187
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,270
espionage can look like for these threat

188
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,610
actors so one you see the intelligence

189
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:26,700
services for state supported industrial

190
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,340
development that's Intel for industry

191
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,080
you see Intel for military which is

192
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,110
maybe more traditional what you would

193
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,370
expect between nations

194
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,010
you see government-sponsored non

195
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,260
intelligence so maybe civilian for state

196
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:44,280
supported industry maybe an S&T science

197
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,020
and technology organization you see the

198
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,130
companies themselves engaging in this

199
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:52,470
behavior or leveraging the operators for

200
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,140
this and then finally you end up with

201
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,280
the individual that individual might be

202
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,980
more or less categorized as

203
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,959
entrepreneurial going into business for

204
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,490
themselves may be looking to sell some

205
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,130
of those secrets that they've taken to

206
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:09,090
some of these other actor sets up above

207
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:12,060
so let me give you another frame of

208
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,460
reference we call this the innovation

209
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,410
bathtub when you look at what amounts to

210
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:21,480
a joint operation or joint development

211
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:23,189
unit you'll see that this mimics what a

212
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,290
company might go through when they go

213
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,620
ahead and release a new product into the

214
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:32,310
world there's early research it branches

215
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,950
out into use of universities labs

216
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:38,640
centers even contractors get pieces of

217
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,230
the work and below the line is really

218
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,250
what you call below the the point of

219
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,450
visibility for most folks where that

220
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,280
information technology all starts to

221
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,840
come together in the form of actual

222
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,550
technology development or product

223
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,290
development and it goes through a series

224
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,420
of phases and eventually it comes out

225
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,959
the other end in form of operational

226
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,490
usage and/or commercial sales so what

227
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,740
happens when we put a threat into that

228
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,510
bathtub we change some of that language

229
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,880
around we recognize a couple of things

230
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,760
in the upper right-hand quadrant this is

231
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,050
where we all typically live in

232
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,230
operational use we are at the tail end

233
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,660
of the bathtub on the bottom left that's

234
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,760
really more difficult to see we don't

235
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,290
typically get visibility down in that

236
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,330
realm there's communication there's

237
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,930
planning there's all sorts of activities

238
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:27,090
that occur and then there's the the

239
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,640
darker shaded orange blocks which are

240
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,130
not impossible to see into but it takes

241
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,530
a very specific focus if you want to

242
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,050
engage in that and so what I'll leave

243
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,819
you with in this regard is it's really a

244
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,430
matter of your investment of time and

245
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,820
whether or not you see the value in

246
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,920
investigating each of these so let's

247
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,650
start to make this a little bit real if

248
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,099
possible here with a fictitious Brett

249
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:56,069
Group this threat group is what we might

250
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,900
all consider an actor set we're an

251
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,970
activity group depending on which frame

252
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:03,870
of reference you use for modeling threat

253
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:06,480
actors there's a set of operators in an

254
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,270
operational pattern here they report

255
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,770
into a lead operator maybe they

256
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,180
report up into command and control and

257
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,600
there's a separate development group

258
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:17,989
something to that effect and they

259
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,750
exhibit some form of these TTP's

260
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:25,580
capabilities and they leverage them to

261
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:27,350
have an effect on a target the only

262
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,300
thing about this threat group is you

263
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,850
know and we're gonna get into a grace

264
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,920
basin in in the intelligence world you

265
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:37,880
know a lot of folks would disagree that

266
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,099
our posit rather that knowing who

267
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,870
doesn't always matter and for the most

268
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,260
part if you stay and live within this

269
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:47,420
realm it's absolutely true well we're

270
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,870
going to unpack some of these threat

271
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,670
groups so in the past two years there

272
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,550
have been a number of indictments by the

273
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,020
United States Department of Justice

274
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,689
really fascinating if you haven't read

275
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,310
them I just you you there's a couple out

276
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,470
there I just you can google it

277
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,790
Department of Justice China espionage

278
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:09,200
something to that effect and you will

279
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:13,280
find these but what we find is a series

280
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:17,060
of actors that are named number one but

281
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:20,089
two they each share some form of family

282
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:22,369
system or background they come from a

283
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:26,510
similar set of backgrounds whether it be

284
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:31,490
universities hacking groups forums not

285
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:33,080
unlike us and what you also note is some

286
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,200
of the language that comes out in the

287
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,230
indictment identifies people as personal

288
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,990
friends or acquaintances or associates

289
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,760
suggesting maybe a working relationship

290
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:47,630
versus I know this person outside of

291
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,540
work and as you evaluate some of these

292
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:53,330
you start to spot maybe the actor on the

293
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,890
far left he's he knows web shells he

294
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,440
knows how to hack web servers things

295
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:00,920
like that a couple of malware developers

296
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,840
in the mix and so you see that maybe the

297
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,430
the malware group or the development

298
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,280
group is tightly integrated with the

299
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:11,780
operators a little bit more than maybe

300
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:14,060
you would see otherwise and what's not

301
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:17,720
really illuminated in this view of the

302
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:20,270
the picture rather of the group is this

303
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,380
gentleman in the middle was spotted the

304
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:27,770
the Merv I call him Merv he was spotted

305
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,990
in forums in 2012 responding to what

306
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:32,600
amounted to a work order that suggested

307
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:36,950
that somebody was looking for full scope

308
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:40,850
penetration testing looking for five to

309
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:42,620
fill five vacancies and people would get

310
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,780
paid they would live in an apartment and

311
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,520
they would earn more money then they

312
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,339
could earn anywhere else in a single

313
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,110
month if they completed their objectives

314
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:54,800
within a month the Department of Justice

315
00:13:51,110 --> 00:14:00,110
had him and his situ active in this

316
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:02,060
activity set the thing that you also

317
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,160
start to illuminate as you read these

318
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,310
indictments this is peering under the

319
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,280
hood a little bit more is that it's not

320
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:12,469
just one activity group they travel in

321
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,470
some form of circles which is

322
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:17,770
interesting and interesting only in the

323
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,690
fact of understanding what we ourselves

324
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:24,980
collectively identify as an activity

325
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:27,050
group many will focus strictly on just

326
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,470
the TTP's that are observed or

327
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,849
observable that's totally appropriate

328
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:35,630
this however gives you a different sense

329
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:38,150
of maybe the self-organizing nature of a

330
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:40,400
threat group respond to a job offer any

331
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,540
five people can fill those vacancies as

332
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,110
long as they are qualified

333
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:47,030
voila you have a new activity group but

334
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,130
it may be comprised of the exact same

335
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,319
people so the composition of that team

336
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:54,890
may dictate the TTP's that you can

337
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,390
observe so for example the web operator

338
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,980
that I highlighted before wasn't

339
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,990
originally a part of this group he was

340
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,080
called in as he's called as a personal

341
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:05,990
favor he was asked to come help break

342
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,510
into a web server and deploy some

343
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,280
malware for the other operators so he

344
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,980
was an add-on so if you were strictly

345
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,260
looking at that group you might actually

346
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,880
start to break it into two now because

347
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:21,530
you see different characteristics of

348
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,590
them on the wire but it doesn't stop

349
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,680
there

350
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,540
there's a human element to this so here

351
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,699
you start to see human enabled cyber and

352
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:35,380
joint operations between the physical

353
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:37,390
and the cyber worlds where the Ministry

354
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,100
of State Security up at the top this is

355
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:42,069
who was behind the scenes so this is

356
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,990
your command and control unit a number

357
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:47,710
of directors section Chiefs what have

358
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:49,450
you running the HUMINT operation and the

359
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:52,330
human to operation really consisted in

360
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:54,850
this indictment at least of two

361
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,050
individuals that were named if you

362
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,940
combine a number of the other

363
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,420
indictments you will see that this web

364
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:05,410
actually grows pretty tremendously but

365
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:08,490
of pointed interest as it relates to the

366
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:11,110
WHO versus the how conversation

367
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:15,220
sometimes the who illuminates the how

368
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:18,580
and so if you look at the human activity

369
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:21,910
set you can understand that they

370
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:24,490
co-opted or coerced an ITC or security

371
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:27,339
manager to run part of the operation his

372
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:31,120
single task was to report on the

373
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:33,760
response effort so how many people

374
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,040
actually have an insider whose single

375
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:40,510
job it is to report on your activities

376
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:42,730
in your threat model it's an interesting

377
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:45,180
question but I doubt that many people

378
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,860
have considered that as an option

379
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,079
another person this this lower

380
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:54,820
individual is a product manager at the

381
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:56,530
China branch whose job it was to insert

382
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,960
things into computers that contained

383
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:03,010
proprietary malware at the time to this

384
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:08,770
group so in country you have employees

385
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:11,980
who are at risk of co-opt or coercion by

386
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,689
an intelligence organization to increase

387
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,459
the effectiveness of the cyber

388
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:18,910
organization of the cyber unit that

389
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:20,920
operator group and depending on how much

390
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:23,980
you believe in the open-source how

391
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,380
well-researched you you this is you'll

392
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,209
find that there's also those linkages so

393
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,700
remember the bathtub there's linkages at

394
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,440
least in public some of the indictments

395
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,890
illuminate some of this to to a couple

396
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,180
of universities contract units security

397
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:43,300
companies

398
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:44,800
and then so yeah in more so as I was

399
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:49,570
doing this you know I started to

400
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:52,090
evaluate is this a pattern so from the

401
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:56,050
perspective of history so we're going

402
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:59,439
back now about 13 years you can start to

403
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:01,899
see in history this pattern is repeated

404
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,560
so there's almost like a template for

405
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:07,210
how an operator group gets formed

406
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,919
wayback machine withered rose many

407
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,540
people would know him if you did dark

408
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,600
visitor research or anything like that

409
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,610
when the the old days came from a

410
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,060
university recruited and led a group he

411
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,679
was tied to some underground forums he

412
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,629
dropped out for six months to do project

413
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,000
work that was really refining his

414
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,100
malware and implants and technique and

415
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,350
eventually he was arrested for stepping

416
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,939
out of line or what is perceived to be

417
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,439
stepping out of line running DDoS for

418
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,600
blackmail purposes maybe to make some

419
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,310
money on the side there were four

420
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,899
additional operators in the group one

421
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,760
who got kicked out for what is presumed

422
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,040
to be bad behavior there's a little bit

423
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,830
of squishiness around that nobody knows

424
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,230
for sure at least that I'm aware of and

425
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:49,419
then you see very similar individual

426
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,910
down at the bottom who is a close

427
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,760
personal friend of the lead operator who

428
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:56,890
is also the malware developer that's not

429
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,110
to suggest that these are equal or

430
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,720
connected more so that there's a

431
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:05,830
template for how these organizations and

432
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,480
groups come together to operate and run

433
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,669
their their individual sets of

434
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,040
operations against victim companies or

435
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:15,040
target companies now I know you're

436
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,080
probably thinking bla che why did you

437
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,129
invite this crazy person to come here

438
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,889
and talk about all this stuff that

439
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:23,470
doesn't matter I would posit that it

440
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,880
does matter but it truly will depend on

441
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,750
who your customer are and what your

442
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,880
network looks like and so when we think

443
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,500
about that put their operational

444
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,990
capabilities in that target box in a

445
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,180
target centric methodology how do you

446
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:42,220
begin to target these capabilities to

447
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:44,800
defend yourself first things first

448
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,420
know your network who is a part of your

449
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,100
network in a tactical and operational

450
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,720
sense you probably have a couple of

451
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,590
teams maybe you work with them maybe you

452
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,710
don't on an active

453
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,809
basis but this is probably who should be

454
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,880
in your network or at least peripherally

455
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:59,049
in your network at a tactical and

456
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,880
operational level you probably have your

457
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:02,820
sock your shirt your architecture group

458
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,710
your compliance group your risk group

459
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,960
your red team is actually a part of your

460
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,610
network vulnerability management team

461
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,130
patch management whatever you call them

462
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,809
in your organization maybe your your

463
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:16,720
physical security folks who do your

464
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:19,168
investigations of humans and then

465
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,220
obviously your threat intelligence group

466
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:22,539
on the right hand side the folks that

467
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,110
are maybe more interested in the higher

468
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:27,640
order of the information in an

469
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,709
operational maybe strategic level you

470
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,100
probably have your business teams your

471
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:36,850
leadership maybe your legal HR teams and

472
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,799
even into your supply chain the key here

473
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,990
as we've learned this over the past

474
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,649
several years of doing it is that you

475
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:46,539
have to learn and use a common language

476
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:48,719
so some people send a round attack some

477
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:51,879
use diamond model some use kill chain

478
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,740
some use all three some come up with

479
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,110
their own language that's perfectly okay

480
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,850
but the key is to have a common bond

481
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,139
that you can communicate with between

482
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,418
all of these different parts of the

483
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:05,470
organization it does no good if you're

484
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:07,299
all speaking past each other your

485
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:10,059
customer and their needs well who is

486
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,860
your customer if you are a red team your

487
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:14,918
customer is everybody not the red team

488
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:18,789
on this map right if you are the Intel

489
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:22,720
team the same and on and on and on it

490
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:25,510
takes this grouping of operational teams

491
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,270
inside of an organization to defend it

492
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:31,600
effectively no one team can do this on

493
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,250
their own but the trick here is actually

494
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,428
treating each other like customers as

495
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:39,669
opposed to just noisy team members that

496
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:41,919
you can tend to ignore but I've also

497
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:43,990
started to identify a couple of needs of

498
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,820
each of the customers now I'm not going

499
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,740
to identify their problems because every

500
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,360
company has different sets of problems

501
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,890
maybe you're in an industrial

502
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,039
organization maybe you're in aviation

503
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:56,919
maybe you are a healthcare organization

504
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,320
your problems and needs will vary to a

505
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:02,169
degree between the type of organization

506
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,280
you are but that said generally speaking

507
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:05,920
you can s

508
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,050
that your teams inside your organization

509
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,540
need these these bits of information

510
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:12,760
from you and that's typically what you

511
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:17,610
might try to exchange between the

512
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:19,510
different parts word of caution that

513
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,040
intelligence is only actionable if

514
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:23,200
there's a process and a capability to

515
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,670
consume it and that part of the

516
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,260
organization knows how to act on that

517
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,120
information that is actionable

518
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,790
intelligence in a nutshell so when you

519
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,500
hear that when people ask you for that

520
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:35,320
type of information one of the the key

521
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,580
discriminators is to ask them if they

522
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,950
know how to consume the information

523
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,500
number one and know what actions they

524
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:45,550
can take if they don't then there's

525
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:48,040
probably a wanted discussion to have to

526
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,899
you maybe want to reconsider the output

527
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,940
of your team and where you're trying to

528
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,610
direct it and whether or not it's really

529
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,040
worth the effort so to that end if you

530
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,929
start with the four that I have not

531
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,420
crossed off you're probably in a very

532
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:05,530
good place which leads to the focus on

533
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:07,510
the how not the who because these teams

534
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:14,350
need the how type information to defend

535
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:17,290
an organization so one thing that we've

536
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:20,409
learned also over time is that defenders

537
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:23,350
carry a lot of hubris with them a lot of

538
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:26,260
confidence in what they do whether it is

539
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:28,510
you know the belief that we have

540
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,400
everything covered that we know enough

541
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,710
about our adversary that we know enough

542
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,230
about ourselves to say that yes we can

543
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,550
defend it we can defend ourselves we can

544
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:40,300
defend our company we can defend our

545
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:43,120
customers if you look at any set or

546
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,280
series of public disclosures breaches

547
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,770
any sort of notification that's occurred

548
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:52,270
in the media the blue team probably

549
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:55,060
doesn't have everything covered so we

550
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:57,879
start with an evaluation of how much do

551
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:01,060
you know now this leads into some form

552
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:04,900
of vanity metric typically some count of

553
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:06,129
something but really you know that blue

554
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,130
team will take a look at that and say

555
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:11,200
yep we're good if you ask them probably

556
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:14,560
on the first cut we've got you covered

557
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,820
it takes a real candid organization to

558
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,260
admit that they don't have things

559
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,790
covered

560
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,879
but typically the more you dig in on

561
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:24,080
that you'll find this type of patterning

562
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,700
within any kind of intelligence

563
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,050
organization inside of a company or

564
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:32,300
socks or anything to that effect because

565
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,100
really if we're all consuming from the

566
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,120
same intelligence providers which many

567
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:40,429
of us are you'll find that there's this

568
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,379
corpus in the middle that's usually

569
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,480
around the delivery phases or all the

570
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,970
way into installation maybe a little bit

571
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,970
into command and control that would be

572
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,800
number six there but really when you

573
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,910
consume intelligence from an external

574
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,550
organization you're really getting that

575
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:59,540
middle so it almost becomes a bell curve

576
00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:02,090
some some normal curve here excuse me

577
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:06,320
and the tails become the most difficult

578
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:07,399
parts to to achieve insight into so on

579
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,350
the left hand side it's actually

580
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,630
extremely difficult it takes a very

581
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:14,600
focused efforts probably not necessarily

582
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:17,210
worth the time of most organizations to

583
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,429
do recon detection not just scans but

584
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,380
the actual targeting exercises and

585
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:24,200
document retrieval that an actor might

586
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,940
use against you and on the right hand

587
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,940
side that information typically comes

588
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:31,070
from compromises typically shared by

589
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,200
people in who ride around in cars with

590
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,610
each other or go to super-secret

591
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,590
squirrel meetings and they they do

592
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,800
secret handshakes and they exchange some

593
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,699
bits of information in private

594
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,050
unfortunately a lot of that information

595
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,970
never makes it out into the public and

596
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:48,320
it never makes it into your intelligence

597
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:50,090
feed either and so what does this

598
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,100
mapping kind of look like in reality

599
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,350
most likely well if you break that down

600
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,240
you can if you have a real candid

601
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,909
organization now this is a mapping

602
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,710
against those indictments so these are

603
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:02,270
TTP's extracted from that set of

604
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,030
indictments for this set of actors that

605
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:07,220
I talked about before so here we talk

606
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:10,430
about the how so you've got a couple of

607
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:12,470
major methods of delivery phishing

608
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:15,290
passive web so your strategic web

609
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,730
compromises scan and exploit so you know

610
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,590
a scanning web server from the

611
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,630
outside-in or some application server

612
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:23,030
from the outside-in and then launching

613
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,440
an exploit against it human enabled

614
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,879
cyber really mounting to getting

615
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,080
somebody to take an action for you

616
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,430
whether that's plugging something in

617
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,530
clicking something something to that

618
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,570
effect

619
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:34,780
and the third-party or supply chain

620
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:36,610
attack and then off to the right you see

621
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,410
the rest of them and off to the far

622
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:40,360
right you see the things that will never

623
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:42,130
fit into an attack map or at least that

624
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,500
currently do not fit into an attack map

625
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:47,680
so these would be left off of anybody's

626
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:50,230
modeling for the most part that would be

627
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,850
co-opting an insider probably not

628
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:54,640
sitting in an attack model or framework

629
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:56,889
today not that it shouldn't maybe

630
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,840
there's room to grow here for the

631
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:01,900
community its how I would see that

632
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:04,149
really an opportunity to look at outside

633
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:08,680
of just the pure cyber realm and into

634
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:11,290
where human and cyber blend together and

635
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,900
as a team evaluates these again you'll

636
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,670
find that there's notable gaps on the

637
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,280
bottom and I'm being generous with the

638
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:20,430
top here most likely for the bulk of

639
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:24,370
organizations that I would come across

640
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:27,250
in any kind of exchange so how do we

641
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,989
work these things together these are ten

642
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,360
critical questions that I've developed

643
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,370
over the past several years of doing

644
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,990
this that I've used for developing a

645
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:39,280
hunting methodology that I train people

646
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:41,170
on that I work teams through so if you

647
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,639
take one of those capabilities or TTP's

648
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:45,760
and you throw it into this and you start

649
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,710
to ask a series of questions a single

650
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,540
focal point or objective just to give

651
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,820
you example a couple years ago we did

652
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,320
one on PowerShell when we asked the

653
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,530
second question we ended up with I think

654
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:59,020
was 67 pages of raw material to weed

655
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:02,379
through to then get into the next sets

656
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:04,120
of questions so that collection effort

657
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,700
was actually quite massive to understand

658
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,580
how actors were using PowerShell not

659
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,200
just that they were using it but how and

660
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:14,199
then walking down through that list of

661
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,690
questions down into can I identify it

662
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,960
what conditions must be met for this to

663
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:23,200
work in the given environment if I can

664
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,270
identify it can I defeat it so praying

665
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,740
and playing on to the other parts of

666
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,330
your organization in your network that

667
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,210
are responsible for blocking and

668
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:33,250
tackling or prevention and protection

669
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,720
against threats or sets of activities

670
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,130
maybe that's your control group your

671
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,940
architecture group things like that

672
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:42,640
and second-order effect and second third

673
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,360
order thinking if I do end up blocking

674
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,809
it what do they

675
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,340
going to bring the next time and then

676
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,710
finally how do I get this into

677
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,750
production so a series of ten questions

678
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,250
that can be repeated and be handed off

679
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:57,880
to your teams and work through every

680
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:59,290
single time as a mode of operation or

681
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,740
really just to deliver a framework to

682
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:04,178
the team to consider how to to combat a

683
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:09,340
threat or really target their

684
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:11,679
capabilities and for the red team so we

685
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,350
talked about that capability map and the

686
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:18,160
fact that kc7 is usually a blank spot on

687
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:20,469
just about every TTP map and/or

688
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,960
capability map for defense unless you've

689
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,640
been through a series of intrusions the

690
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,770
red team actually gives you in the

691
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,960
ability to gain insight into how this

692
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:31,929
might operate or function in your

693
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:36,100
environment so it's no longer blue

694
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:37,540
against red it can't be how do we use a

695
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,480
red team well we use them to actually

696
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,309
curate our own offensive mindset so if

697
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,010
we have to get aggressive I have to

698
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:46,450
understand how a threat might actually

699
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:50,500
operate in my environment it will

700
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:53,049
largely be unique per target and per

701
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,640
target and even per ecosystem your

702
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:56,980
enterprise is not the same as your cloud

703
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,510
property a threat actor operating and

704
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,220
one might look very different than the

705
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:03,400
same threat actor operating in another

706
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:05,230
and between those two properties and a

707
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,870
different target they will look entirely

708
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:10,390
different so the red team provides a

709
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:14,500
threat to target in sight as it pertains

710
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:15,940
to your organization alone red team is

711
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,820
actually an intelligence function if you

712
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,440
view it in a different lens so they can

713
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,970
operate as a collector and a processor

714
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,710
of information they go out they run an

715
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,290
operation they bring back results in

716
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,179
findings that are then analyzed by your

717
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:30,040
other teams that are brought to good

718
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:32,410
effect on the target especially if your

719
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,020
target is maybe an asset or technology

720
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:37,390
in your environment they can provide

721
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:40,540
some form of capability evaluation of

722
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:42,100
your blue team they are solid advocates

723
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,690
for your blue team I think Tim Malcom

724
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:47,500
Vetter mentioned this in a blue hat talk

725
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:49,480
a red team with a customer can actually

726
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,040
advocate on behalf of the blue team to

727
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,040
give the blue team the visibility that

728
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,379
it needs so I break in I do bad things

729
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,920
to you as the threat I emulate that

730
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,860
active

731
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,660
set and I suggest that well you weren't

732
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,379
able to detect it maybe you need to give

733
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:07,000
the blue team visibility into that and

734
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,800
then finally they are an educator they

735
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,190
are one of the penultimate educators of

736
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,290
an organization but there's some magic

737
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:18,640
to be had there the red team actually

738
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:20,620
has to be very very well positioned I

739
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,680
would say to gain access to the right

740
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,360
portions of the the organization to

741
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,280
deliver that educational message to the

742
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,990
right teams maybe that's your network

743
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,830
team maybe that's your leadership

744
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:34,420
there's a wide variety of customers

745
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:37,540
inside of an environment that a red team

746
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:40,960
has to interact with which again points

747
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:42,520
me back to them actually looking and

748
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,680
feeling a lot like an intelligence team

749
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,470
so if your red team communicate with

750
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,550
your intelligence team learn from them

751
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,770
share with them and how they communicate

752
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:52,030
because the two parts of the

753
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,930
organization they're actually have to

754
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:57,160
communicate in a very similar fashion

755
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:59,580
when a red team partners with the blue

756
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,810
team what do they get in return

757
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,149
understanding of their attack tools and

758
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:06,010
their artifacts so I always say hey red

759
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,750
team here's access to my Splunk

760
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:11,020
environment or whatever my log

761
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:14,400
aggregation tool is my sim come find

762
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:16,930
yourself look and evaluate how you

763
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,180
actually are manifesting in this

764
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:21,910
environment you know I gave an example a

765
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:25,240
couple of years ago here related to

766
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:27,370
Cobalt strike changed my red team's

767
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,920
perspective on and how they're using

768
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:32,260
that tool and maybe the the motives and

769
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:35,080
the TTP's that they're actually using so

770
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:37,060
as a result of that you start to get

771
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,250
some new inspiration for changing your

772
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,590
TTP's and you also get calibration of

773
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:43,330
that so by partnering together you can

774
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:46,750
actually calibrate am i acting too much

775
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:48,790
like a red team or am i close enough to

776
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:51,820
what a threat actor might do if I'm off

777
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:53,379
running some TTP's that has never been

778
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,050
seen by a threat actor or never been

779
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,040
used rather by a threat actor maybe

780
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:59,320
you're a little far off the reservation

781
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:02,460
we need to bring you back into the fold

782
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,980
a little bit and recalibrate

783
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:08,200
recommendations typically a red team can

784
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,790
struggle with writing good solid

785
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,690
recommendations so if we pair those

786
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,430
together

787
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:15,700
with a blue team you can drive those

788
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:17,950
recommendations together you get some

789
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,750
some improved sharing and metrics so

790
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,730
blue team's typically have some form of

791
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:24,310
capability and growth measurement of

792
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:25,450
their operators of their teams some

793
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,570
people might call this the moral

794
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:30,100
equivalent of weapons qualifications

795
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:32,050
maybe you need to look at from a Red

796
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,850
Team perspective what your quality r

797
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,800
members are qualified to execute what

798
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:37,570
they're not so that they can grow in

799
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,629
addition to that you can for mutual

800
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:49,419
metrics with your blue team some quick

801
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:51,190
do's and don'ts some do's give the red

802
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:54,910
team some meaningful targets and don't

803
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:57,730
waste their talent so red team is a it

804
00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:00,580
really likes to be artists so don't bind

805
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:02,860
them into a very small box that says I

806
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:06,970
need you to emulate actor X and you can

807
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:09,270
only use actor X's specific TTP's give

808
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:12,040
them some room to breathe because

809
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:14,050
recognize one simple truth and that is

810
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,350
that an apt actor is a human being and

811
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:19,000
he's creative and a sentient being he

812
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:21,279
will not always present and project the

813
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,980
exact same way from incursion to

814
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,570
incursion especially over time so while

815
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,510
you want to cover down on a broad-based

816
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:30,910
tactic or technique there's a lot of

817
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:34,020
room inside of each of those to allow

818
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:35,739
freedom of movement for your red team

819
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,520
ensure that you're holding them

820
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:40,989
accountable to debrief their findings to

821
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,480
anybody and everybody who's responsible

822
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:48,669
for some set of actions related to those

823
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:51,190
findings do write your detection for a

824
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:53,590
blue team for their behaviors but do not

825
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:56,290
specifically try to actually find your

826
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:58,390
red team if you are off writing specific

827
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:00,970
IOC based detection for your red team

828
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:03,430
I'm going to suggest that maybe need to

829
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:05,080
rethink your strategy and your approach

830
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:08,020
and how you're actually defending your

831
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,680
environment because red team is not your

832
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,800
adversary

833
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,690
they're there to emulate your adversary

834
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,780
invite them into IR and hunt efforts one

835
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:18,430
of the fantastic greatest experiences

836
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,900
with the red team was I brought them

837
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,640
into response effort and I showed them

838
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,700
commands that are that an operator was

839
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:27,940
running and they looked that said

840
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,680
Aaron there's two operators there when I

841
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,589
looked at it I said how'd you know that

842
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,710
well their insight into how their

843
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:37,930
operation ran and how quickly and

844
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,609
effectively they run commands plus

845
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,399
evaluation of what those specific

846
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:44,348
commands were suggested to that Red Team

847
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,970
operator that there were two distinct

848
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:49,150
actors inside the same computer at the

849
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:50,919
same time using two different c2s it's a

850
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,450
really tremendous opportunity to not

851
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,280
only bring them into your response

852
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:57,460
efforts but also into a hunting effort

853
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:01,839
to help you with detection development

854
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:04,089
emulation exercises and finally you know

855
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,890
don't let them run the same TTP's for

856
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:08,440
six months and red teamers if you are

857
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:12,000
executing the same TTP's for six twelve

858
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:14,410
months please stop come up for air

859
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,180
you're probably not helping your

860
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:18,790
organization if you're doing that

861
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:21,339
because whatever you're doing is clearly

862
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:23,650
working especially if nobody's detecting

863
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:27,990
you and your organization actually needs

864
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:32,170
to adapt to those TTP's to cover down

865
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:34,450
words of warning and two things that I

866
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:36,940
think are probably the most important as

867
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,529
it relates to a red team as it relates

868
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:42,190
to a red team and the blue team

869
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:45,250
interaction one is this mantra of it's

870
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:47,440
just the red team how do you know if

871
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,420
you're a blue team maybe there are

872
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:56,589
specific TTP's that are exercised by a

873
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:58,000
red teamer maybe not but don't discard

874
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:01,950
what they do they're actually a defender

875
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,690
just like you and the blame culture

876
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:06,910
removing a blame culture that exists

877
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:08,530
that the red team is there to beat the

878
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:11,410
blue team that if you don't find them

879
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:13,329
you're failing and vice versa if I

880
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:15,910
caught you you're failing the blame

881
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:19,150
culture exists in both directions and

882
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:20,558
needs to be countered effectively so

883
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,750
every time you see this in your

884
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:25,829
environment in your organization seek to

885
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,829
squash this flat

886
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,940
now when we get to process process

887
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,649
confidence development of what it means

888
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,570
to actually blue team and environment or

889
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,820
defendant environment your process may

890
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:41,010
be look something like this you have an

891
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,810
intelligence team maybe they do some

892
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,850
collection they throw it into an Intel

893
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:47,520
platform maybe they form hypotheses if

894
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:50,850
it's behavior they shove that over to a

895
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,590
detection team or function that function

896
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,180
actually executes and runs through all

897
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:56,370
the TTP's runs through test deployment

898
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,649
pushes it into sensors and platforms and

899
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:00,600
on the other end of that you have a

900
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,400
responder and that responder is

901
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:06,210
responsible for running triage and and

902
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,460
the actual response effort itself and

903
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,410
maybe you have a hunt team or hunt

904
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,900
function also buried down in your

905
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,460
organization what I'm going to offer

906
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,700
here is really how do you know it's all

907
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:20,700
working all the time when you actually

908
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,290
dig in ask yourself some really critical

909
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,029
questions what's your defect rate on

910
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:26,130
endpoint sensors in your environment

911
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:28,800
odds are you're probably at 80%

912
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:33,930
effectiveness on your end points how

913
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:36,620
about your data platforms how well or

914
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:38,879
how reliable is that data feed coming in

915
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:43,200
how well structured is that information

916
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:46,200
how usable is it there are many many

917
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,149
gotchas in any single set of processes

918
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,299
that your team might run that require

919
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:53,370
really really super close evaluation to

920
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,260
know that you have confidence in the

921
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,680
execution of your process time in and

922
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,680
time out

923
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,629
red team's and blue team's have their

924
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:04,470
own sets of processes that they run in

925
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:06,030
cycles they can run this together you

926
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:09,089
can run a red team through the blue team

927
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:10,830
process and see and use that as a gauge

928
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:13,260
or an evaluation period for your team to

929
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:14,460
know where your where your periods of

930
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,020
slowdown are and where you're fast

931
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:20,120
enough so that you can actually start to

932
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:24,620
prioritize and process modification

933
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:26,819
process speed so we take CrowdStrike

934
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:29,970
threat actor breakout time this is a

935
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,620
time from entry to lateral movement by

936
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:33,480
country according to their evaluation

937
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:36,660
and then we take mandiant to dwell time

938
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:39,240
on the right hand side from there M

939
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:41,220
trends reporting a defender typically

940
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,890
has a hundred and one day meet

941
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,939
dwell time I means from the time

942
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,230
somebody enters into your environment

943
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,470
you're not going to detect it which

944
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:50,490
means your process does not start until

945
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:53,069
day 101-102

946
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:55,140
and if you're receiving external

947
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:57,000
notification from an agency you're

948
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:59,700
probably three maybe four months out

949
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,619
from the time of entry and from that

950
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:06,899
point that's where your process actually

951
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:10,319
starts so when we talk about speed does

952
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:12,390
your speed match parity with or does it

953
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,859
even come close to the speed of a thread

954
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:16,109
actor from that point of privilege

955
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:18,839
escalation or pivoting or lateral

956
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:21,869
movement now you have something to work

957
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:23,578
against you have a target you can take

958
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:27,480
your process and target it towards your

959
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:30,060
threat actor and this is just a gauge or

960
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,470
a guide to give you a basic level of

961
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,200
expectation for what you have to cover

962
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:36,270
down on and you can actually work your

963
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,950
process is to close that gap as much as

964
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:43,079
possible now before I get into this I

965
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:44,848
just want to give a quick shout out to a

966
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,579
couple of people who have done some

967
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:50,819
really tremendous work in this space I

968
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:53,369
am super excited to see what's out there

969
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:55,380
I think Rodrigo's here for if I'm not

970
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:58,260
mistaken a couple of the other guys may

971
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,300
be or not but the dragos team I think

972
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:04,050
Joe is probably here if I'm not mistaken

973
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:06,030
as well so big shout out to the four

974
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,710
folks there that run these projects or

975
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:12,630
have written these papers on this this

976
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:14,310
topic this is super super critical in

977
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,319
any given environment there are five

978
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,839
defensive elements that center around

979
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,589
these categorical areas of endpoint

980
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:25,170
network identity application and data an

981
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:27,180
actor needs to actually secure or gain

982
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:30,540
entrance into some form of all five of

983
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:32,399
these if they're let's say objective is

984
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,750
to steal that information or steal

985
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,300
intellectual property something to that

986
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:38,880
effect and so evaluation of these needs

987
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,430
to be run against each ecosystem for

988
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,619
each target using each of those

989
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:47,160
defensive elements so if there's any way

990
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:50,069
to to merge some of these projects guys

991
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,500
I would encourage everybody who's a

992
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:54,150
participant in this space merge these

993
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,750
kind of concepts together

994
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,870
there's

995
00:41:54,750 --> 00:42:00,830
maybe room for a framework that

996
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:05,480
describes multiple different forms of

997
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:07,890
coverage and coverage confidence and

998
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,530
ecosystem visibility as it relates to

999
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:12,779
each ecosystem you have maybe a matrix

1000
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,580
right endpoints talking to endpoints and

1001
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,920
points in isolation

1002
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:19,380
the relationship between an identity and

1003
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,180
a network such and such as you see the

1004
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,710
the different points here each one of

1005
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,839
these represents maybe the form of a

1006
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:27,870
micro parameter where perimeters offer

1007
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,550
you a position of visibility so as it

1008
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,960
relates to each of those ecosystems on

1009
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:34,950
the right hand side you can evaluate

1010
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,530
your points of visibility and a word of

1011
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:40,529
caution typically this is what you'll

1012
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:42,810
see in organizations that we focus very

1013
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:46,380
very heavily on endpoint and network and

1014
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:49,080
moving forward in time those two become

1015
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:51,000
less and less important and maybe you'll

1016
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,529
see more in the identity and application

1017
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,470
space as it relates to you let's say a

1018
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:57,960
cloud environment or other server list

1019
00:42:55,470 --> 00:43:01,439
type environments where networks and

1020
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:05,940
endpoints don't truly exist so consider

1021
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,960
where you you place on that matrix let

1022
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:12,690
me speed up here guys actually sorry a

1023
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,920
simplified workbook so again I'm not

1024
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:16,590
going to repeat what other folks have

1025
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,300
done in this space but here's maybe a

1026
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:21,030
different view of it a different way to

1027
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,200
consider it different concept that if

1028
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,880
you take in this framework and those

1029
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:28,439
defensive elements against your targets

1030
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:30,090
you can evaluate them thusly so do I

1031
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,550
have collection do I have detection do I

1032
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:34,530
know how to respond that would map

1033
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:36,840
nicely to your compliance folks may be a

1034
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,340
risk folks as well and you can assign a

1035
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,500
simple scoring system or a complex

1036
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,430
scoring system the scoring system itself

1037
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,090
is not the point here

1038
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:46,890
only that you actually develop one so

1039
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:48,990
the folks that I mentioned before have

1040
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:53,040
an a series of scoring systems that they

1041
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:55,709
they've discussed in public so with that

1042
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,700
in mind you look to combine and create

1043
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:01,080
maybe a Best of Breed

1044
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:05,339
option here between these examples so in

1045
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:06,600
closing we started off talking about

1046
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,250
good versus evil

1047
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,190
just remember

1048
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:14,160
towards the end of Star Wars the evil

1049
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:18,060
guy woke up and through the super bad

1050
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:20,370
guy into the tunnel and he exploded only

1051
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:23,700
to come back right as we look ahead to

1052
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:25,350
the next Star Wars it's anticipated that

1053
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:28,290
he will come back well your threat

1054
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:30,900
actors will come back too so that

1055
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:34,350
partnership between red and blue must

1056
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,850
exist seek to close any gaps that exist

1057
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:38,450
in your organization as relates to those

1058
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:40,860
two parts of the organization together

1059
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,450
bring them together and in final

1060
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,920
thoughts

1061
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:46,200
look consider your perspectives derive a

1062
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,350
new insight you know are you the but

1063
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:52,080
with the wig or are you seeing a big

1064
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:55,009
picture focus on your targets and

1065
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,970
satisfying the needs of your network

1066
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:59,220
evaluate the who versus how and

1067
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:01,109
understand the relationship and where to

1068
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,180
draw the line before you go down the

1069
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:05,370
rabbit hole of evaluating the who for

1070
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,470
the sake of evaluating the who it's a

1071
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:10,400
pitfall for almost every intelligence

1072
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:12,870
team as it relates to attribution if

1073
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,610
you're a blue team or a defensive

1074
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:17,069
organization be candid about your

1075
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,180
capabilities it satisfies nobody and it

1076
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:21,840
helps no one

1077
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:23,730
really if you are untruthful about the

1078
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,660
actual capabilities that you have and

1079
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:28,800
learn to partner with your red team's

1080
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:32,730
and let me leave you with two final

1081
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,710
thoughts one somebody will be out there

1082
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,960
trying to steal and drink your water

1083
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:40,140
especially if you are too busy arguing

1084
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,510
over the state of it so again put the

1085
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:44,580
arguments aside and remember that you're

1086
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:46,470
up against a thread actor that you have

1087
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,690
in common you both work for the same

1088
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:51,419
organization most likely or you're

1089
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:54,770
contracting for a customer and therefore

1090
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:57,600
you're serving that customer and in

1091
00:45:54,770 --> 00:46:00,870
final thoughts final final thoughts now

1092
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:05,190
what I give you is a story a couple days

1093
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:08,569
ago as at a coffee shop and I walked up

1094
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:11,550
unaware of everything going on and the

1095
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:15,120
barista said here here's the coffee that

1096
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:16,560
you ordered and said no charge I thought

1097
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,690
wait a minute no charge how did that

1098
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,950
happen I I'm here I've got my money and

1099
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:21,560
they said well this person over here

1100
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:24,220
paid for you

1101
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:27,140
and they took care of it for you so that

1102
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:30,620
for me was a life lesson it's happened a

1103
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:32,960
couple times I try to give back every

1104
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:35,630
time that this occurs I mean then on my

1105
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,870
own but really we have a next generation

1106
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:41,990
following us we are all part of the same

1107
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:44,120
generation doing this type of work by

1108
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:47,419
somebody else of coffee share their

1109
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:49,400
story hear their story grow together and

1110
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,260
work together because we both and we all

1111
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,680
have a common thread and that thread

1112
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:57,260
that binds us is our threat we are here

1113
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:01,490
to defend against our threat actors and

1114
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:02,450
we do that together so thank you have a

1115
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:04,069
great conference

1116
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:07,589

1117
