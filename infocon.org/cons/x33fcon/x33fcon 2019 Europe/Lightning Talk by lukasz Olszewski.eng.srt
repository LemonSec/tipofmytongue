1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:15,450
thank you guys can you hear me all right

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,720
because okay I will try to speak quite

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,299
loud all right so my name is Waukesha

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,330
seski I work in Atos I'm leading scissor

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,869
threat intelligence and EDR there so

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,179
this is like my day job but the other

7
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,030
part of my engagement in autos is

8
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,070
related to this small circle that I

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,489
actually wanted to mentioned to mention

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:43,200
here it's it's called we have a thing

11
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:45,390
called APIs experts community and this

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,760
is the place where like where I can also

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:54,300
let's say few things that that interests

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,390
me and that are not necessarily part of

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,260
my daily routine so so we have also a

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,629
place for research for development and

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,970
this will be also related to to to to

18
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,399
the to the stuff that I want to talk to

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,400
you about today so the the topic of my

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,810
presentation is data science and

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,450
orchestration in service to cyber

22
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,820
security breach detection and response

23
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:21,540
so I would like I would like to talk to

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,039
you talk to you about what we were what

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,979
we have been doing in at us for the last

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,570
one year exactly this area so how to

27
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:33,960
improve detection and how to improve

28
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:35,369
response basically and mostly using the

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,729
things and the data that we already

30
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,560
collect for ourselves for our customers

31
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:44,820
and hopefully this will the short talk

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,770
will will inspire you maybe also to look

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,960
for for similar improvements in in your

34
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,449
environments it's not related to any

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,820
specific product right so so there is

36
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,579
couple of services that we needed to to

37
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,419
orchestrate together so yeah so let's

38
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:03,419
start I will start with this quote he

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,990
said that the CEO of fire I he said that

40
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,568
at this this year at RSA Conference and

41
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:11,790
I realize the risk of saying such a

42
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:14,359
thing at a conference like this one

43
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,579
where we have a lot of red teamers

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,370
but the matter of the fact is that I've

45
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,290
also that I shared this view right I

46
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:26,420
have a feeling that being a blue team

47
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:28,670
and myself I did a bit also I did work a

48
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,750
bit in the area of red teaming but I do

49
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:34,700
have this this impression that we sort

50
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,670
of need to be as blue teamers we sort of

51
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,730
need to be right all the time right and

52
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,829
the guys who are attacking us well not

53
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,660
necessarily sometimes it's it's it's

54
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:49,070
okay if they are if there are right

55
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:51,109
justice justice one time so this sort of

56
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:58,280
sets the stage for this presentation and

57
00:02:51,110 --> 00:03:01,580
why and why we decided to do something

58
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,290
about about about this and and and to

59
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,900
and to see for the for the improvement

60
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:09,200
so obviously cybersecurity is a process

61
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,900
right so the last year we were doing the

62
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,600
things that I will discuss now next year

63
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,250
this year this will be this would be

64
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:22,690
something something completely else so

65
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:25,850
why do we even need to what pushed us

66
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,829
into into into this direction to look

67
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,239
for improvements in this area first

68
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,330
there is no perfect security measure

69
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,970
right I mean all of those measures that

70
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,610
we implement at some point they fail and

71
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,670
the worst thing is that many of them

72
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,640
will fail silently right so if they fail

73
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,679
to detect an attack good luck looking

74
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,929
for you know any kind of information

75
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,630
later in the forensic stage in the in

76
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:54,709
the response stage about what happens

77
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,930
right good good example here here is and

78
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:00,019
you know signature by say ve or or or I

79
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:02,090
or ideas so this if they fail to detect

80
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:04,130
a threat they will provide you very

81
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,560
little information I thought would

82
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,470
happen later the alert fatigue something

83
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,470
that we experience very very hard in

84
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,140
Atos we we work for many customers and

85
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,668
we work also internally for ourselves

86
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,820
and this is a huge problem in sauk right

87
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:23,630
so so they deal with tons of events from

88
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:26,120
tons of information security systems and

89
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,420
and it's also a problem that that we

90
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,600
wanted to solve

91
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,430
here then the time there is well we need

92
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,580
a lot of time to do everything first to

93
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:38,790
understand them to respond to take a

94
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,000
decision and to implement response

95
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,580
actions right the other issue that we

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,610
need to address is that the manual

97
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,090
processes that we follow in that are

98
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,470
usually followed in traditional socks

99
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,450
they are prone to human errors right so

100
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,130
even if you prepare this nice work

101
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,370
instruction that says everything you

102
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:01,380
know line by wine line by line how to do

103
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,210
something in a given system how to open

104
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,659
a ticket how to you know block a domain

105
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,640
whatever I mean people will forget

106
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,650
things right maybe something will not

107
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,020
work the first time they will experience

108
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,760
some kind of an error they will decide

109
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,919
to do it later and later die we simply

110
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,330
forget right so mistakes happens happen

111
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,170
then they inside the threads so this is

112
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:27,120
the the completely other animal because

113
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,800
if we have users inside of the

114
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,600
environment as you know they will

115
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
usually use the level of access they

116
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,980
already have the tools they already have

117
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:40,049
to to cause us harm and the only thing

118
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,700
that that can change or potentially will

119
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,690
change in such a situation is basically

120
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,670
the behavior profile of such a user and

121
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,590
the last one is not actually a problem

122
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,630
that was that we wanted to solve this is

123
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,599
actually an opportunity that I mentioned

124
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,719
at the beginning right so a lot of the

125
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:02,610
data that we need is already available

126
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:04,530
we just lack technical capabilities to

127
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:08,130
actually do something about that in an

128
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:10,650
efficient manner so what was the goal

129
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,260
the goal was that to basically change

130
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,210
this legacy traditional sock approach

131
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,390
when we have you know Sima log we

132
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,280
collect logs we have correlation rules

133
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,900
we have the sim that aggregates logs

134
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,940
home systems but also others from other

135
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:30,359
security measures and we wanted to or we

136
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:34,260
created what basically we added some

137
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:37,860
things on top of that right so we wanted

138
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:41,250
to improve detection by going into user

139
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,670
behavior analytics and to detect changes

140
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,590
in user behavior profiles and most of

141
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,600
all we also wanted to address this

142
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,969
decision support and response issues

143
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,890
right to be able to respond quickly and

144
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:58,170
to avoid human errors and preferably for

145
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:01,530
those you know like play books that we

146
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:04,320
have that are solved by the analysts at

147
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:07,469
the same time each time given incident

148
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,060
or or even happens we want to automate

149
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:13,110
them all together right from the

150
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,600
beginning to D to the end so what would

151
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,820
what do we need to look at to solve this

152
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,200
so this is the the Goodall attack till

153
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:25,560
chain that that you all already know so

154
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:28,229
on the blue team side what we need to be

155
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,900
able to track the attackers throughout

156
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,980
this kill chain our alerts right of

157
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,900
course there is more there is threat

158
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,660
hunting there is forensic stuff but on

159
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,239
the first layer its alert right and we

160
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,730
have a lot of different solutions that

161
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,920
generate alerts and what we are doing in

162
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:47,070
scope of what we've done in scope of

163
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:50,040
this improvement we if we add that one

164
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:52,290
more right so this doesn't believe this

165
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,630
will help to detect better but it

166
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:57,090
doesn't solve the the issue with alert

167
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,130
fatigue right and then it gets more

168
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,900
complicated we also need the contexts

169
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,969
right so the insights we need to

170
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,070
understand who the user is

171
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,110
so we into access different systems to

172
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,790
get this information about the asset

173
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,250
about the user about the entity right

174
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,950
and again multiple sources for context

175
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:17,070
then there is a decision to be made and

176
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:19,860
and again there are multiple possible

177
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:23,210
decisions and it may be simple in a one

178
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,980
in one organization but when we as

179
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,830
artists we face multiple environments

180
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:31,830
many customers this gets more

181
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:36,289
complicated because you just add next

182
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:38,968
boxes into those columns and finally

183
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,530
when you detected the alert you have all

184
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:41,910
the insight you investigate that you

185
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,339
gathered all the events you need to take

186
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,790
the remediation steps or or to respond

187
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,890
somehow

188
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,730
and again there will be multiple

189
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,949
security

190
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,670
multiple systems where response actions

191
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:56,010
are possible on and again there will be

192
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,779
multiple response actions and if you

193
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,860
multiply this by different environments

194
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:03,510
for different customers it gets extra

195
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,160
extra complicated so this is the whole

196
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,699
picture that we need to look at if you

197
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,339
want to solve this hassle so to talk

198
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:13,349
about this small little box that we

199
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,510
added in the leading part so the user

200
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:20,399
behavior analytics the Oba what we do

201
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:22,730
here is we work on the source data and

202
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,670
the source data what we started with is

203
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:29,190
originally were basically the Active

204
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,680
Directory or the event logs from domain

205
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,930
controllers in the active Active

206
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,180
Directory environment and even logs from

207
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:39,510
servers right so this was giving us the

208
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,519
initial set of events and data that we

209
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,160
already had in the same systems for us

210
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,930
for our customers that we could use to

211
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,699
develop scenarios like that I selected

212
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,638
for here we have we have much much more

213
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:53,550
right now but just to give you an idea

214
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,920
about about the things that we are

215
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,170
targeting here right and I will discuss

216
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,769
two of them in a bit more detail in a

217
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:03,719
second so this part is good because it

218
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:06,300
will give us another capabilities to

219
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,240
detect anomalies in the behavior of an

220
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:12,300
entity right of the user asset whatever

221
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,100
but again we are just what we are doing

222
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,319
here we are just adding more sources of

223
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,959
alerts so what is crucial is this right

224
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:21,089
part in this right part we want to be

225
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,518
sure that we are able to aggregate all

226
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:26,550
those detection all those insights in

227
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,130
one single place and that we get those

228
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,319
insights automatically for a given case

229
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:34,550
for the analyst so when the analyst

230
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:37,829
actually touches the event they can see

231
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:40,199
what actually happened right and this is

232
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:43,019
just the first example I selected the

233
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:45,990
simplest one that we that we that we had

234
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,959
and it is about quantities right so it's

235
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,720
it basically aims to detect the changes

236
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,709
in the quantity of events generated for

237
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,110
a given user or host and it's simple but

238
00:10:55,709 --> 00:11:00,959
if you want to tackle this with a with a

239
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,560
traditional sim system and you want to

240
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,498
be able

241
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,138
to detect only anomalies for a single

242
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:08,370
entity so let's say if I generate a lot

243
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:11,279
of events on Fridays

244
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,350
then if fine I don't want to be alerted

245
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,709
about that right and I want to to look

246
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,689
at 90 days window so in traditional

247
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,489
seems to be able to focus on a single

248
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:22,469
entity let the patter for the single

249
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,920
entity if you have like 100,000 users

250
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:28,589
for 90 days is very challenging so this

251
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,930
is where we implement implemented our

252
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:34,379
solutions and and big data analytics for

253
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:37,709
that the other one a bit more a bit more

254
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:39,990
fun is related to cost access anomaly

255
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:42,138
detection and we have basically like two

256
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:45,720
such scenarios here one is related to

257
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:47,519
detecting a let's say abnormalities in

258
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,730
the number of hosts given user is

259
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:54,720
accessing is logging on to remotely or

260
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:56,999
if the given user is accessing hosts he

261
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,420
or she has never accessed before right

262
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:02,160
so this is this is another example where

263
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:06,959
we do it and again we are working here

264
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,490
on ninety days windows so very quickly

265
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,170
to give you the idea how the

266
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,329
proof-of-concept environment looked like

267
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:15,569
for us when we were working on this we

268
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:18,449
had I don't have a laser pointer but in

269
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:19,949
the in the left bottom corner we have

270
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:23,609
their context for security so this is

271
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:25,378
the part that does the machine learning

272
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,329
and the big data analytics stuff so act

273
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,430
context was a product of Atos or is a

274
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:33,000
product of autos that was used for

275
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,529
financial data analysis and we figured

276
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,149
out we can use this also for security

277
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:41,759
and what it does is it it's it's the

278
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:43,559
source of this ubi alerts and in the

279
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,569
center as you can see we have we have

280
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,129
the soil that has all the play books

281
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:48,870
that we developed and all the stuff and

282
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:51,269
that is responsible for the

283
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:54,300
orchestration so what happens if we have

284
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:56,339
you know a common scenario of of an

285
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,979
attacker stealing credentials and

286
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,499
performing lateral movement is we can

287
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,519
get a detection well one of the Texans

288
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:04,649
or multiple detections

289
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:09,480
in the UPA for instance the one related

290
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:11,429
to two to the access host anomaly this

291
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,529
will trigger the soil and the soil tool

292
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:15,350
for that entity for that particular user

293
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:17,689
or host it will query

294
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,880
the system it will query the same so no

295
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,860
no need to duplicate the same data here

296
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,110
it will query our threat intelligence

297
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,030
database mystery in this case the domain

298
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,920
controller so collected this insight

299
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:32,900
about this user if there were any

300
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:35,900
incidents in the past for this user if

301
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,030
there are if there were other alerts

302
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,890
from other security systems that fit to

303
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,930
the theme for the same user so we want

304
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,699
to know if we have the ubi detection we

305
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,380
want to know if we have maybe the IDR

306
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,440
detection as well from cran striking

307
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:50,090
this case or if we have any correlation

308
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,660
rules triggering for the same user in

309
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:55,760
the same period of time for for this

310
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,370
entity and all of that happens before

311
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,250
the human analyst is involved right so

312
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,440
once we have this 360 view ready this is

313
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,420
the first time we will go to sock to

314
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,580
tyre one tyre to so they can look at

315
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,650
that they can investigate they can see

316
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,410
all the events all the contexts that we

317
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:14,860
have available for this user and make a

318
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,140
decision and when they make a decision

319
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:20,270
then they can they can escalate they can

320
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:24,920
inform the customer by power bi in this

321
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:26,990
case and they can basically click to to

322
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,290
automate or to perform all those

323
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,280
possible response actions so did

324
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,569
malicious emails if you were talking

325
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,939
about phishing as the initial vector

326
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,430
lock user account may be contain a

327
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,750
hosting CrowdStrike

328
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:41,270
transfer the indicators of compromised

329
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,910
domain to miss so we can be sure that we

330
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:45,590
have another fire up like that we can

331
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,050
connect this to that the case that was

332
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:54,950
already investigated right so to

333
00:14:48,050 --> 00:15:00,140
summarize the last slide here this was

334
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:02,150
our our way to go from this from this

335
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,790
reactive security too prescriptive

336
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:06,949
security so we are able for those cases

337
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,839
that we are that we defined we are able

338
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:14,690
to tell exactly what needs to be done

339
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:17,090
and do it in a lot more automated way so

340
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:19,610
we can avoid common mistakes human

341
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:23,630
errors and we can respond much faster

342
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:26,300
and most of all when we work in this

343
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:29,180
scenario the stock analysts if they are

344
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,920
believed on of performing all

345
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,719
those searches of performing all those

346
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,680
manual actions you know to block URLs

347
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,510
stuff that they do many times every week

348
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,000
this is really acute relief for them and

349
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,520
to and they can be involved in other

350
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,060
tasks like like threat hunting or or

351
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,030
what-have-you

352
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,890
right and most of all a lot of this is

353
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,500
based on the data that we already have

354
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,360
right so we started simply with with the

355
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,820
logs event logs from the main controller

356
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,370
servers that we had already collected in

357
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:02,300
the same systems anyway so this is just

358
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:05,180
an improvement of investment in this in

359
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:10,150
this category okay suddenly it's a very

360
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:14,630
quick 150 minutes and I can already feel

361
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:16,699
on me so this is not my site thank you

362
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:22,480
very much I'm not sure if I have time

363
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:22,480
for questions or not Thank You Akash

364
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,790
you
