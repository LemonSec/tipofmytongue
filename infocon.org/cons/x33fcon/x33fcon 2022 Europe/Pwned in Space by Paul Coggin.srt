00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,480
[Music]

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,480
so i'm paul coggin

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,519
i'm from huntsville alabama in the u.s

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,599
and so this this presentation we're

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,200
going to

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,480
dive into

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,119
a broad broad

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,760
set of topics related to space and cyber

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
security

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,080
we start talking about space

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,720
one of the key components is the ground

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,920
systems

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,000
think of a ground system

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,040
as

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,440
the kind of like your knock or your sock

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,440
in your enterprise network where you

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
manage your your

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,120
your enterprise network infrastructure

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,879
with a similar with uh

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,920
space systems they have ground stations

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,399
that will be spread out across the world

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,640
so that you have visibility

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,440
no matter what where your assets are in

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,399
orbit

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,920
you have visibility and you can

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,079
communicate with your assets and you can

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,480
download information from the

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,519
from the payload as well as be able to

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,840
send commands to the payload and to the

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,240
spacecraft itself and in this example

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,920
we're showing

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,000
a ground station network for nasa

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,600
but other uh

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,360
other space systems constellations will

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,280
have

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,479
a ground station network similar to this

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,439
but

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,880
the big trend

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,280
everyone's talking about uh public cloud

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,119
these days well also with space space is

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,680
utilizing the public cloud there's a

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,520
leaf space out of italy

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,400
uh

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,799
kubos who's got a application called

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,560
major tom that is hosted in amazon aws

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,759
amazon

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,399
is offering space ground station

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,079
services in the cloud where you can

49
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,119
outsource

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,759
the ground station to amazon

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,840
where they have the antennas spread

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,759
across geographic locations their data

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,680
centers so that you don't have to go

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,560
build

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
a large ground station network you can

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,880
just outsource to them microsoft azure

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,439
has their orbit service as well

58
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,720
and my understanding is google is

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,160
doing similarly for spacex starlings

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,599
project so

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,200
space is moving to the cloud so

62
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,879
inspect and

63
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,040
and also similarly

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,879
it's not real surprising

65
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,560
that that uh

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,640
space providers are using infrastructure

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,319
in the public cloud but what really

68
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,400
surprised me as i started

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,080
digging into

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,120
space technologies is that space has

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,040
actually moved that

72
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,879
that cloud is actually moving to space

73
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,120
in some cases where

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,840
vendors such as uh leo cloud

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
new startups like leo cloud are actually

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,959
going to put cloud infrastructure on on

77
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,879
their satellites in space

78
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,519
uh so that

79
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,080
the uh say the image processing that is

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,519
happening in space whereas all kinds of

81
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,000
imaging and data being gathered can be

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,560
pre-processed in space and then sent

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,879
back down to earth as needed instead of

84
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,560
having to send everything they're going

85
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,599
to have

86
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,200
data center capabilities in space to

87
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
provide all kinds of different services

88
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,120
which is going to generate a lot of

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,760
interesting scenarios and questions for

90
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,159
the cyber security industry with all

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,760
those assets going up into space

92
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,360
uh something i was going to make aware

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,120
of a big problem with uh with space is

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,920
there is radiation i'm going to go

95
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,519
deeper into this

96
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,599
and

97
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,040
so there's companies that are coming out

98
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,200
with new technologies to support the

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,680
data centers moving to space with uh

100
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
like rahman out of

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,840
israel who's created like a terabyte

102
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,000
hard drive that's hardened for the harsh

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
environment of space so this is that

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,280
this is

105
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
this market is really developing quickly

106
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,439
to support this and what really got my

107
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,120
attention here recently as i was

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,760
preparing this presentation

109
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,799
is uh

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,640
there also now there's a startup is

111
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,200
looking at actually putting data centers

112
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,159
on the moon in uh

113
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,680
lava tunnels

114
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,599
possibly on the moon so that's gonna

115
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,879
so

116
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,400
so the cloud is definitely moving to

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,599
space quickly

118
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,839
and there's one more example

119
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,880
of ntt by a tele telecommunications

120
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
company out of japan

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
and they're they're planning on building

122
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
a constellation and the different

123
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,600
satellites will have storage

124
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,919
capabilities similar to

125
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,040
your data center on on earth

126
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,320
but they're going to have that on their

127
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,680
satellites and then they're going to be

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,720
interconnected there's going to be a

129
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,120
large network interconnected with lasers

130
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
uh free space optics

131
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,479
so it's gonna be a large network just

132
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,759
like what we have here on the ground but

133
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,160
it's always gonna be up in space so this

134
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,960
is quick this market is quickly evolving

135
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,880
and then it goes like i said it's gonna

136
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,199
bring in a lot of new questions about

137
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,400
cyber security

138
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,840
you know how are we going to deal with

139
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,560
incident response forensics

140
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,039
recovery denial of service

141
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,000
lots of different scenarios uh as all of

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,840
those networks that we're used to being

143
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,400
having on the ground or moving up up to

144
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
space

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,720
now when we get into space

146
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,440
depending on the application

147
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,479
it could be running the satellites like

148
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,840
oneweb

149
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,479
the spacex starlink

150
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,000
those those satellites are typically

151
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,360
running at leo in a low earth orbit

152
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,160
now your cable tv

153
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,880
and a lot of your telecommunications

154
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,120
satellites are typically in geo where in

155
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,440
leo those satellites are in low earth

156
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,320
orbit

157
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,680
they're they're revolving around the

158
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,560
earth around about every four hours

159
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
they're they're making a

160
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,720
an orbit around the earth with geo those

161
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,680
satellites are fixed and their they're

162
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,479
pinpointed they're pointed to follow the

163
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,080
earth's rotation so they're always

164
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,000
pointing at the same place on the earth

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,160
with your geos that's that we're very

166
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
familiar with for telecommunications but

167
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,680
what you're hearing about in the news so

168
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,639
much lately is with one web and spacex

169
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,880
etc is the leo orbits

170
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,319
now

171
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,840
from a threat standpoint from a cyber

172
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
security and

173
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,280
just physical kinetic threats the

174
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,199
the american scientists the federation

175
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,039
of american scientists have defined

176
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,000
like five major categories of threats to

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,319
space you have deception where you know

178
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,319
someone's uh going to mess with you

179
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,479
think about like spoofing gps there's a

180
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,360
lot of

181
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,039
information out there now in the news

182
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,479
about ais information that the ships use

183
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,680
to know their location gps gnss here in

184
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,120
europe uh being spoofed

185
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,800
temporary disruption maybe like

186
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,960
electronic warfare where someone turns

187
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,639
on a

188
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,599
a radio frequency jammer where the

189
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,680
signal is jammed temporarily as soon as

190
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,360
the power is removed

191
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,919
the signal is restored

192
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,759
that would you know some disruption or

193
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,960
it could be that there's a denial

194
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,880
of service where someone goes and

195
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,280
saturates the link somehow uh and then

196
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,720
the degradation could be they maybe

197
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,599
they're

198
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,360
using a laser or something

199
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,400
uh

200
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,479
to uh that's actually damaged the

201
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,080
satellite

202
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
in um

203
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,440
you know or complete destruction because

204
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,479
there's been a lot of that in the news

205
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,479
lately like a missile test against the

206
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,400
satellite to blow the satellite up and

207
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,319
then creates a debris field which

208
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,919
creates the concern of what we call

209
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,400
kessler syndrome where there could be a

210
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,199
chain reaction of debris hitting debris

211
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,199
or other space assets and it causes the

212
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,360
chain reaction to work to the point that

213
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,280
uh space is no longer usable because of

214
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,840
the debris field

215
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,639
in some of the threads some of them are

216
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,919
reversible like i was mentioning the

217
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,000
electronic warfare you turn on the

218
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,720
signal you turn on the jammer

219
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,280
it and it affects the system you remove

220
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,440
the power and it'll go away all the way

221
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,280
to uh

222
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,120
to threats like a

223
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,199
missile hitting a

224
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,440
a rocket and blowing it up and though in

225
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,680
that case it would be non-reversible and

226
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
then with cyber

227
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,360
it could be reversible or non-reversible

228
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,000
depending on the type of attack but but

229
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,759
speaking of the non-reversable just

230
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,840
wanted to as i was researching this i

231
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,400
wanted to bring this out

232
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,800
of some example examples of some kinetic

233
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,360
attacks back in the 70s

234
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,960
i thought it was interesting to learn

235
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,400
that in the 70s one the space station

236
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,360
alma

237
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,440
that the soviet union had actually had a

238
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,479
machine gun on it a cannon 23 millimeter

239
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,519
cannon i thought that was really

240
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,000
interested and there's there's talk

241
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,839
about you know war in space a lot these

242
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,000
days well this is a satellite that's a

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,760
french are looking at a building that's

244
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
actually going to either have a

245
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,560
submachine gun or lasers on it so it's

246
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,440
really interesting but

247
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,279
uh but we're talking about

248
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,839
focusing on cyber security for this talk

249
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,279
uh and with the cyber security the

250
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,880
issues we're looking at are jamming

251
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,080
which is gonna be like electronic

252
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,000
warfare it's gonna be your radio

253
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,160
frequency malware we'll get into some

254
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,560
examples of malware in space spoofing we

255
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,279
mentioned earlier like gps and gnss

256
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,760
spoofing the timing capability gps

257
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,399
capability

258
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,600
your

259
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,160
the control system for the satellite

260
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
targeting the payload system for the

261
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,320
satellite maybe uh hi hacking

262
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,680
eavesdropping

263
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,399
and eavesdropping uh it's easier to do

264
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,560
than you may realize because a lot

265
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,000
we have a lot of examples of this a lot

266
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,160
of a lot of the satellite communications

267
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,800
are not encrypted though we assume it's

268
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,399
encrypted it's not

269
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,839
uh

270
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,360
in many many cases it's not and we'll

271
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,440
give a lot of examples

272
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,360
and so so you know from a threat

273
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,800
standpoint there's a lot of different

274
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,720
threats we could be a nation state it

275
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,120
could be military it could be intel

276
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
uh they're going to have you know a lot

277
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,560
more sophisticated capabilities to come

278
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,320
at your system with

279
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,920
and then

280
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
all the all the way down to a more

281
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,320
unsophisticated users that may be just

282
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,680
eavesdropping

283
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,839
it doesn't it doesn't take a whole lot

284
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:06,800
of

285
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,120
funding to go get a cup go get to get

286
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
the equipment needed to just passively

287
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,920
eavesdrop on unencrypted uh satellite

288
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,319
traffic

289
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,399
now when i talk about

290
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,480
uh cyber security problems especially

291
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,240
from an offensive standpoint i like to

292
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,720
do uh tag trees

293
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,920
so

294
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
real real high level strategy for the

295
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,000
attack tree might be to go

296
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,839
if you're looking at somebody's going

297
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,600
after a satellite system might be to go

298
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,000
after the ground station as an insider

299
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,519
threat or try to figure out how to

300
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,160
get through the vpn firewall like in the

301
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,959
case of what happened with viasat here

302
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,440
recently somebody got into the ground

303
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,680
the ground system they controlled the

304
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
user terminals

305
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,600
then there's a scenario of

306
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,880
sat to set

307
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
that right now everything i can see with

308
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,160
sat to sat

309
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,399
is all theoretical nothing there's

310
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,000
nothing that i've been able to read out

311
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,240
in the press no books or papers

312
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,959
uh that go into real world examples of

313
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,399
sad to say but it's probably something

314
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,079
that we'll see in the future

315
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,839
and uh there's the possibility

316
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,360
especially with the lack of strong

317
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,279
encryption it could be that someone

318
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,440
could go and stand up their own ground

319
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,000
station and try to communicate with your

320
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,040
satellite

321
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,839
if they if they have the resources

322
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,760
and

323
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,640
so so here's an example you know back a

324
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,760
few years ago everybody was talking

325
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,480
about stux and as i was working on uh

326
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,839
doing this research i found it really

327
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,920
interesting that apparently at uh black

328
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,000
hat someone uh published

329
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,480
that not only did stuxnet uh go and

330
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,399
spread

331
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,640
around the around the globe but it also

332
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,320
apparently was able to affect a

333
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,440
satellite

334
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,320
for a cable tv operator in india for the

335
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,839
inside 4b

336
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,040
satellite

337
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,720
apparently somehow

338
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,120
the stuxxer malware got into the ground

339
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,560
station

340
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,920
and was able to go and spread to to the

341
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,240
inside 4b satellite and what i gather

342
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,560
looking researching online

343
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,600
is it

344
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,279
appears that the siemens plc might have

345
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,560
been used to control the

346
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
solar panels on the satellite and so it

347
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,000
was able to

348
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
that malware was able to disable the

349
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
satellite so that it no longer responded

350
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,959
and then the cable tv company in india

351
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,040
it is said uh lost their satellite

352
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,200
because of that because of uh the solar

353
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,000
panels no longer responded

354
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,519
so that's one issue now

355
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,680
this is the this is all in the news here

356
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,399
lately about the solar storms coming

357
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,079
from the sun

358
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,680
there's all these cosmic rays that are

359
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,040
coming out of the sun with protons and

360
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,399
ions

361
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,360
that are

362
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,279
come that are headed toward the earth

363
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,800
they can

364
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
cause all kinds of disruptions with the

365
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,279
power grid i read an article where up in

366
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,320
uh up here in northern uh europe uh that

367
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,399
there was problems with with some train

368
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,800
stations where the solar storms were

369
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,040
sending uh so much uh

370
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,560
so many particles

371
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,160
to the earth

372
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,839
that it was causing disruption with the

373
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,800
trains

374
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,959
with the signaling where there may not

375
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,360
be a train on the tracks

376
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,680
but because of the particles the ions

377
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,600
being sent to the earth from the sun it

378
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
was causing the signaling to believe

379
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,200
that there was actually a train on the

380
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
tracks when there wasn't

381
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,279
but uh but it could cause all kinds of

382
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,839
disruptions all this uh

383
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,920
these particles coming in from the sun

384
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,040
especially in space and i've kind of uh

385
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,560
termed it uh

386
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
einstein denial of surface because

387
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,399
that's what e equal m c square his

388
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,519
equation

389
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,040
he's so famous for

390
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,079
is defined for is to define the energy

391
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,440
of the mass

392
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
in the speed which is the speed of light

393
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,399
square

394
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,639
of the particles that are heading out

395
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,279
into the solar system sourced from the

396
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,519
sun

397
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,279
now this

398
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,000
these uh solar storms these cosmic rays

399
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,399
these ions and particles that are

400
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,279
flying through space that's reason

401
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,320
that

402
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,800
a lot of the spacecraft are not using

403
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,240
encryption because if they if because if

404
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,320
they want to use encryption

405
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,639
whoever the designers the manufacturers

406
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,720
of the spacecraft would have to go use

407
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,560
radiation hardened equipment they would

408
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,240
have to spend a lot more money

409
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,480
hardening that equipment to survive the

410
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,639
hostile environment of space and the

411
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,040
last thing you want to do is put a

412
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,279
satellite in space or spacecraft in

413
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,600
space you didn't spend the money up

414
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,639
front to get it hardened against

415
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,800
the radiation and all the particles that

416
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,240
are getting uh

417
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,639
sent through the uh the galaxy

418
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,839
through space

419
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,199
and

420
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,360
and have disruptions of your encryption

421
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,480
because what happens there's uh

422
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,959
specifically the ion charges it could

423
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,399
when it hits those elect it hits the

424
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,279
electronics on a spacecraft it can only

425
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,959
could just take one particle and it

426
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,959
causes what they call it a single event

427
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,920
upset and it'll flip a bit

428
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,279
in the electronics and if you're doing

429
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,399
encryption

430
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,920
it'll mess up all that king and then

431
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,519
you're going to lose your connection and

432
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,639
you're going you're going to lose your

433
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,279
contact with the the payload

434
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,959
as well as you're going to lose your

435
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,959
control of the spacecraft and so you got

436
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,440
to go and wait for that that it for that

437
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,560
system to re-establish uh re-sync the

438
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,639
encryption so that you can log back into

439
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,079
your system again

440
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,920
uh so that's the reason a lot of the

441
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,839
spacecraft if they don't go through the

442
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,279
expense

443
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,480
if they don't go through the expense of

444
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,240
getting the radiation hardening they're

445
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,440
gonna they're not going to use

446
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
encryption

447
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,639
because they'll lose they'll lose

448
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,680
control of their satellite

449
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,839
now

450
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,040
and and so here's an example

451
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,920
here's an example of a satellite

452
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,600
that was not encrypted

453
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,959
and some

454
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,399
apparently some ham radio operators

455
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,639
some smart innovative folks uh

456
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,880
discovered that the satellite was not

457
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,399
encrypted was open

458
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,279
in brazil and they started using the an

459
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,040
open satellite for their communication

460
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,199
purposes for like cb radio

461
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,079
and uh and at one point they arrested 39

462
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,320
people across six states in brazil and

463
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,839
by the time they got through arresting

464
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,880
everybody

465
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,639
and trying to get them off of uh that

466
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,199
satellite that they were illegally using

467
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,040
other people were using that satellite

468
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,160
you know because once you get up in

469
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,600
space it's kind of hard to go up there

470
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,880
and start adding you know bolting and

471
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
encryption and security onto the

472
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,720
spacecraft after the fact kind of like

473
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,480
down here on earth it's hard to go and

474
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,279
secure it after the fact

475
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,839
another famous example

476
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,839
is uh

477
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,440
proving the point that a lot of the

478
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,639
satellite communications are not

479
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,399
encrypted is the turla malware command

480
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,519
control where

481
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:54,560
where

482
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,399
the malware would infect an end user

483
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,160
and and then send out communications

484
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,880
to ip addresses that were being spoofed

485
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,599
in satellite network footprints across

486
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,520
uh southern europe and north africa

487
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,000
and so the malware would get infected it

488
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
was it would phone home to some spoofed

489
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,959
ip address it was in in some

490
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,839
for some satellite user ip address it

491
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,400
was being spoofed and then once they got

492
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,799
they received the handshake

493
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,640
the notification then they would go and

494
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,520
use a landline connection to establish

495
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
the two-way

496
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,960
sim commands back to whoever was

497
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,520
infected and so again this would not be

498
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,799
happening

499
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,799
the spoofing would not work if they were

500
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,679
using encryption

501
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,640
now again this is a calling out a

502
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,559
scenario that right now is is

503
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,480
theoretical but it's something to keep

504
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,240
out there in mind another reason to go

505
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,880
and harden these systems design security

506
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,480
into these new space systems what

507
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,640
they're calling space 2.0 that's

508
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,720
happening in the world economy right now

509
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
to build it in built into cyber security

510
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
initially is because

511
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
at some point not only could there be

512
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,480
ground to satellite

513
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,120
attacks but but there could be vectors

514
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,840
evolve where it could go sad to sat

515
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,760
either over rf or possibly optics

516
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,120
it's going to be a lot harder to do that

517
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,000
with

518
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,400
with optics but certainly possible with

519
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,720
rf

520
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,280
now

521
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,600
here's a real world example of a

522
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
satellite that was taking taking control

523
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,400
of

524
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,280
uh like there was a u.s german satellite

525
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,120
called rosat

526
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,400
and someone

527
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,240
that got control of it

528
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,760
and they were able to to point it at the

529
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
sun and uh

530
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,600
and get the side to the point that the

531
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,679
satellite was disabled

532
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,559
and no longer of use

533
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,200
there

534
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,160
there's the landsat 7 satellite it was a

535
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,960
it was uh taking control of twice

536
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,799
back in 2007 and uh 2008 two different

537
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,039
times that satellite was accessed

538
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,440
and according to what's up out on the

539
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,200
internet when those satellites were when

540
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
i saw i was taking control of whoever

541
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,080
the actor was they got control

542
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,600
but they

543
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,840
they did not go and utilize the access

544
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,559
that they had my what i read between the

545
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,960
lines in it is it's probably kind of

546
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,919
like a

547
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,720
windows person getting a shell on a unix

548
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,760
box

549
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
they they got access

550
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,919
they got a shell but they know windows

551
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,640
and they don't know unix so what are you

552
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,480
going to do

553
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,960
so so who so the so the people who

554
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,799
manage and operate the satellite were

555
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,480
able to recover and get back control of

556
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,080
their satellite on two different

557
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,720
occasions because whoever got access

558
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,640
didn't know what they were doing

559
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,000
uh

560
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,120
you know it's kind of like me getting

561
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,640
into a vms box

562
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,600
i wouldn't know what i was doing

563
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,400
similarly there's a terra satellite and

564
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
it was also compromised in 2008

565
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,320
june 2008 and october 2008 very

566
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,559
similarly it was accessed twice and

567
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,679
whoever the users are they had they had

568
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,520
the privileged access

569
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,840
but again

570
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,600
the owners of the satellites were able

571
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,679
to kick them off the satellite they did

572
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,080
not go and do anything with their access

573
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,480
but they did have control they did they

574
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,000
they were able to get in kind of like i

575
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,960
said

576
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
they got the shell but they didn't know

577
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,919
what to do with it once they got there

578
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,159
that's my that's my perception of uh the

579
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,880
research i've done

580
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,679
these bad guys being bad guys

581
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,559
you know

582
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,919
typically they're gonna start escalating

583
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,919
privilege and spreading influence right

584
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:48,720
so

585
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,880
so the analogy in my mind i keep going

586
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,000
back to is

587
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,320
is the windows hacker with a shell on a

588
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,600
unix box

589
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,960
it's going to be a long it's going to be

590
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,740
a long project

591
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,960
[Laughter]

592
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,799
i'm gonna have to get the books out uh

593
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,559
and and then uh and when you get into

594
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,320
these satellites there's some other

595
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,640
research i've done that there is a large

596
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,880
number of operating systems there's a

597
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,960
large number of command languages and

598
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,320
there's a long list of protocols that

599
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,080
they use so

600
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,760
what would you end up with one things i

601
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,520
perceive is kind of a security by

602
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,280
obscurity

603
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,080
because

604
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,520
because you might you got to know you

605
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,200
might need to know the operating system

606
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,280
they know the command languages etc and

607
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,000
that probably is buying the the you the

608
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
owners of the system some time so that

609
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,159
they can get control back of the

610
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,039
satellite because a lot of these

611
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,840
satellites have what the feature called

612
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,960
watchdog

613
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,360
so that it can restore itself at a

614
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,720
certain point

615
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,640
if there's some activities if the

616
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
satellite doesn't respond something's

617
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
weird going on with it

618
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,159
maybe if there's just a general issue

619
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,679
kind of the watchdog monitoring i must

620
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,440
i'm thinking might have been in these

621
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
cases might have just rebooted the

622
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,240
satellite or something to kick the bad

623
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
guys off i'm totally speculating but

624
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,960
just

625
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,280
basically what i'm reading

626
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,200
then uh again in 2014 there was a

627
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,679
satellite a weather satellite they got

628
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,880
hacked and

629
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,440
we got back control of it but but they

630
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,240
got access to that

631
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
as well

632
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,679
now this is one that really uh

633
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,400
interested me there's a

634
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,880
the apparently the brits have uh the

635
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,840
brit military has uh some satellites

636
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,640
they have four of them called skynet

637
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,799
and apparently uh

638
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,400
someone got access to one of the

639
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,000
satellites and held it for ransom in

640
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,559
1999 i found that really interesting you

641
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,280
can't hope you can't open your email or

642
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,799
open a browser these days without

643
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,640
reading something about uh ransomware

644
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,280
attacks well this wasn't a malware

645
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,039
ransomware attack but somebody was able

646
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,720
to get into that

647
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,039
into the satellite and held it for

648
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,840
ransom apparently

649
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,600
now

650
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,760
also on the space station

651
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,400
there's been two documented events of on

652
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,840
space station where

653
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,640
a thumb drive and a laptop were

654
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,000
accidentally

655
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,320
introduced malware on onto the

656
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,880
international space station now it was

657
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,520
not introduced into the flight control

658
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,360
system of the space station where it

659
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,840
would threaten the lives of the

660
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,200
astronauts or the with the mission

661
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,880
system but apparently got into some

662
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,280
network on the system so there's two

663
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,080
cases that are documented

664
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,600
of malware being introduced to space

665
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,000
station

666
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,960
uh

667
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,400
we were talking we were having some

668
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,159
conversations earlier about insider

669
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,640
trust some of us and uh

670
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,440
and uh this ago this goes back to you

671
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,720
know this

672
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,320
everyone gets vetted

673
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,240
everyone uh you know supposed to be

674
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,320
supposed to be a good person that we

675
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,400
trust to have access into our data

676
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,039
centers under our enterprise networks

677
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,559
working our socks

678
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,200
work in our network operations centers

679
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,919
and you know how the the physical access

680
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,480
and badge access to our data centers and

681
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,640
stuff well the same thing with uh these

682
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,360
ground stations we've got to

683
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,039
we've got to uh

684
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,279
you know monitor everyone's roles and

685
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,880
responsibilities and our access to the

686
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,360
network and not just leave all the ports

687
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,600
open on these networks

688
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,919
and control access to what can be

689
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,520
plugged into our networks because in

690
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,360
this case someone

691
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,520
apparently found an open network

692
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,159
connection is able to stick a raspberry

693
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,200
pi on the network for a period and

694
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,520
and still data

695
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,679
so

696
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,840
now

697
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,679
it's not all just the wild wild west out

698
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,240
there there is an international

699
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,320
committees groups

700
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,240
that do meet from europe the us japan

701
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,559
from around countries around the world

702
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,120
that are meeting to come up with how the

703
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,200
protocols should work how encryption

704
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,600
should work what are the best practices

705
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,279
what are the best practices for space

706
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,200
architectures you know the european

707
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,279
space agency nasa all these different

708
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,799
organizations the commercial

709
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,799
organizations they all work together and

710
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,679
come up with these standards it's just

711
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,840
it's like security in the enterprise

712
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,120
there's a whole lot of standards out

713
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,720
there getting created by the itu and

714
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,240
ieee

715
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,320
ietf etcetera but you know we've got to

716
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,960
follow them and implement them

717
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,080
and so there's just some of the

718
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,000
documentation that's out there that's

719
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,080
international standards for security and

720
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,200
best practices i'll throw up there now

721
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,440
this is a pretty comprehensive list of

722
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,600
what i've been able to find

723
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,120
thus far

724
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,279
best practices for securing space

725
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,480
systems uh

726
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,080
there's nist

727
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,640
a lot of uh intern a lot of people in

728
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,320
the international community follow nist

729
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
for best practices and standards this

730
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,400
past year they've released 80

731
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,559
the nist 8401

732
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,919
and nist 8270 documents for

733
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,480
securing space systems

734
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,760
uh

735
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,880
there's uh the sisa the fcc the other

736
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,080
they've all

737
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,880
have

738
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,559
best practice standards

739
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,480
uh and uh here just recently uh

740
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,000
like in the last two weeks i've

741
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,320
discovered that germany has also

742
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,279
released uh best practices for uh

743
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,279
securing space systems there's a lot of

744
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,480
there's a lot of

745
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,919
best practices

746
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,360
uh and guidelines that have been

747
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,279
released for how to secure the

748
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,440
spacecraft and the ground systems the

749
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,799
key is going to be is reviewing those

750
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,159
best practices and getting them turned

751
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,360
into policy and and let that drive our

752
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,200
our systems engineering and design

753
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,919
of these systems

754
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,200
but the guidelines are out there

755
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,679
some of the thoughts that i have after

756
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,679
doing all this research is you know

757
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,880
the drum that everyone's beating these

758
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,039
days is the defsec option take all these

759
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,720
standards like we just had listed and

760
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,480
build that into our processes when we're

761
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,640
writing our doing our initial systems

762
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,159
engineering and creating our

763
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,480
requirements and monitoring our supply

764
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,320
chain because we get this we get the

765
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,640
spacecraft up in space and somebody's

766
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,559
embedded some bad firmware

767
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,720
we got we get some hot firmware and

768
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,320
somewhere in that supply chain it's

769
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,880
going to be hard to go and fix it

770
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,960
flash the eprom once it's up in space

771
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,080
you know

772
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,799
or fix an operating system now one thing

773
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,200
that's really of interest to me is is

774
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,720
some of us were talking last night and

775
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,080
earlier today

776
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,600
is

777
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,520
a lot of the satellites now the new

778
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,799
technology a lot of it we're talking

779
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,200
about is a software-defined satellite

780
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,440
where containers and virtual machines

781
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,520
are being used

782
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,360
on the technologies are being used on

783
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,799
the satellites and that's going to open

784
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,520
up a whole new domain of capabilities

785
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,399
and verse

786
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,200
and

787
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,840
features for not only uh

788
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,200
unique

789
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,840
payloads but also for security because

790
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,440
when we get containers and virtual

791
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,000
machines going why can we not go and add

792
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,399
a virtual machine or containers for

793
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,399
security monitoring because we're adding

794
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,080
we're getting all this new storage like

795
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,039
we showed earlier

796
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,120
and

797
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,039
so maybe we could go and start adding

798
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,039
intrusion prevention systems adding

799
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,039
machine learning and ai

800
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,760
uh to monitor the commands and the

801
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,520
behavior of the satellite and if we if

802
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,120
we sense that somebody's doing something

803
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,960
nefarious to our satellite there's some

804
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,120
suspicious happening we can restore to a

805
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
known good container or known good vm

806
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,279
and monitor you know monitor uh

807
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,799
our

808
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,080
all the commands that are being sent to

809
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,000
us and somebody sending thing commands

810
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
out of order commands that we are not

811
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,159
expecting maybe that could trigger a

812
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,840
reconfiguration of the system

813
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,080
this is where i'm going next with the

814
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,559
research

815
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
is looking at building out a cyber range

816
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,840
myself a space cyber range

817
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,039
here's some tools that are free if

818
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,399
you're interested in space and you want

819
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,720
to do a deeper dive in

820
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,919
and

821
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,799
learn and learn satellites

822
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,399
the orbit the ground systems

823
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,440
nasa

824
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,080
who in the u.s is our government agency

825
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,200
that

826
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,679
manages space systems for the u.s kind

827
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,600
of like the european space agency here

828
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,440
in europe

829
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,039
they've released

830
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,600
the nasa core flight system that is a

831
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,360
cubesat software

832
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,200
system uh that actually flies on

833
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,080
cubesats uh you could use cosmos from

834
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,159
ball aerospace to act like a ground

835
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,720
station and nasa has also released the

836
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,120
42 space simulator that will uh model

837
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,880
the the orbit

838
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,200
for uh your satellites so you can run it

839
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,440
all in vms on your laptop and then

840
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,360
there's another cubesat that nasa has

841
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,679
released called nos 3 in os 3

842
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,679
that you may find interested in there's

843
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,760
uh some other open source project open

844
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,600
source projects called artemis and

845
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,559
satnags i would encourage you to look at

846
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,360
and

847
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,760
one that's popped on my radar here

848
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,320
recently is icarus

849
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,039
and iris is a is a tool that's out on

850
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,960
github

851
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,360
icarus was designed to model

852
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,720
simulate

853
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,320
constellations like

854
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,880
starlink and oneweb so you can go in and

855
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,640
model and simulate

856
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,159
for different satellite constellations

857
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,679
like ddos type stuff

858
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,480
and that icarus framework

859
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,799
is open source so that's another good

860
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,640
tool to go look at if you want to dig

861
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,520
into

862
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,320
and learn more about space
