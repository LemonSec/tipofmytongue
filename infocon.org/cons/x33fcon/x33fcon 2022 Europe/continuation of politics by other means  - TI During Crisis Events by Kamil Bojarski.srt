00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,880
conference sorry last presentation of

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
the conference and i know those can be

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,440
tough to attend especially after such

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,160
such intensive days as we have at xifcon

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,199
so on behalf of organizer i guess thanks

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,960
a lot as again so to cut to the point

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,359
and not to have this drug over for an

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,199
hour and a half or something like this

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,719
let's get started

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,880
on who on what we'll be talking about

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,360
and who i am and why am i talking about

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,280
i'm a great supporter of the inigo

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,840
montoya style of introduction so just

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,440
greeting we are there

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,399
is something about myself then

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,920
establishing a link

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,719
the

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,879
presentation we've heard were mostly on

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,680
the red team site hence i'm quite happy

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,879
about that because i would like to

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,320
present the

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,640
blue side of things that may be useful i

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,760
hope uh also for the purposes of the

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,039
adversary

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,559
emulation

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,880
and in terms of managing expectations i

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,240
hope to

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,119
to

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,760
alleviate threat intel analyst

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,960
in terms of in terms of how they

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,119
approach and how they address the

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,880
threats when something something big

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,200
happens in the world because sometimes i

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,759
feel that they might get overburdened

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,680
with what are the expectations from

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,479
management and how how the

40
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,200
uh how the support to the rest of kind

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,680
rest of organization can look like so we

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,840
will discuss some

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,840
actual case studies i mean it's of

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,759
course impossible to prove the negative

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,159
like the attack did not happen despite

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,560
some political tension or geograph

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,640
geopolitical relations

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,159
hence we will discuss

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,640
attacks that can be clearly traced to

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,119
those high-profile events but also we

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,759
will take a look at how the

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,079
uh how sometimes the analysts can

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,759
clearly overreach

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,159
uh with their with their predictions and

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,759
assessment and we will take a look at

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,680
the strategic

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,840
document of policy in the chinese five

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,399
years plan and how the analysts who are

59
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,319
dealing with the with the chinese-based

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,959
threat actors uh approach it there will

61
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,280
be also a short comment on how the

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,360
russian invasion of ukraine

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,040
changed the trent lance came back but i

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,120
will comment on that later and finally

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,160
we will

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,720
deal with conclusions and how to how to

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,599
address properly those those situations

68
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,080
so first of all who am i i'm working as

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,160

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,599

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,000
gathering their intelligence

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,480

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,319
activities

81
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,080
i like to share in low-range hence

82
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
sometimes i'm a teaching assistant for

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
sun cyber threat intelligence course if

84
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,720
you take the live online version usually

85
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,120
in the u.s time zone i might be there

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,840
and you can read my thoughts and

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,720
my

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,200
side work in on the ocean national

89
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,920
security and threat intelligence music

90
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,159
at my blog counterintelligence

91
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,760
counterintelligence.pl in my free time i

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,720
like i like flying stuff i like aviation

93
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,440
i've got my own adsb station so if you

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,680
use flight rather and look at what's

95
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,159
going on in poland you might get

96
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,319
flights that are captured by my station

97
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,319
i like flipping flipping valley songs

98
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,560
and also climbing mostly bouldering but

99
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,560
that's that's also on b so i had to go

100
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
with climbing and of course feel free

101
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,879
feel free to connect if you will have

102
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,200
any questions after the presentation

103
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,360
just reach me on linkedin twitter or or

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,400
email

105
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,920
it's easy to find

106
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,720
so when i saw that my presentation is

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
last on the second day i was like like

108
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,959
you know the expectations are low

109
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,599
uh it's just so that recently i'm the

110
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,280
only thing stopping you from going home

111
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,680
so so it might be mahesh but actually i

112
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,760
think the rota made quite quite great

113
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,680
decision because the scenario i wanted

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,400
to present or to introduce the narrative

115
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,599
is exactly that it's afternoon at friday

116
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,079
like friday four five pm and it is it's

117
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,639
friday uh four or five pm so in normal

118
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,040
circumstances you you would be

119
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,440
uh you would be preparing to head home

120
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
and it's common cliche in the

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,199
development circles that you should not

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,520
push things into into production at

123
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
friday 4 p.m because something will blow

124
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,479
up and it's of course not not the case

125
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,040
usually with security teams i mean if

126
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
you have access to edr and you might

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
pass some push some blocking rule that

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,600
will that will crush the infrastructure

129
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,680
but but otherwise that's that's not

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
that's not usually the case in our

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,320
sector but what is the case is that

132
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,160
either the incidence happens at the

133
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,400
least convenient moment or

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,600
uh that the wars event the media picks

135
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,240
up something and blows it so that it

136
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,560
gains visibility for the

137
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
uh to the c-level personnel and they

138
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,639
have to they usually as we will talk

139
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,720
about move to the to the intelligence

140
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,000
team for support and the best example of

141
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,199
this type of let's say bit of spreading

142
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,400
fear uncertainty and doubt is this

143
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,960
cyber pearl harbor scenario the the huge

144
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,440
destructive attack that will

145
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,960
that will happen and that will cause

146
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,360
massive damage to infrastructure and

147
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,919
it's uh it's something that

148
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,320
sea level might be worth of and not

149
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,560
without a reason because it came up

150
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,520
again and again the top example here is

151
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,840
actually from poland it's me it says

152
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,400
polish general we expected a bit of

153
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,639
cyber something like cyber per hubble

154
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,840
and he is

155
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
he is talking about situation in ukraine

156
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,000
lower you've got leon paletta ex

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
director of cia who was also talking

158
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
about this and of course a bunch of

159
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
journalists who are on it

160
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,880
so when things like this happen

161
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,880
when there is

162
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,600
political tensions around the globe when

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,479
there is even that's picked up by media

164
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
what does the management or the the

165
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,280
security head of security organization

166
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,160
does it can reach to the to the

167
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
intelligence team

168
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,800
and can

169
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,560
ask them to to provide provide analysis

170
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,880
find out what's going on assess how it

171
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,319
will how it will

172
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,280
affect our organizations and what can

173
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,600
happen is that we end up in the danger

174
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,479
zone

175
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,440
why

176
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,600
because while the

177
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,240
while the it's normal that intelligence

178
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,520
team is in an advised advisory role the

179
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,560
what threat intelligence is is can be

180
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,880
quite quite moody let's say quite mixed

181
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,319
like you might be familiar with the

182
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,800
company jains they are most known for

183
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,280
their military reference chains fighting

184
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
ships but they also have threat

185
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,560
intelligence service but data

186
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,280
intelligence is around

187
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
insurgency activity military posture of

188
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,000
countries proliferation of weapons of

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,160
mass destruction and so on so if you are

190
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,400
a board intelligence analyst and just

191
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
applying to various linkedin jobs and

192
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
you would apply to threat intelligence

193
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,919
and jains and your cyber threat

194
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,919
intelligence analyst they might be quite

195
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
a surprise at the job interview so on

196
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,960
the other hand we've got like our own

197
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,800
let's say cyber threat intelligence as

198
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,360
here represented by the sanskros

199
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,599
4578 cyber threat intelligence that

200
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,960
teaches you how to analyze the

201
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,520
tradecraft of the adversary so is the

202
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,759
one threat intelligence more correct

203
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,080
than one than another of course not but

204
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,440
the issue comes when the when there is a

205
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,000
mix of expectation from the

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,400
from those who enacted and support the

207
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,440
threat intelligence server service so it

208
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
might be

209
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,840
so it might be quite expected that the

210
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,759
the expectation will be that not only

211
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,639
the intelligence team will be

212
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,639
will have expertise in technical

213
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,960
analysis of threats

214
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,680
and in

215
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,360
and in following the infrastructure

216
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
following the malware implants but also

217
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,759
when something something some let's say

218
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,759
adversarial actions happens they will

219
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,759
analyze the geopolitical landscape

220
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,000
provide the sound analysis of what will

221
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,639
happen whether we will be cyber attacked

222
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,879
and so on and so on so for example at my

223
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,800
company at intelligence we have folks

224
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
from both the cyber side and the

225
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,360
political side and we work together but

226
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,000
we are a specialized out outlet and als

227
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,840
and of course this might not happen if

228
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
you are in the organization you might be

229
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,760
the only threat intelligence analyst you

230
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
might be a threat intelligence that's

231
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,839
working with the with the incident

232
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,559
response team for example a support so

233
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,679
so how to approach it what to do

234
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,760
so first of all we need to establish

235
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,240
some assumptions and and like deal with

236
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,560
the reality regardless if you are a

237
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,279
small company or if you are

238
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,399
a big company like amazon or microsoft

239
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,560
your field of view will be limited and

240
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,040
especially in terms of the

241
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,440
of the analysis that

242
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,160
that extends beyond the beyond disciple

243
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,279
landscape

244
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,640
so

245
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
this combined with the fact that you

246
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
will kind of instinctively think that

247
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,000
the the

248
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
or central management can

249
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,760
think that the early world event affects

250
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,000
you can lead to biases on your side so

251
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,760
you will start to create the

252
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,680
intelligence requirements and

253
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,519
intelligence collections plan and so on

254
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,360
based around the fact that you're like

255
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,120
at the center of these

256
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,279
activities even if they do not happen so

257
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,040
you might be familiar with the with the

258
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
kevin bacon

259
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,200
which is the relationship between kevin

260
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,839
bacon and other actors counted by how

261
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,000
many there are links of separation

262
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
separation

263
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
in terms of movies so for example

264
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,279
michael emerson's

265
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,160
kevin become number is two because he

266
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
acted in movies with the with these

267
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,240
folks from movie loverboy and they acted

268
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,640
with with kevin bacon and in the same

269
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,440
example of course you can draw an

270
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,519
arbitrary relationship between your

271
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,240
organization and basically any event in

272
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,079
the world and this is something that we

273
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,240
should strive to avoid

274
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,440
because what can happen and what can

275
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
exacerbate this problem is that when

276
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,920
high profile event happens like conflict

277
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,320
starts like there is a tension between

278
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,920
the country where your company is

279
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,760
located in and so some other country

280
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,000
that is active in terms of cyber space

281
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,920
operation you can

282
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,560
you may want to move your collection so

283
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,240
so what you're focusing on as an

284
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,720
intelligence team to things focused on

285
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,760
the

286
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,959
on this event and uh in the first first

287
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,880
look it looks it looks perfectly

288
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,680
reasonable because you want to you want

289
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,200
to find something about this event you

290
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,560
want to analyze the activity you want to

291
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,399
compare it with your infrastructure and

292
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,480
so on but

293
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,720
ultimately this may lead to like having

294
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,040
a tuna vision on on what what is

295
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,279
happening so of course if you if you for

296
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,040
example take the

297
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,760
the

298
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,079
invasion of ukraine as an example and

299
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,800
you will start looking for for

300
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
malware related to that you will read

301
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
the reports from microsoft and from

302
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,800
other companies from ukrainian set on

303
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,720
what's going on you will find something

304
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,120
and by extending this threat

305
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,440
relationship further and further you

306
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,240
might

307
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,839
find a link that's not necessarily

308
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,640
direct or really feasible to your threat

309
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,120
landscape so first question to ask is do

310
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,760
you have any direct visibility so so

311
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,920
when you are talking about when we are

312
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,320
talking about the analysis of those

313
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,480
those far-reaching events do we not just

314
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
based on the visibility provided by

315
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,800
others and what are the biases related

316
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,600
from it and if we talk about the

317
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
highly volatile situation do we have

318
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,920
this direct relationship which we'll be

319
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,399
talking about in our examples

320
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
or do we just have the impression of the

321
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,600
relationship so let's go with the first

322
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,320
case study that shows a kind of perfect

323
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,120
storm of events that lead to retaliatory

324
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,240
attack

325
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,639
so there was a certain gentleman in the

326
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,880
united states i think he passed away so

327
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,360
so he was not available for comment but

328
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,600
he thought that the best way to deter

329
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,760
iran from the from pursuing their

330
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,720
nuclear program uh was to detonate a

331
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,279
nuclear warhead in the desert in iran

332
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,200
and threaten the further nuclear strike

333
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,200
if the if the program will not subsidize

334
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,639
so this

335
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,639
after this the

336
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,360
his and his casino enterprise suffered a

337
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,839
wiper attack it was some visual basic

338
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,760
wiper nothing nothing like super special

339
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,880
but

340
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,760
it did a job and cost of recovery was as

341
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,760
it was as we see 40 million dollars and

342
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,680
we have attribution from stereo from the

343
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,600
us intelligence so we we have

344
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,760
confirmation that i run link groups were

345
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,560
responsible and what what happened

346
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,200
behind the scenes so the quotes was for

347
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,079
from sheldon adelson who was the ceo of

348
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,600
las vegas sandscorp some the saudi

349
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,079
uh this push towards retaliation and

350
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,880
this adversarial relationship happened

351
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,120
just at the top level so so like

352
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,200
straight the the first officer the first

353
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,760
representative of the company made this

354
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,800
kind of

355
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,440
implication of threat and of course from

356
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,839
the from the perspective of the iranian

357
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,079
groups that was treated as an as an

358
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,279
invitation to to this kind of u.s policy

359
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,440
and why i'm saying this was this was

360
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,120
kind of a perfect storm because

361
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,680
in case of the iran structure of cyber

362
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,079
operation there are many subtleties and

363
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,800
complexities so for example iran

364
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,720
bases heavily on the independent

365
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,600
contractor groups that are essentially

366
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,839
essentially competing for the government

367
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,920
contracts if we can call it like that

368
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,199
the the groups that that

369
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,440
have effects that that can provide

370
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,519
effects are getting paid and are getting

371
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,079
further contracts

372
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:58,959
the

373
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,880
competition makes the operations more

374
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,399
aggressive and so on

375
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,120
and the iran has a history of using the

376
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,959
retaliatory attacks so for example in

377
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,480
2012

378
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,600
we had a so-called operation abba bill

379
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,880
which was ddos against multiple

380
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,399
u.s banks like

381
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,440
jp morgan chase bank of america and this

382
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,360
was the

383
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,760
this was caused by the

384
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,760
as this was a response as communicated

385
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,079
by the groups responsible uh to the

386
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,560
inflammatory inflammatory movie

387
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,519
published by the by the

388
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,839
radical fundamentalist

389
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,440
christian preacher from the united

390
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,839
states we also had deployment of shamoon

391
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,399
against the saudi aramco

392
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,040
which was highly destructive and was uh

393
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,240
was communicated as a retaliation to the

394
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,120
uh

395
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,600
to the acts of saudi arabia in the

396
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,320
region and if we look at the work of

397
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,839
those groups and then compare and

398
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,959
contrast it with the uh

399
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,880
let's say more pure espionage operation

400
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
like various those various kittens or

401
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,760
apt 33 34 45 that uh that are working we

402
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,480
will see that that clearly the iran goes

403
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,959
two ways in those terms and the

404
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,279
destructive attacks can be highly highly

405
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,000
likely given given these

406
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,560
retaliatory relationships so this is

407
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,880
actually actually what happened in the

408
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,040
in the saudi aramco case the saudi

409
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,680
aramco tried to try to deny the denied

410
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,399
the

411
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,759
that it had much effect but the

412
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,079
journalists linked this photo that

413
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,040
after the after the attack the

414
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,000
it the this flotilla of the tankers of

415
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,920
trucks could not could not get the oil

416
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,560
from the refinery due to the damage to

417
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,759
the systems

418
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,880
and another case study was the guardians

419
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,320
of peace

420
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,839
attack against sunny pictures

421
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,240
entertainment and what happened there

422
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,800
was the

423
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
this was a response to the to the movie

424
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,959
the interview if you haven't seen it

425
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,639
then then apologies but there will be

426
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,120
spoilers on how it ends then you can you

427
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,560
can leave or watch the presentation

428
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,399
later online

429
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,519
but

430
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,480
the movie was about two guys

431
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
tv reporters who were acting on behalf

432
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,639
of cia

433
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,279
and went to north korea to assassinate

434
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,480
kim jong koon

435
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
and it

436
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,800
caused quite a stir and it caused a

437
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,040
diplomatic tension and threats from the

438
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,600
north korea not only against only

439
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,880
directly but

440
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,639
also against the against the theaters

441
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,399
so that there will be terrorist acts

442
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,680
ahead

443
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,040
and

444
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,279
resulted in attack that was not only

445
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,600
just a hacker they released a lot of a

446
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,880
lot of stuff from sunny pictures

447
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,600
entertainment but also also disrupted

448
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,800
the it infrastructure used the

449
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,440
the employees who are who were

450
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,240
uh

451
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,079
who would turn down the pieces in the

452
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,560
morning so this uh this

453
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
red skeleton that they've been hacked by

454
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
the guardians of peace group and there

455
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,320
was threat to to

456
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,400
take down the interview before

457
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,720
before the

458
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,119
certain timeline or else and so on so

459
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,359
let's take a look on how how it relates

460
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,520
to on what could have happened in the in

461
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,199
the background so when we look at the

462
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,959
north korea state priorities this is

463
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,439
complied for the from the public u.s

464
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,679
intelligence reporting and

465
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,079
think tank reporting is that major

466
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,400
priorities are development of nuclear

467
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,559
capabilities ensuring the role of kim

468
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,200
family and being having this dominant

469
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,600
position in korea and peninsula and

470
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
especially especially

471
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,280
if you look at the at the second point

472
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,000
the ensuring the the rule of king family

473
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,400
like how this can be threatened and and

474
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,640
what could happen so what happened in

475
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,160
the movie and now that there is a

476
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,640
spoiler ahead is that at the end of the

477
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,039
movie kim jong-un

478
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,919
is traveling in a helicopter and it gets

479
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,000
shot down by by a tank nonetheless and

480
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,039
he he dies in a fireball so why this is

481
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,360
so significant because i mean this is

482
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,120
not the perfect picture because this is

483
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,559
actually the cia protecting the uh then

484
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,799
afghanistan president hamid karzai but i

485
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,720
could not find a picture of cia killing

486
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,360
a foreign leader but the point is that

487
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,240
the being involved in foreign policy

488
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,160
matters meddling in politics of other

489
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
states is exactly what cia does

490
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,600
so what from the perspective of north

491
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,320
korea what happened is that the movie

492
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,640
was the depiction of what could have

493
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,799
happened of what will happen like the

494
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,280
pers like the the declaration of threat

495
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,559
from the

496
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,799
from the united states now it is

497
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,320
debatable what

498
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,480
happened in terms of the tasking so

499
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,799
whether it were overzealous elements of

500
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,720
the of the north korean intelligence

501
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,559
cyber groups or was this order from the

502
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,760
top but this relationship of of like

503
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,640
kicking the hornet's nest in terms of uh

504
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,200
digging right into the into what makes

505
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
north korea the state it is so the rule

506
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,400
of the kim family was what the what

507
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,520
caused this mess this attack and against

508
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,760
the private company threats of violence

509
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,600
response from the president of the

510
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,400
united states who who said that sony

511
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,240
made a mistake because because they

512
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,840
should not have taken down the picture

513
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,039
because

514
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,720
it's essentially

515
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,520
for instance sensoring us artists and so

516
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,679
on and all this

517
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,960
mess so next let's move on to

518
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,720
wada so world anti-doping agency and the

519
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,679
uh and events that surrounded the 2018

520
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,679
winter olympic games so as we as we know

521
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:36,960
uh

522
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
now russia is quite

523
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,799
proficient in

524
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,000
providing illegal support to the atleast

525
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
they were running a doping program

526
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,440
that's run by the

527
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,000
fsb and sbr and the officers were

528
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,480
involved in faking the

529
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,120
the urine tests opening the containers

530
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,160
and so on so there were two distinct

531
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
operations that happened as a as let's

532
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,480
say relation to that in response to that

533
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,360
first was leaking of

534
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,600
uh documentation from from other world

535
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,320
anti-doping agency and it was openly

536
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,799
advertised by the by the group as the

537
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,880
fancy beer hacked him so fancy beer was

538
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,280
the moniker used by the crowdstrike to

539
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,000
describe the activities of russian gru

540
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,159
or well one of the teams and they said

541
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,480
yeah yeah this is us it was also

542
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
almost like in the face but what

543
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,960
happened then during olympics was that

544
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,440
there was another attack and here as we

545
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
were talking about the direct

546
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,000
relationship and direct victims here the

547
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,640
it's it's not so easy so the attack was

548
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,080
uh

549
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
it was against the olympic

550
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,799
infrastructure that was involved in

551
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,679
uh

552
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,640
in

553
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,200
vp access for journalists in the ticket

554
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,280
distribution so so if you wanted to buy

555
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,799
a ticket during olympics like last

556
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,760
minute you could not do it and the

557
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,240
collateral victim was not the well

558
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,000
collateral direct victim was the

559
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,760
olympian games but the collateral victim

560
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,960
was it provider as here we can see

561
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,200
in the indictment issue but the united

562
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
states department of justice the i.t

563
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,600
company one whose infrastructure has

564
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,360
been breached and because they were pro

565
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
iit providers to the olympian gays there

566
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,960
it was essentially a supply chain

567
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,559
attacks

568
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,679
and

569
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,520
they were used to to disrupt the

570
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,440
olympics to they had the infrastructure

571
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,039
and of course it does not matter if it

572
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,679
would be company it company one or it

573
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,520
company one two three four five six or

574
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,559
any other

575
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,840
the company that was here responsible

576
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,400
for the for the olympian case got like

577
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,960
got tackled because of the relationship

578
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,039
and if we compare those two

579
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,000
we can see quite a quite a shift in the

580
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,159
tactics procedures

581
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,679
because while the

582
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,240
defensible hacking team and their leaks

583
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
leaks

584
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
were openly

585
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,640
advertised like this is us in case of

586
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,280
the attack against uh direct attack

587
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,000
against the olympian games uh the

588
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,480
malware attribution was heavily thwarted

589
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,159
or there were attempts to toward the

590
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,360
attribution

591
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,480
uh the using false flags trying to make

592
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,200
malware look like the like the work of

593
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,919
the lazarus team and so on also the

594
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,679
russian government officially denied

595
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,919
responsibility here as we are reading

596
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,280
the indictment but

597
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,000
by the department of justice the those

598
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,240
actions were actually attributed to the

599
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,039
to the actors of russian state so as we

600
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,720
see when there was a hack and league

601
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,280
operation that was it was quite open but

602
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
once we moved to this this destructive

603
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,120
operation that could be considered in

604
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,360
various different terms for just a

605
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
cyber sabotage to perhaps an armed

606
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,000
attack depending on on the

607
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,760
on how you look at it

608
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,480
and the level of the of admittance let's

609
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,960
say dropped significantly but the effect

610
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,080
of those

611
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,600
did not

612
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,640
so those were the those were the

613
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,240
case studies that

614
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,919
showed how the

615
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,159
uh showed how

616
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,919
attacks can happen as a result of

617
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,960
geopolitical tension but what if

618
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,760
analysts are bit over sellers in terms

619
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,720
of analysis and sometimes sometimes the

620
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,559
there are many roadblocks

621
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,280
for the analysis so

622
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,280
china's policy is well not based but

623
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,360
there is major document of china policy

624
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,200
the five-year plan

625
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,919
which shapes the economic and national

626
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,039
priorities for the next five years

627
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,919
and especially interesting for analysts

628
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,159
and prominent since the 13th

629
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,480
13th plan five years plan

630
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,679
so which

631
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,919
was supposed to to cover the the period

632
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,600
between 2016 and 2020. and included for

633
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,159
example the made in china policy so the

634
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,400
so the move to the to manufacturing of

635
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,760
components in

636
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,600
china and getting the intellectual

637
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
property

638
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,320
on site

639
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,240
innovation strength strengthening the

640
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,799
industrial base and so on and if we take

641
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,559
a look at the reporting from the

642
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,480
reporting from the period

643
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,559
we can see that everything is five years

644
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,120
planned like we have at the top uh the

645
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,880
report from mandiant

646
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
lower is the report about the the

647
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,960
accident this is the report that's known

648
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,000
in this

649
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,520
cyber threat intelligence community

650
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,080
report operation smn so it was combined

651
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,440
effort of microsoft cisco fire eye then

652
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,080
multiple multiple companies did that

653
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,080
made the effort to to describe this

654
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,480
axiom protector

655
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,039
and here is the on the right side is the

656
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,960
document from the united states

657
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,440
government department of health and

658
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,760
human services which also describes uh

659
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,240
china threats and you can see here all

660
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,640
over the the references to the five

661
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,120
years plans in terms of the threat actor

662
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,720
relationships so i i took a look at what

663
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,640
actually in the fight it's in this fight

664
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,880
years plan actually that's a lie because

665
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,039
i knew what was there because i was

666
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,279
dealing with the with the china related

667
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,200
protectors but for the narrative site

668
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,679
let's say we take a look now and if we

669
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,039
if we

670
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,279
those are public documents no no need

671
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,440
for some advanced collection so if we

672
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
take a look we can see that the

673
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,840
technologies name in china are aerospace

674
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840
equipment so maybe something related to

675
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,159
jet fighters to flight transport

676
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,720
marine engineering so

677
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,440
naval shipbuilding

678
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,840
rail transit manufacturing to cnc

679
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,880
some computer numerical control machine

680
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,559
tooling used in

681
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,000
using production and precise

682
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,720
manufacturing robotics is so common now

683
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,760
in

684
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,080
in production lines

685
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,600
agriculture medical equipment

686
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,080
chemical machinery next generation

687
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,000
information and technically biotech

688
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,840
industry and that's nice for them but

689
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
that's not the end

690
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,200
the

691
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,120
special information

692
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,239
special information

693
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,120
processing and so on

694
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
advanced materials and

695
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
new energy vehicles so quite an

696
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,240
extensive list and if we look at the at

697
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,919
the other two attackers that were

698
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,919
supposedly active before this five year

699
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,640
plans like here described by the

700
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,520
uh

701
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,600
by crowdstrike the puter panda activity

702
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,720
they targeted aerospace industry apt-1

703
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,200
both of these groups related to

704
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,000
people's liberation army activity the

705
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,240
targeted i.t transportation anglic

706
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,520
agriculture or if we look at divinity in

707
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,240
its various groups that

708
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,840
targeted chemical companies high-tech

709
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,799
companies machine equipment companies

710
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,720
we may ask like what's going on did

711
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,559
those groups miss the memo that there

712
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,520
will be a next next 2016 plan that they

713
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,440
should refer to in terms of their

714
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,720
targeting

715
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,880
we can also like scroll back and if you

716
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,960
now take a look at the

717
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,360
uh at the department of human and health

718
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,000
services presentation you can see that

719
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,159
they also actually describe the activity

720
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,559
that took place between 2006 and 2014

721
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,240
and is also somehow related to this 2016

722
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,919
five years plan so what happened in the

723
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,159
in the end from my perspective is that

724
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,880
because this plan was so so extensive

725
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,720
and and covered so many different

726
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,799
industries

727
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,200
there was no no relation there was it

728
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,880
was it had no

729
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,200
significant diagnostic value what

730
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,679
happened is that because of those

731
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,480
those threat actors activities were

732
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,279
geared and pointed towards the

733
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,679
uh towards supporting china's national

734
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,159
priorities or any country's priorities

735
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,399
like defense strengthening industrial

736
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,720
base and so on the

737
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,640
use of firefighters plan in reporting

738
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,399
was not all about correct let's say

739
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,600
methodologically was not always about

740
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,960
the

741
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,120
uh it was not all about the

742
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,600
using additional factor for analysis but

743
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,320
rather a case of confirmation by us

744
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,480
where the analysts

745
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,640
saw the fighter's plans like pick and

746
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,960
choose if it fits to the activity and

747
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,120
then it was

748
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,279
it was used as a as a supporting

749
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,240
argument as something something like

750
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,399
supporting their thesis and if we look

751
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,720
actually at the 14th five year plan we

752
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,120
can see that those uh

753
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,200
those priorities that we

754
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,600
saw earlier especially strengthening

755
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,679
technological advantage uh developing

756
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,080
national security boosting domestic

757
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,480
housing demands also manufacturing and

758
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,559
having materials to create them are

759
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,960
still present so we cannot take out of

760
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,480
context like one single piece of

761
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,840
document and there are there are

762
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,120
multiple for the china

763
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,480
and and take it just try to apply it but

764
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,799
instead we have to fortunately or

765
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,880
unfortunately take a look at bigger

766
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,559
picture and make sure that when we are

767
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,960
taking in evidence they are not here to

768
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,640
support our costs but actually to make

769
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,520
sure make check on us if the if the

770
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,080
causes are in fact correct

771
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,720
so now comes the comes the the moment

772
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,640
that the presentation presentation was

773
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,399
supposed to look a bit different

774
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,960
because when when i was submitting the

775
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,200
call for papers in march the the

776
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,279
russian invasion of ukraine was was

777
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,840
still let's say quite in its early phase

778
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,360
so i

779
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,600
kind of tried to i kind of thought that

780
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,760
by the by the time the

781
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,480
uh the zip code will happen we will be

782
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,880
in a bit different place but but it's

783
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,799
still a stalemate so i would like not to

784
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,159
comment on the

785
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,799
only its consequences yet but we can see

786
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,960
on what happened already and what did

787
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,360
not happen so definitely what did not

788
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,600
happen and was to kind of let's say in

789
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,440
air quotes a bit of disappointment of

790
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,360
many cyber third analysts is that there

791
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,679
was no no expected massive cyber

792
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,600
armageddon let's say massive destructive

793
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,159
attacks and for various reasons so we

794
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,320
had these various activists these

795
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,000
activities groups like kilnet or

796
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,039
religion attacking ddosing targets in

797
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,240
the in europe and in ukraine

798
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,679
we had the

799
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,600
ddos attacks against the latvian

800
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,159
lithuania after the announcement of

801
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,399
sanctions against royal transport in

802
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,039
kaliningrad

803
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,080
and we had the activity in so so we're

804
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,440
doing very early phase like days

805
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,360
that followed the invasion and days

806
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,640
before

807
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,399
we had again attack against the

808
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,559
satellite communication provider which

809
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,120
cripples like internet access we had the

810
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
ddos attacks against banks and

811
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,960
government sides which you know when the

812
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
when the country is getting invaded it's

813
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,720
the it's natural that cities and look

814
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,600
for them to secure their belongings and

815
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,080
microsoft described the describe the

816
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,000
activity in the report and they

817
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,440
mentioned that wipers were being

818
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,159
deployed and so on but because of the of

819
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,799
the preparation of ukrainian computer

820
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,640
emergency teams

821
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,480
and other factors they were not as

822
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,760
successful

823
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,399
but what again what did not happen and

824
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,480
what many companies and this is this is

825
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,320
what's the inspiration for the for this

826
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,720
presentation is that many companies were

827
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,240
were kind of

828
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,320
they were upset to say list i mean

829
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,240
because they felt like this was a major

830
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,399
geopolitical event so this will this

831
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,799
will like fall back on us but of course

832
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,120
this the here we are going back to this

833
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,360
to this dilemma of of the kevin bank on

834
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,000
effect and and main character syndrome

835
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,640
so it's natural for the for such

836
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,039
situation to make you overestimate your

837
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,120
your threat landscape

838
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,320
but it is the job of the analysts to

839
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,559
to make sure that this overestimation

840
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,120
does not happen so here we can break

841
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,519
down the cases of of what was the

842
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,159
breaking down case studies into into

843
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,159
what were the motivations method and

844
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,679
relationship so basically if we look at

845
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,559
the at the methods of attack in case of

846
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,720
this this where we saw this relationship

847
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,320
there were either destructive or

848
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,279
hackanthic activities so

849
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,880
so the

850
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,600
response to the geopolitical event in

851
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,399
each case was proportional in a way that

852
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,440
is it was not a covert operation it was

853
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,760
not concealed it was supposed to have

854
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,279
this

855
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,240
this effect that will that will kind of

856
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,320
bounce back on the target

857
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,200
and

858
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,279
of course as we mentioned the

859
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,279
relationship is not always directly

860
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,720
directly adversarial so in case of

861
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,039
las vegas casinos

862
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,440
and in case of the sunny pictures we had

863
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,039
this dislike

864
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,519
seemingly direct threat but in

865
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,000
in fact sorry in case of las vegas

866
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,840
casinos and olympic games we had this

867
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,399
seemingly uh seemingly direct

868
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,519
relationship

869
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,440
but what happened was

870
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,000
in other cases is that the there were

871
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,960
some companies were just collaterals so

872
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,120
sony pictures of course have no

873
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,960
intention of starting a war in north

874
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,559
korea or or deploying cia operatives to

875
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,960
to kill the leader they just were doing

876
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,760
hard the i.t services provider attacked

877
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
during winter olympics

878
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,919
was not involved in the in the

879
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,159
assessment of

880
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,799
russian russian doping scandal and so on

881
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,279
but because they could establish this

882
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,840
second-year relationship

883
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,120
they were they were attacked so how to

884
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,240
how to deal with those and how to how to

885
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,519
remain sane

886
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,760
so i think that the worst thing that can

887
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,320
happen when these things

888
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
when these things happen is trying to

889
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,399
establish threat intelligence program

890
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,559
like right now so

891
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,559
if you if you are in situation of

892
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,440
heightened tensions and you will want to

893
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,159
have analyst new analyst new service and

894
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,240
so on it will be always by us toward

895
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,480
collection of this of the information

896
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,720
around these threats so having the

897
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,880
preparations and making sure that you've

898
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,039
got intelligence requirements you know

899
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,799
you know this relationship with the

900
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,600
vendors and supply chains and threats

901
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,440
can make sure that that you will not

902
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,600
actually be

903
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,079
can not will not be actually

904
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,480
alert fatigue a security operation folks

905
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,320
might say

906
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,280
and and will have clear-headed analysis

907
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,119
so in terms of the intelligence

908
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,960
requirements and expectations of

909
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,480
management

910
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,040
we have these we have to manage we have

911
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,520
to know if we have event capability to

912
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,079
assess the geopolitical situation of you

913
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,679
know if we are more on the

914
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,320
if we are more on the cyber threat side

915
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,159
so we can only provide information of

916
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,760
that we have to fight against like

917
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,679
putting additional priorities if we are

918
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,440
making sure that uh that what we do is

919
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,440
and that what we do is is

920
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,879
sound methodologically and

921
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,040
and provides adequate information and i

922
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,199
like models and i like methodologies

923
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,239
that

924
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,480
that because they provide a repeatable

925
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,000
sequence of steps for different

926
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,400
situations and one of those known in the

927
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,240
cyber threat intelligence is the diamond

928
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,320
model so it's i mean it's here it's

929
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
arrows model but it's you can imagine

930
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,880
the diamond that connects the vertexes

931
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,400
and it pops it has two main axises and

932
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
in maps the relationship between

933
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,040
adversary and victim so like social

934
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,960
political access and the infrastructure

935
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,160
and capability so technical access and

936
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,119
uh this diamond model made by sergio

937
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,960
caltagirona others highly recommend

938
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,280
reading about it it's got it axioms and

939
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,520
one there is always relationship between

940
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,680
the adversary and victim it causes the

941
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,400
the action to happen but my axiom is it

942
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,000
is that if you try hard enough you will

943
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,040
find a relationship between anything so

944
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,480
it's important to when assessing the

945
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,760
uh this social political axis to ask

946
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,560
what

947
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,119
exactly relationship you have in mind is

948
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,839
it direct or is it direct after after

949
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,280
many many steps is there

950
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,200
goals that will be achieved if you will

951
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,000
be targeted by the by the

952
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,320
adversary and for in case of destructive

953
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,400
i think there will be some

954
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,720
some goals to be to be achieved and of

955
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,359
course as we if we step back the

956
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,839
assessment of those goals does require

957
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,520
the expertise to have a political

958
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,000
situation from my perspective it's

959
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,160
better for it's often better for the

960
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,960
threat intelligence team to to kind of

961
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,240
push back on the on the expectation to

962
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,800
uh to provide those like recently in my

963
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,720
company in my team we had we had a short

964
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,280
discussion on uh what is easier is cyber

965
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,119
threat intelligence easier or is this

966
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,200
geopolitical

967
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,800
and one might think that you know in

968
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,640
terms of geopolitical you can collect

969
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,960
information you this open source you

970
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,200
have these think tanks reports this open

971
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,720
source intelligence reporting from

972
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,440
various government agencies and

973
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,280
in terms of technical intelligence you

974
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,040
need to have some malware reverse

975
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,119
engineering knowledge d5r knowledge and

976
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,119
so on so it's it might be considered

977
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,200
more difficult but i do not think that's

978
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,280
the case and that's because the adequate

979
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,000
collection of information that will not

980
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,680
be biased will not be

981
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,880
just public reporting but instead will

982
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,160
feed you

983
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,400
like on the ground view on what is going

984
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,960
on is at least equally challenging you

985
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,560
need to know the culture you need to

986
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,880
know the language in most cases you need

987
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,520
to know which sources are are biased and

988
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,920
so on so this all contributes into

989
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,320
sometimes like easy ways of relying on

990
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,880
on associated praise reuters

991
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,119
cables which might be great but will

992
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,400
always be biased towards how we

993
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,520
how we perceive the situation so what

994
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,760
how to how to counteract it

995
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,359
i would say that technical threat

996
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,200
intelligence team might want to focus on

997
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,440
the technical threat intelligence so we

998
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,359
do not necessarily have to have a

999
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,000
knowledge of what is going on in terms

1000
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,040
of the

1001
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,079
of the

1002
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,240
geopolitical events but we can be

1003
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,640
prepared towards certain deployment of

1004
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,680
certain tactics and procedures that will

1005
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,720
that we

1006
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,200
observe from our analysis on the threat

1007
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,359
landscape that are used to

1008
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,359
achieve those goals so as we've seen

1009
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,520
here the wipers and denial of service

1010
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,640
attacks are very common in case of those

1011
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,200
in case of those operations but we've

1012
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,640
only like scratched the surface of

1013
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,000
course if you have threat intelligence

1014
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,680
team you should pull more data

1015
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,320
and see exactly how these dos attacks

1016
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,800
were provided if the such thing would

1017
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,200
happen what how it would translate into

1018
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,760
your monitoring and response so we have

1019
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,839
a procedures for that and in this case

1020
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,280
you can kind of mitigate the need to

1021
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,680
mitigate the need to have very in-depth

1022
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,599
geopolitical reporting which might not

1023
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,240
be available to you and instead try to

1024
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,599
try to raise the

1025
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,480
bar for your organization

1026
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,440
in terms of the in terms of the

1027
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,960
specific attack

1028
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,000
so and finally finally assessing those

1029
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,760
ttps and so on would give you ideally

1030
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,640
ideally a line of defense on how to

1031
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,040
how to prevent those intrusions

1032
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,920
okay so i guess that's kind of what i

1033
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,400
wanted to conclude with essentially with

1034
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,520
this

1035
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,480
with these points on how to how to

1036
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,359
counteract the biases and so on so thank

1037
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,280
you for coming to xivcon thank you very

1038
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,839
much for your time
