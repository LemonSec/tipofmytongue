[Music]

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,360
all right hi everybody so i realized

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,360
that i'm standing between you and

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,679
unlimited beer but please don't think

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,599
about that for the next hour

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,960
my name is robert sell and i'll be

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,840
talking about insider threat and what

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,920
that means to your organization and the

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,359
inspiration of this talk for me was that

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,039
a lot of companies that i see are just

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,160
not doing that well i realize that yours

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,079
and mine are probably doing it fine but

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,120
there's a lot of companies out there

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,719
that are simply not

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,280
so the intent of this presentation is

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,600
really to kind of give you some insights

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
and some tools to and some some things

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,079
to think about as you go forward with

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,239
companies to help them improve with

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,960
their insider threat and and hopefully

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,199
make them more safe

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,320
so before i get started

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,640
just a little bit about myself so my

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
life is basically comprised of three

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,600
main buckets the first one is i'm the

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,159
founder and president of trace labs if

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,000
you haven't heard of trace labs we'll be

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
in vegas

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,159
defcon next we do

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,400
open source intelligence to help find

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,200
missing persons we do ctfs of that

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,119
nature so these are non-theoretical

33
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,799
we're looking for real missing persons

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,520
and we generate the all the data that we

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,280
collect from that goes to law

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,640
enforcement to help them find missing

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,000
persons so if you're interested in that

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
sort of thing check out the website

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,200
there we're always looking for more

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,960
contestants or volunteers to help with

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,479
our organization

42
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,400
also i'm in search and rescue why do i

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,920
mention that well it is kind of related

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
i do a lot of tracking so if you're lost

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,560
on the west coast of canada i may be the

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,079
one looking for you and that kind of

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,159
directly ties in with the ocean work

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,720
that i do as well i find the two are

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,360
very very similar and related and then

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,640
finally my work in information security

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,880
nit so i've been doing that like forever

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,040
we were telling stories last night and i

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
was talking about sun solaris and stuff

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,479
like that which made me realize how old

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,960
i am which is kind of sad so

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,759
so those are my three main buckets in

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,280
insider threat um is is a big area for

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,200
me in in kind of all of those in a

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,360
special way so it's a subject to me

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,920
that's that's um quite important

61
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,520
quick disclaimer

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,000
standard stuff so i have a lot of ideas

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,760
not all those are good all these

64
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,599
opinions are just my own not everyone

65
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,560
else's

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,800
some of this data changes quite quickly

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,840
as well so if there's a mistake or this

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,080
technique or tool doesn't work anymore

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,360
please tell me while we're drinking

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,000
beers and that will help me as well and

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,319
also if you have other insights

72
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,800
in to insider threat

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,239
that i haven't talked about as well i'd

74
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,879
love to hear that from you

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,440
so today's journey is going to be a few

76
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,599
different steps five different steps and

77
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,080
step one is really to understand

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,160
what we're talking about when we say

79
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,480
insider threat like what what is that

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,080
actually about because there's a bunch

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,959
of nuances there it's not as simple as

82
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,959
just espionage and things like that

83
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,879
although that is a big component

84
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,159
there's different levels and i think

85
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,840
it's very important to understand those

86
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,080
levels so that we can take appropriate

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,519
action

88
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,280
step two is to prevent how do we stop

89
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
these bad things from happening

90
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,200
and then if they do happen which they

91
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,440
are how do we detect that

92
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,120
and then how do we respond and

93
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,879
ultimately at the very end

94
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,640
what kind of strategy can you then

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,000
implement so at the end i want to give

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you something that you can then take and

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
then apply

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
so let's start off with understand

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,920
and to understand we usually start off

100
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,440
with a definition

101
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,200
and they're always terrible i always

102
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
like to pick apart definitions uh

103
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
because just they're just so bad

104
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,640
generally i don't know why our industry

105
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,239
makes bad definitions but maybe i'm just

106
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,640
overly critical but

107
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,799
um you know it's it's not always just

108
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,720
exploiting some sort of vulnerability

109
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,799
that a bad actor finds with the intent

110
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,439
to cause harm although that is something

111
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,799
that happens

112
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,480
i find it's usually the the insider has

113
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,959
some potential and it's either

114
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,599
authorized access they have access to

115
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,319
or an understanding of the organization

116
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,439
i think those two

117
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,560
pieces are are important but also it

118
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,000
could be either malicious or complacent

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,320
or also unintentional completely

120
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,839
unintentional and so i'll talk about a

121
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,600
big part of that i think that's

122
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,960
something to consider we often think

123
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,880
about insider threat

124
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,440
as uh the bad guy who's just waiting to

125
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,520
cause harm and that's not necessarily

126
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,360
the case

127
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
so

128
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
why is this important why do we care

129
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,639
well i just threw some numbers up here

130
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,560
and these numbers are growing all the

131
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,960
time and these are about a year old now

132
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,400
right so they're going to be bigger but

133
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,320
if we just look at a few of them

134
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,840
2500

135
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,680
internal security breaches in the us

136
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,479
daily uh that's pretty big that's going

137
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,199
up that's just the u.s 34 34 of

138
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,600
businesses around the globe are infected

139
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,360
yearly

140
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,040
then we have the last two years it's

141
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,199
increased about almost 50 percent that's

142
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,160
huge

143
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,560
and then the average cost has gone up 31

144
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
percent and you can look those are those

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,080
are in their millions so i liked about i

146
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,560
like to think about that in regards to

147
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,639
stocks if those were stocks and those

148
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,039
were the returns you'd buy them right

149
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,600
so i think it's a fairly significant and

150
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,240
important subject to to understand and

151
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,880
to make part of our strategy

152
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,960
and if that wasn't reason enough to

153
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,120
think about this with your organization

154
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,440
this is really interesting so if you

155
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,360
have time one day take a look at this if

156
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,039
you're not already familiar with it so

157
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,680
not only is insider threat in general

158
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,320
increasing costly

159
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,800
very very popular but also now we have

160
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,120
nation states that are changing the way

161
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,240
that things operate so as of 2017 you

162
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,400
can read article 14

163
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,440
you know where the the chinese

164
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
government has said well basically we

165
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,199
can take any person or any organization

166
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,520
and turn them into a spy while rob how's

167
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,560
that different from the rest of the

168
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,039
world well i think that there is

169
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,960
historically not been

170
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
so much activity like that and this

171
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
really changes the game in how we

172
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,800
operate and i think it's a very

173
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,039
dangerous change so take a look at that

174
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,720
i'm going to get into the nuances of

175
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,120
insider threat today because like i said

176
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,800
it's not all the same it's not all just

177
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
a bad guy the cloak and dagger there's

178
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,520
also

179
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,120
a lot of kind of

180
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,280
less intentful uh or less

181
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,520
skill-set people there as well right so

182
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,319
i'm gonna go through the different

183
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,400
categories the different types whether

184
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,840
they have intent whether they were

185
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,639
triggered right so were these people uh

186
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,479
kind of conditioned within your company

187
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,080
to then go and do bad things and the

188
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,560
answer is yes right as we can see here

189
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
and the levels of sophistication as well

190
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,600
so i think that's very important

191
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,800
so to start off we're going to talk

192
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,479
about pawns

193
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,720
these are the people that

194
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,880
often are innocent they didn't mean to

195
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,240
do it these are the people that click

196
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,960
the link that open the attachment over

197
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,479
and over again

198
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,240
i often think about these people as

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,520
having high charisma but low wisdom

200
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,759
and they're they're very

201
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,440
you know sorry that they did it when

202
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,800
they make the mistake and you make them

203
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,479
aware of it they're like oh i'm so sorry

204
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,080
i'll never do it again and then that's

205
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,360
yes they will

206
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,160
um they regret what they did they they

207
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,840
really sometimes it will have a huge

208
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,919
emotional impact on them

209
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,880
and

210
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,400
and they're they're the pawns is an

211
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
appropriate word right because they're

212
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,759
really being used by usually an outside

213
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,120
attacker

214
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,160
and

215
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,440
sometimes

216
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,840
the other side of that will be maybe

217
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,000
they're just a little bit lazy and they

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,479
don't really want to follow the policy

219
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,960
um either way their intent is not really

220
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,759
to damage the organization so much as

221
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,199
just you know

222
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,160
they clicked the link because they

223
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,280
thought it was the right thing or they

224
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,199
just don't care

225
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,919
so

226
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,680
um there's always usually a trigger

227
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,520
event with this as well right so this is

228
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,720
something that's happening within the

229
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,560
organization where they're doing

230
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,000
something and they're making themselves

231
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,440
an insider threat and this could be

232
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,280
mitigated fairly easy which i'm going to

233
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,800
get into later

234
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
as well but that's something to think

235
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,960
about right this is an internal trigger

236
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,520
so within the ponds category we have the

237
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
accidental so those are the people that

238
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,759
are very innocent they click the link

239
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,960
uh it's a phishing link or an email or

240
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
maybe someone phones them and is posing

241
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,120
as an administrator or something like

242
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,840
that so these are uh the innocent

243
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,759
there's no intent there at all

244
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,840
an example of that

245
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,240
is the twitter hack this was not too

246
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,759
long ago i think it's a couple of years

247
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,200
ago now maybe

248
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,599
there was several components to this but

249
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,839
one of the components was

250
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,479
the hackers posing as the administrators

251
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,799
of twitter to simply get to some creds

252
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,040
and move to the next level so

253
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,640
maybe not the best example but i thought

254
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,160
this was everybody will be familiar with

255
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,279
this one so that's an example of that

256
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,480
the next

257
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,760
sort of category of uh or the next type

258
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,720
of pawns is the lazy

259
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,880
and so very similar these are not

260
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,040
necessarily so innocent they just don't

261
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
really care they don't want to follow

262
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,480
the policy

263
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,279
um they're they're lazy that way

264
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,959
they they don't really feel too much

265
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,360
remorse so they may not say sorry so

266
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,560
many times

267
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,320
um they're not really interested in

268
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,160
greed which is interesting they just

269
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,080
don't they just want work avoidance

270
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,360
basically they just don't want to go

271
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,440
through all the hassle

272
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,920
they're not really interested in any

273
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,680
additional effort

274
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,560
so

275
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,720
an example of that might be just leaves

276
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,680
the laptop open at the airport they

277
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,600
don't care who sees it or maybe it's the

278
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
paper that they leave somewhere they're

279
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,760
not follows following the

280
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,880
disposal processes uh and policies right

281
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
like other people would so

282
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,600
and i see this all the time um people

283
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,839
just don't care and this especially

284
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,160
happens if you let it so if a company

285
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,880
doesn't do something about this behavior

286
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,800
it will just continue and get worse

287
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,240
right

288
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,120
um oops what did i do

289
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,519
oh here we go an example of this

290
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,440
i had to use this example right it just

291
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
i thought it was incredible so this is

292
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,600
an employee one of the super computers

293
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,160
in russia probably not fully utilized so

294
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,760
he's like well i'll just mine some

295
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,959
bitcoin

296
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,519
and so the fsb picked him up and he's

297
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,279
probably having a bad day right now

298
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,320
but um set example of that just doesn't

299
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,920
care he's like well i'll mine some

300
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,560
bitcoin i got some extra capacity here

301
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,959
the next category is turn cloaks so

302
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,600
while pawns are kind of victims and we

303
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,079
feel sorry for them

304
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,279
turn cloaks are are not right so

305
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,399
they have a purpose and an intent

306
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,200
and they'll show some remorse sometimes

307
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,279
but not usually right like they're out

308
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,800
to do something

309
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,040
and um they won't necessarily change

310
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,279
their habits if you give them additional

311
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,640
training and things like that they

312
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,399
really have a mission

313
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,279
so but there is usually a trigger that

314
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,079
happens within the organization that is

315
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,399
that is creating that that type of

316
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,240
activity right so there's opportunities

317
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,720
here as well to curb this and defend

318
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,040
against this

319
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,360
so one type of turn cloak is the career

320
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,880
turn cloak and

321
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,720
going through my

322
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,480
my uh career

323
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,880
in ite and security i used to see this

324
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,480
all the time people come up and i'm

325
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,399
gonna date myself again but they would

326
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,839
come up to me and they'd say oh rob do

327
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,160
you have some blank cds or blank dvds

328
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,279
and now it's you know hey do you have a

329
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,240
usb key i can have it's like why

330
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,839
and they're loading that up with data

331
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,800
because they're going to leave the

332
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,040
organization in a week or two and so we

333
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
see this all the time and i think this

334
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,480
if you're

335
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,920
looking for opportunities in your

336
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,600
organization to

337
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,079
to reduce ip leakage i mean this is a

338
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,000
great one we still are so terrible at

339
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,959
this right

340
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,600
um so no intent to cause harm they just

341
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,120
don't care they want all their data and

342
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,399
they're going to probably take all the

343
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,079
other project data that they can access

344
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,399
and stuff like that your dlp systems may

345
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,560
help a little bit with that but um

346
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,279
yeah this happens all the time

347
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,360
just motivated by that desire to keep

348
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,760
all of their creative content

349
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,360
so they may be ignorant of the rules and

350
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,800
if you confront them

351
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,680
quite often they plead ignorance

352
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,440
but they at the end of the day they just

353
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
generally don't care and they'll do it

354
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,240
if they can

355
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,360
so

356
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,680
typical scenarios is exfoliating their

357
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,240
data uh portable media used to be the

358
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,399
go-to thing but now of course with cloud

359
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,839
and stuff like that they can just put it

360
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,360
online so

361
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,800
that's something to watch out for and um

362
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,040
oops i go the wrong way all the time

363
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,160
with this

364
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,320
so my favorite example of this this is

365
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,920
just crazy

366
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,480
is um the google insider threat where

367
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,560
the guy's working at google and uh

368
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
they're developing self-driving program

369
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,160
here for self-driving cars and stuff

370
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,079
like that on the way out the door he's

371
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,079
like i'll just take all this data with

372
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:56,800
me

373
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,040
and um and then starts his own company

374
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,240
with that data so crazy goes to jail

375
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,399
um yeah just amazing but this is like

376
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,360
the

377
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
the classic example of that or the

378
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,160
extreme example of that rather

379
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,720
but this happens at a at a less extreme

380
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,600
level every day

381
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,959
so the next type of turn cloak is uh

382
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,120
disgruntled and i think this is another

383
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,440
one that i would focus on right because

384
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,560
we have

385
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,839
a great opportunity for change with this

386
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,160
type of insider threat this is the

387
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
person that's disgruntled this this

388
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,079
person's been pissed off right basically

389
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,399
you have not treated them well

390
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,480
or there's been something that's been

391
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,399
triggered that's caused them to be that

392
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,279
way

393
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,519
and they have an intent to cause harm

394
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,800
and they will

395
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,199
their likelihood of success is very high

396
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,839
even if that is simply to cause

397
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,079
disruptions in the workforce and things

398
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,360
like that

399
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,959
ransomware

400
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,199
discouraging other employees bringing

401
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,040
down morale

402
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,639
you just need a couple of these people

403
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,399
and it's not going to be good right so

404
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,720
at least productivity can go down but

405
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,920
they could also do things like

406
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,320
introducing ransomware and things like

407
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,399
that and that this this actually happens

408
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,399
quite a bit right so i think there's a

409
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,639
great opportunity with this one

410
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,519
an example of this is you know don't

411
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,959
don't piss off your sysadmin when they

412
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,040
know all the uh passwords to all your

413
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
routers right so this person changed

414
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
those and basically shut down this

415
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,199
company for a while that was uh a bad

416
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,480
day for everyone

417
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,079
more than eight hundred thousand dollars

418
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,839
in damages

419
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:32,880
not good

420
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,839
so this happens a lot as well

421
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,720
which brings me finally to

422
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,399
imposters so while ponds are accidental

423
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,279
and turn cloaks have intent as we saw

424
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,079
right the uh imposters are sophisticated

425
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,680
so these are the people that could be in

426
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,800
your company

427
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,959
uh pulling all your ip and you wouldn't

428
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,839
necessarily know about it uh ever

429
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,120
and then you see some other companies

430
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,560
start and now they've got a competitive

431
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,360
advantage and things like that so these

432
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,680
are super super harmful for a creative

433
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,320
company and one of the things i i think

434
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
about a lot when i was developing this

435
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,360
talk was how unfortunate that is

436
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,519
there's been a lot of discussion around

437
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,199
how a lot of companies especially in

438
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,720
silicon valley

439
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,880
and places like that have lost all their

440
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,760
ip

441
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,680
due to this phenomenon right and there's

442
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
no need for it really

443
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,160
so this is uh not emotional for these

444
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,839
people this is a business typically and

445
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,120
that's good to know because anything

446
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,880
that's run like a business

447
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,959
you can know kind of how they're going

448
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,720
to operate so if you make it painful and

449
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,920
expensive for them to get your ip they

450
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,600
may move on to another company that's

451
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
softer and easier right

452
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,120
so

453
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,360
unlike however the turn cloaks and the

454
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,040
pawns there's no real trigger here

455
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,560
you're not pissing them off or

456
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,880
irritating them or doing something or

457
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,079
not giving them enough training

458
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,720
necessarily they're there as a business

459
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,759
to take your ip

460
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,120
i went the wrong way again

461
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,360
okay

462
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,880
so the first

463
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,120
type of imposter is malicious right

464
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,639
these are the people that are really

465
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,720
want to do harm to your organization one

466
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,880
way or another so there's no remorse

467
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
they don't really care

468
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
um unlike the disgruntled malicious

469
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,800
wasn't triggered and

470
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
i kind of since i created this i've kind

471
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,160
of gone back and forth on this i think

472
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,360
there is

473
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,040
to some degree it could be a trigger

474
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,320
depending on the nature of your

475
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,759
organization and my example which i'll

476
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,839
show you in a minute i think was partly

477
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,440
triggered we could debate over beers

478
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,320
later

479
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,360
um they know the rules um and they know

480
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,120
how not to get caught basically right so

481
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,800
they're going to do something this an

482
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,040
example of this could be

483
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,920
whistleblowing or actual sabotage

484
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,839
we've seen that

485
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,920
so my example is snowden and i know

486
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,839
that's going to have mixed reactions

487
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,199
from from people

488
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,600
for me as well some days i think he's a

489
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,920
hero some days i think he's not but his

490
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,759
boss definitely doesn't think he is

491
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,279
right and so from his boss's opinion and

492
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,920
then the agency of course they view him

493
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
as malicious right

494
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,679
uh and to some degree that that's that's

495
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,439
true from their perspective of course

496
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,559
right

497
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,559
so that's an example of that the next

498
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,520
type of imposter is the pirates these

499
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,959
are really interesting

500
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,439
because they're fully intent on finding

501
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,599
opportunities uh to profit that's what

502
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,599
it's all about these are the han solos

503
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,119
right of

504
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,039
of the imposters

505
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,360
and no remorse obviously right this is a

506
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,919
business that's their their mo they know

507
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,360
the rules they've probably been in your

508
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,520
company a long time they know how it

509
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,880
works they're going to spend a lot of

510
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,320
time because there's a lot of money

511
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,760
probably involved they could spend a lot

512
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,280
of time going through and understanding

513
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,520
your defenses they may work there of

514
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,559
course

515
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,120
um motivated motivated by personal gain

516
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,600
monetary rewards of course right

517
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
and they're not interested in your

518
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,360
compliance training or your policies or

519
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,880
becoming friends

520
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,360
um or anything like that so typical

521
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,000
scenario could be ransomware it could be

522
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,799
credentials or just your corporate data

523
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,679
right your ip

524
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,720
this example i really like because for

525
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,760
for multiple reasons one is it's a great

526
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,679
story so if you're not familiar with

527
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,440
this story

528
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,760
this was a tesla employee

529
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,320
one moment

530
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,280
this was a tesla employee who was out

531
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,520
for beers like we're going to do later

532
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,280
and um his friend came up to him and

533
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,880
said hey i'll give you half a million

534
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,440
dollars if you plant this malware in

535
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,720
tesla

536
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,480
and uh i think he kind of went along

537
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,600
with it for a little while maybe he was

538
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,039
thinking about it i don't know half a

539
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,240
million dollars right that's a lot of

540
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,440
money

541
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,000
and he actually reported it

542
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,720
so

543
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,480
he gave up half a million dollars yeah

544
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,000
of course there was some risk involved

545
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,520
there of course he would be would become

546
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
a criminal and he could go to jail but

547
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,960
half a million dollars is a pretty big

548
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,080
incentive

549
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,600
and he went and reported it and these

550
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
people got caught so that tells you

551
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,960
something about the

552
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,440
the corporate culture there right and

553
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,840
his uh how he valued his job and what he

554
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,240
was doing there uh because he wasn't uh

555
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,919
swayed by that half a million so i think

556
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,679
that i'm not too familiar with with

557
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,520
tesla if anybody works there and has

558
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,799
insights into that i'd love to hear

559
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,400
about that but i think that there's

560
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,160
something to learn from that and i'm

561
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,799
going to talk about that later

562
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,080
because uh that could have gone either

563
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,679
way right

564
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,799
the next imposter is of course espionage

565
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,679
and this is the one that's i think that

566
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,600
we all think about when we think about

567
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,360
insider threat

568
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,679
and uh and this is the the movies are

569
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,039
about this of course and things like

570
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,640
this and you know these are the people

571
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,799
that are fully intent on their mission

572
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,520
also very kind of business-like and no

573
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,600
remorse of course they're they're

574
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,960
employed to infiltrate your company um

575
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,080
and move that data usually it's ip to a

576
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,520
foreign country right

577
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,760
and uh data exfiltration

578
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,520
without ever you knowing that it was

579
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,960
lost as well right i think that's the

580
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,080
trick here um it's a more graceful and

581
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,480
sophisticated operation typically

582
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,120
and if you're a large company with ip

583
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,640
then this would be a primary concern

584
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,799
example of that i mean this is a classic

585
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,799
examples and there there's there's tons

586
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,880
of these out there where you have a

587
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,120
usually it's an employee and they're

588
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,200
just siphoning data and one way or

589
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,440
another multiple ways to do this and

590
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,080
they're sending it back to uh to

591
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,440
the home country

592
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,039
uh and we see this quite a bit i mean

593
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,120
this is uh aerospace we see that a lot

594
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,280
in that sector of course

595
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,880
and uh but it can happen anywhere where

596
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,520
you have important valuable data

597
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,039
and there are some statistics on this

598
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,080
and i have to

599
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,919
put that in the next version of this i

600
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,440
think but it's it's a very high number

601
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,480
of how often this happens

602
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,640
so we've gone through that and seen now

603
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,720
the different types right the different

604
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,280
categories and types and the intent and

605
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,799
the trigger so you can start to see some

606
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,480
patterns here right you can see that the

607
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,600
pawns

608
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,360
are kind of triggered there's there's

609
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,559
things that are happening in your

610
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,880
organization that's causing them to

611
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,360
click on the links or to

612
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,200
open the attachments or to give their

613
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,400
credentials

614
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,159
and the turn cloaks the career ones

615
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,159
right there they're able to copy that

616
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,840
data and move that data

617
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,760
and the disgruntled they're able to

618
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,080
cause issues and we're not discovering

619
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,679
that they're disgruntled and that that's

620
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,120
why they're doing these things right

621
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,840
there

622
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,000
there's there's reasons behind that and

623
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,240
the imposters of course they're they're

624
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,919
fully intent on causing damage but

625
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,440
there's no internal

626
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,880
things going on there there's nothing we

627
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,799
could perhaps do from a culture

628
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,480
corporate culture perspective that would

629
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,520
necessarily change that right so i think

630
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,600
this gives us a good overview of what

631
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,559
that insider threat landscape looks like

632
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,400
so now we can start to think about our

633
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
strategy to move forward

634
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,799
so how do we prevent these things from

635
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,720
happening and we can look at each one of

636
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,600
these three categories in sequence right

637
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,520
so for pawns

638
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,360
you know there's a huge emphasis on

639
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,520
training user awareness training when we

640
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,919
think about things like our receptionist

641
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,840
right how much training does that person

642
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,280
get probably none maybe a little bit but

643
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,880
but not a lot

644
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,159
uh so there's all sorts of training

645
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,520
programs that you can do and i know what

646
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,799
you're probably thinking well yeah we

647
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,720
have training programs we we do

648
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,799
mandatory training and stuff like that

649
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,480
but most of the time it's just click

650
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,840
through it's like oh yeah i could do

651
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,960
that in five minutes bang bang bang bang

652
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
bang and it's done and employees don't

653
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,480
get much out of it

654
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,720
i would encourage people to gamify this

655
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,120
to make it interesting to make it fun to

656
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,480
make it something that people actually

657
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,159
learn from because most of the time they

658
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,600
don't

659
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,440
other things you can do is security

660
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,960
champion programs right where you're

661
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,360
actually rewarding employees for doing

662
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,159
great jobs so if they detect malware or

663
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,240
they detect a phishing attempt

664
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,640
instead of just keeping stats actually

665
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,400
make them turn them into a champion make

666
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
a big deal about it so other people want

667
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,720
to do that and get that recognition

668
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
so there's a huge emphasis on that these

669
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,360
are fairly easy things to do the see

670
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,039
something say something program so if

671
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,400
people are seeing

672
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,240
weird behavior are they reporting that

673
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,320
to their manager or maybe anonymously

674
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,240
right things like that and we start to

675
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
see a little bit of management activity

676
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,080
and technical controls for the pawns but

677
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,600
not a lot like a lot of this is just

678
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,280
kind of like soft skill stuff right

679
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
there's not a lot of technical controls

680
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,880
improvements there

681
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,799
start to move to turn cloaks right we

682
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,720
start to see a little bit more of an

683
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,760
even response we still are adding more

684
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,919
training more corporate culture type of

685
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,200
activity

686
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,520
right so employee engagement programs

687
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,200
how engaged are your employees so when

688
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,640
they become disgruntled because they

689
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,720
didn't get that promotion and things

690
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,480
like that are we actually looking at

691
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,919
that and paying attention to it right

692
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,159
are we seeing the change in behavior i

693
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,360
think that's really important and that

694
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,480
can really

695
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,000
help with

696
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,480
getting rid of some of that risk

697
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,520
so open dialogue on security

698
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
i find that there's a lot of discussion

699
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,799
in security we say oh security is

700
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,240
everybody's job well no it's not like if

701
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,520
you ask someone in marketing the

702
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
security your job they'll say no right

703
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,840
so they're not getting paid

704
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,200
the same they're not it's not their

705
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,240
priority

706
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,320
but we can help with that in various

707
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,520
techniques right by making it

708
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,039
interesting for them by trying to make

709
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,320
it their priority

710
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,240
by uh doing all these different things

711
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,400
gamifying it giving out prizes making

712
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,799
champions out of people in the company

713
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,919
then we're starting to get into more

714
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,080
technical controls so we're looking at

715
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,919
more dlp

716
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,919
denying portable media that may not be

717
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,840
possible for you but we're looking at

718
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,480
how is that data leaving the company and

719
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,200
trying to regulate that no byod

720
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,480
some places that's possible

721
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,080
and now finally we're getting into

722
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,000
imposters right and now there's much

723
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,559
more emphasis on technical controls

724
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,039
still some some stuff at the top there

725
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,960
some of those softer stuff right

726
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,159
corporate culture really looking at that

727
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:48,000
protectionism culture and i keep

728
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,279
mentioning that i really think that's

729
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,039
one of the secrets here

730
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,880
is taking a look at the the overall

731
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,120
culture so are people really proud to

732
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,200
work there are people going to stop

733
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,720
others from just drafting through the

734
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,120
front door things like that

735
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,480
that we really want to look at and i

736
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,640
would go as far as looking at really

737
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,320
creative ways to solve this problem

738
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,159
right so when we look at

739
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,039
visible activity as far as the sock or

740
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,039
even cctv

741
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,559
what would happen if you were to show

742
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,279
the cctv activity to everyone right so

743
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,360
if everybody could see that in real time

744
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,440
and report any weird stuff going on i'm

745
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,200
not advocating that you necessarily have

746
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,600
to do that but creative ways to solve

747
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
this problem and then adding more

748
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
technical controls so tamper-proof card

749
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,559
access how many people have tamper proof

750
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,279
engaged on their car access i bet not

751
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,840
too many right so fairly easy to mess

752
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,080
with that sort of stuff i'm a huge fan

753
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,840
of micro segmentation especially with

754
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,679
software defined networks

755
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,520
i find that when we're looking at access

756
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,760
to different areas that's a great tool

757
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,679
and then finally we can move into

758
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,039
detection

759
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,200
so how do we actually start to detect

760
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,240
these threats if they're in and they are

761
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,760
right so

762
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
the two kind of ways that we look at

763
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,919
this is from a tools perspective of

764
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,520
course right so

765
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,840
typical information security tools we

766
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,960
can look at that and then we can also

767
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,200
look at behavior so we can identify

768
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,679
insider threat iocs

769
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,480
and

770
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,320
you know in an ideal world there would

771
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,480
be this holistic mix of both of their

772
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,559
those we would bring them together

773
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,760
however

774
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,440
a lot of companies they don't have

775
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,600
sufficient staff even for information

776
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,520
security alone

777
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,440
let alone insider threat detection right

778
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,120
they definitely don't have an

779
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,440
anti-espionage team right that's usually

780
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,080
working it's very rare that i i see that

781
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,320
so how do we solve that problem and i

782
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,640
would go back again to corporate culture

783
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,320
right so when we look at

784
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,559
scale we need to be able to scale our

785
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,080
security teams and how do we do that we

786
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,840
need to utilize people in the company

787
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,279
but it's not their job so how do we make

788
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,320
it their job so i i would encourage some

789
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,480
sort of reporting system where you can

790
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,080
get a heads up of

791
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,400
any sort of strange activity but then

792
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,679
you need to encourage that you need to

793
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,600
reward that and it needs to be a system

794
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,120
that works right so it's either up

795
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
through management or it's some sort of

796
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,080
anonymous reporting

797
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,159
some indicators of compromise which i

798
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,480
recommend at a management level

799
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
uh you know i think that management

800
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,720
should be familiar with these things and

801
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,640
thinking about these things often we're

802
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,440
not right so when someone's passed over

803
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
for a promotion at a management level

804
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
how often do we think about oh i wonder

805
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,399
if this is going to turn into an insider

806
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,720
threat i would guess like never

807
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,960
right and but quite often it does quite

808
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,960
often at least it moves into a person

809
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,600
who's no longer engaged and that's going

810
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,760
to become closer and closer to that

811
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,080
insider threat situation right so these

812
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,480
are all things to look for conflict i

813
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,679
think we have a lot of work to do in

814
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,279
organizations to actually mitigate

815
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,520
conflict and make that turn that into a

816
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,360
more productive environment but these

817
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,039
are some of the things that we can look

818
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,720
at of course the bottom of four groups

819
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,159
those are pretty obvious right so if

820
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,919
there's criminal activity if they're

821
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,440
messing with backdoors if they're doing

822
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,240
any of those things like that's that's a

823
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,039
you know a huge red flag that

824
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,480
that you should worry about

825
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
since some indicators have compromised

826
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,320
just for employees in general

827
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,840
this is what i would take a look at and

828
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,039
this gets complicated right because you

829
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,159
don't want to create a witch hunt you

830
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,399
don't want people going oh yeah i saw

831
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,840
joe over there doing something bad i'm

832
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,360
going to report him

833
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,960
so you have to be very careful with how

834
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,440
you use this and this is not exhaustive

835
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,799
of course there's there's many more but

836
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,480
these are some of the key things

837
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,960
that you want to watch for

838
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,120
and your company is going to

839
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,399
depending on the culture

840
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,919
it's going to depend on how you want to

841
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,399
have that reported

842
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,520
so then finally how do you respond now

843
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,600
that you you once you have something

844
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,159
going on in your organization uh what

845
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,720
are you going to do there so hopefully

846
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,640
you have something already written down

847
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,240
you have the uh

848
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,399
insider thread as a component of your

849
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,200
incident response plan if it's not you

850
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,799
probably want it to be because the last

851
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,520
thing you want to do is respond to to

852
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,960
that kind of on the fly and improvise

853
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,640
i remember my first

854
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,640
interaction with law enforcement in a

855
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,080
corporate environment

856
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,799
was uh we had to report something and we

857
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,159
had a a

858
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,399
a police officer coming from the street

859
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,480
with the street clothes on like the the

860
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
40-pound vest and everything like that

861
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,880
and had no idea what i was talking about

862
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,840
it became immediately apparent and uh

863
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,000
yeah he was super confused and it was

864
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,279
just strange so you don't want that

865
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,120
scenario you can learn from me

866
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,279
um understand what you're dealing with

867
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,520
right so this could become a legal issue

868
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,039
fairly quickly especially if you make a

869
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,159
mistake

870
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,320
so do you fully understand

871
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,840
oh i'm sorry you should have told me i

872
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,440
was i was just reading the wrong slide

873
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,919
here i'm sorry um so yeah so so you want

874
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,760
to fully understand what you're dealing

875
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,880
with here right because this could turn

876
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
into a legal event and if you jump the

877
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,840
gun

878
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,679
and uh and act on something prematurely

879
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,440
it could be bad for you and the company

880
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,960
right so you have to really understand

881
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,159
what happened

882
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,640
and why

883
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,799
responding based on evidence so this is

884
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,200
related to that so you should have some

885
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,360
good evidence on on what's happened

886
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,600
because this could very well go to court

887
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,440
uh many of these things do especially if

888
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,919
they're more more serious right

889
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,520
so make sure that you've got adequate

890
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
evidence or at least access to that

891
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,960
evidence and it's not going to be going

892
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,159
to be purged

893
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,440
sometimes we have to be much more

894
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,600
patient with these sort of things than

895
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,440
we would like to be

896
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,200
um but this is one of the times where

897
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
you you really need to be need to be

898
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,799
patient and monitor

899
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,039
uh also this is really multi-department

900
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,399
right when we start to get into these

901
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,880
sort of things it's not just

902
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,799
information security as much as we like

903
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,080
to ice we like to operate in isolation

904
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,320
quite often uh this is something that

905
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,559
really you really need hr and legal to

906
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,880
be working with you as a team so if

907
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,520
you're not already working with legal or

908
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,760
hr if you don't know the people in legal

909
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,360
if you have a legal team

910
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,279
uh now is a good time to reach out to

911
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,200
them and say hey what's what do we do

912
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,679
for insider threat stuff like do i talk

913
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,480
to you and what's that look like and get

914
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,799
in front of that i think that that's

915
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,399
having that knowledge what the process

916
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,840
is going to look like before it happens

917
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,559
is a great idea and then as well local

918
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,039
law enforcement so don't do what i did

919
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,799
and have that beat cop off the street

920
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,159
come in and try to help you because it's

921
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,360
not going to go well and it's going to

922
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,960
waste a lot of time

923
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,320
what you want to try to do especially if

924
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,919
you're a medium to large size

925
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,799
organization is have a monthly call

926
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,799
maybe if you're not getting threat intel

927
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,200
from them already some countries like

928
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
canada we get threat intel

929
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,279
from our agency if you're not getting

930
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,519
that if you don't have that monthly

931
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,760
meeting with them good time to set it up

932
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,080
even if you're not huge as far as a

933
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,840
company depending on the sector that

934
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,200
you're in

935
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
you may get special attention right so

936
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,880
it's quite often worthwhile to at least

937
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,360
reach out get signed up for that make a

938
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,960
contact there

939
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,880
even if it's if you're in a small town

940
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,279
small company then just talk to local

941
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,799
law enforcement and start getting that

942
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,559
network built up right

943
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,799
so that when this does happen you're

944
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,399
ready to go

945
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,360
um

946
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,559
yeah and then

947
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,039
response should be continual right so

948
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,760
there's serious uh uh

949
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,120
things that happen here with when

950
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,399
they're stealing your ip

951
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,840
but then there's also the other side of

952
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,679
it where it with the pawns we don't

953
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,360
really view that as

954
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,760
that serious right if someone's burning

955
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,120
all the ip before they leave your

956
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,039
company is that okay

957
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,360
i don't think it is right um it makes

958
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,440
your competitors better off because now

959
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,120
they have a lot of your data so it

960
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,279
really shouldn't be allowed yet quite

961
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,279
often we allow it just because oh well

962
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,760
you know sam's a good guy and you know

963
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,360
he's going to go get a new job and and

964
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,760
so quite often that's permitted

965
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,200
which i don't think it should be right

966
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,799
but if you let it then it's just going

967
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,360
to progress

968
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,559
so finally what's our our strategy so

969
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,799
this is something you can hopefully i

970
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,240
can leave with you that's going to help

971
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,080
you to develop that insider threat

972
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,880
strategy and uh and something you can

973
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,559
kind of directly take to your company

974
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,080
and hopefully apply in some form

975
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,880
so the first one is how do we respond

976
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,200
and that continual response right lack

977
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,360
of response is just going to encourage

978
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,720
that if people know oh there's no

979
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,679
penalty so i can take all this data or i

980
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,120
can do all these things and no one's

981
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,039
going to get upset with me or i'm not

982
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,720
going to get fired then it's going to

983
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,399
just get worse

984
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,480
start easy so i went through

985
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,640
all the different layers of insider

986
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,399
threat all the different types

987
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,720
all the different ways that you can uh

988
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,159
the different training that you can do

989
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,679
and things like that training is fairly

990
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,120
easy right you can develop your own you

991
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,039
can go out and buy some

992
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,960
but it's fairly straightforward to then

993
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,360
go and apply it's fairly low risk you

994
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
start getting into fishing programs and

995
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,480
stuff like that it gets a little bit

996
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,200
more

997
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,880
more uh

998
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,279
difficult but still i mean

999
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,039
bang for your buck that's going to be

1000
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,799
one of the easier things to to implement

1001
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,200
right so start easy why not right

1002
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
that's going to get take care of a lot

1003
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,240
of your pawns and even some of your turn

1004
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,399
cloaks right but then the custom

1005
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,159
approach for the different types i would

1006
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,480
recommend of course education for the

1007
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,440
ponds

1008
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,279
can be effective make it fun don't make

1009
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,639
it boring if it's just click through

1010
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,440
stuff it is not going to be effective

1011
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,599
and then the company culture for turn

1012
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,879
cloaks

1013
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,320
taking a look at

1014
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,839
engagement levels so do you do an

1015
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,599
engagement survey in your company do you

1016
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,918
know what that engagement level is like

1017
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,320
when people don't get a promotion when

1018
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,760
they get some sort of disappointment

1019
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,199
they don't get a raise and things like

1020
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,040
that what does your company do i know

1021
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,639
this is not information security that

1022
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,560
i'm talking about right now so much but

1023
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,199
it leads leads to that it makes it our

1024
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,599
job later on right if the if hr is not

1025
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,159
doing theirs it comes to us eventually

1026
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,119
because then they throw in some

1027
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,879
ransomware and now it's our problem one

1028
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,399
of the things i i really don't like is

1029
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,839
when something becomes my problem right

1030
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,199
and that often

1031
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,599
it's hard to see sometimes but this is

1032
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,000
what happens and so looking at the

1033
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,800
company culture and understanding uh

1034
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,918
what's happening there within the

1035
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,640
organization i think is super high value

1036
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,000
for people like us that are in

1037
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,079
information security and that can

1038
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,640
actually add our input into this right

1039
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,320
and explain to the company that and

1040
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,160
especially the leadership that hey if

1041
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,560
you do this over here it's going to mean

1042
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,640
that over there and that's going to cost

1043
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,880
you a lot of money so if you spend a

1044
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,320
dollar over here it's going to save you

1045
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,480
a hundred over there and

1046
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,640
showing them that linkage i think is

1047
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,880
going to help the company a lot and

1048
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,079
yeah so that's what i would recommend

1049
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,320
there and then for imposters

1050
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,720
uh really that holistic

1051
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,280
mix of technical and behavioral controls

1052
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,119
put into place right so when you're

1053
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,880
really bringing those together

1054
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,520
somehow monitoring behavioral

1055
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,599
changes within the employee base so are

1056
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,000
they trying to access the data closet

1057
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,040
repetitively are they working very late

1058
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,640
so if you're able to

1059
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,880
build profiles based on that behavioral

1060
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,720
activity and then combine that with

1061
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,240
technical controls so you can see that

1062
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,560
they're trying to log into those servers

1063
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,720
that they they have no need to log into

1064
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,640
or why did they just put three terabytes

1065
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,160
over there and it's just sitting there

1066
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,640
for a month right which is quite often a

1067
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,160
strategy that they will do because it's

1068
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,320
fairly benign and fairly innocent

1069
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,000
however it allows them to kind of test

1070
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,720
the waters can they move the data right

1071
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,480
and then collaborating early and another

1072
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,720
huge thing that i often advocate is do

1073
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,800
you have strong partnerships with hr

1074
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,520
with legal with all these entities that

1075
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,240
you're going to need in a hurry once bad

1076
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,160
things happen and this would be bad

1077
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,359
right

1078
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,480
so that's uh yeah that's your your one

1079
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,680
pager strategy there and and failing to

1080
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,240
take action right really makes you and i

1081
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,520
heard this quote somewhere before i'm

1082
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,760
gonna paraphrase but it makes you this

1083
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,079
free arm of r d to all these companies

1084
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,359
out there that will just simply take

1085
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,760
your data right and it's really sad to

1086
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,320
see that and i see it so often and i

1087
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,359
don't see us getting better at this so

1088
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,040
hopefully this makes us a little bit

1089
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,240
better hopefully there's something there

1090
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,320
that you can take away and apply to your

1091
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,440
company

1092
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,760
to make you a little bit more safe and

1093
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,400
reduce this overall
