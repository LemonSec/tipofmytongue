00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,120
hi hello my name is michie brownish and

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,759
i'm a security consultant and i will try

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,000
to talk a bit about

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,560
how not to manage security related

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,080
incidents

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,320
first of all is anyone from gdynia

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,080
okay i was told that it is very

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,760
important to make a personal connection

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,039
with the play that you are in for

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,199
example acknowledge a local football

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,640
team so

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,960
and

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,239
okay but

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,440
i understand that you are after

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,280
lunch that people may be sleeping or

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,640
yawning and then sleeping or just

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,320
leaving

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,039
but

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,280
there will be a contest at the end so

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,840
stay tuned

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,800
i usually have problems with discussing

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,840
security because people tend to get by

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,600
incompetence very quickly

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,280
this time i will just blame

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,359
my poor english skills so try to bear

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,799
with me

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,479
first of all and that's the general

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,760
observation

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,240
people tend to lie during the audit and

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,320
people tend to lie during working with

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,920
the incident response team

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,840
i have no idea why

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,720
but

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,320
it is a very important issue because

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,400
very often

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,600
it takes you days to get to the root of

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
the problem because people tell to skip

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,200
the truth because it's easier for them

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,320
that way

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,920
and

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,640
challenger is a great

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
example of the problem because

44
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,640
very often within the organization you

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,880
understand the security issues that you

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,720
are having you understand that there is

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,880
a potential threat that can be exploited

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,119
by a malicious actor

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,600
and you very often tend to ignore it

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,280
because that's not your area of

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,119
expertise or that's not your team or

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,600
it's somebody else's problem and then

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,119
when

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,560
a significant amount of people will

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
ignore the issue that picture returns

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
him something like that

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,040
i came to one observation

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,520
regarding incident response teams that

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,199
when we are talking with the customer

61
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,280
the management of the customer we are

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,040
showing them what was wrong and what was

63
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,280
done in a bad manner and then we are

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,520
talking to the iit team or iit security

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,000
team and they said basically we told our

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,520
management the same stuff and they chose

67
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
to ignore us and the problem with

68
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,160
management is that very often

69
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,959
they

70
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,720
would rather listen somebody from

71
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,640
outside of the company even if he's

72
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
saying the same stuff that the local

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,840
stuff is so basically if you are id

74
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,360
either trust the people that you're

75
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,160
working with or fire them and get a new

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,879
team because it's

77
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,518
useless and

78
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,920
yeah that was me last night

79
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,920
and

80
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,160
some of the scenarios that i will show

81
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,480
in a minute seem quite funny

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,519
but

83
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,879
then again

84
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,400
when you think about them they are

85
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
rather depressing because they are

86
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
showing very very

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,760
simple examples of what might cause a

88
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,400
really critical problem and

89
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,519
the main issue is that we

90
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,239
tend to think that security is a very

91
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,319
complex issue and we need to put a lot

92
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,519
of effort

93
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,680
basically to cover all the areas of

94
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,920
security in the company and then

95
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,000
somebody tries to attack us and exploits

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
the easiest

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
way to to damage the company and we say

98
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,080
okay so basically maybe our strategy

99
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,799
that we need to cover or map the whole

100
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,120
area and then fix every mapped incident

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,519
was wrong and maybe we should basically

102
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,280
fix them one by one because that will

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,799
provide a significant improvement of

104
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,560
security

105
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
and uh very often people tend to do

106
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,640
stupid things i like to make photos when

107
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,159
i go to my customers offices and that is

108
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,519
one of them

109
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,959
there was a company

110
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,760
who implemented ubk 2fa because it

111
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
improves security but people tend to

112
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,159
lose the keys and the keys were rather

113
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,439
expensive so

114
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,120
the employees were asked to keep them on

115
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,319
their desk

116
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,760
because they will be saved that way

117
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,519
and

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,360
that didn't end well actually

119
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,238
uh

120
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,238
on the other hand it's a

121
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,040
screenshot from a real phishing attack

122
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,720
it was a physical attack that was sent

123
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
to one of my customers about two or

124
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,880
three weeks after the awareness training

125
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,639
that we conducted for them

126
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,000
and it was sent on a weekend and

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,919
the company ceo

128
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,720
called us very very angry monday morning

129
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,600
that it is very unprofessional of us to

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
force him to change his password during

131
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,880
the weekend because what would happen if

132
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,759
he

133
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,000
wasn't was absent and he didn't have

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
access to his computer fortunately for

135
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,759
him he had access to computer he changed

136
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,680
the password just wanted to

137
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,919
share his comments to us so we try to

138
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,600
help him and do the damage that he did

139
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,360
another example

140
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,759
i was working with a company that was

141
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,560
hacked and

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,400
one of the managers said basically we

143
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,560
put a lot of money in our security

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
infrastructure and we still get hacked

145
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,720
so it was some kind of very

146
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,120
high profile threat that bypassed

147
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,759
security and he said that they were

148
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,160
analyzing proactively monitoring the

149
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
security of the company and they had no

150
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,520
clue that anything bad will happen to

151
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,600
them and this is part of the logs from

152
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,360
their firewall and basically for like

153
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,440
three or four days before the attack

154
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,320
they had huge amount of connections from

155
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,919
tor relays

156
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,720
and

157
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
they had the information before if they

158
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,639
managed to get it

159
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,720
and basically look what the attractor

160
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,320
was accessing what systems he was

161
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,440
connecting

162
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,280
they would probably be able to avoid the

163
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,080
attack they didn't

164
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,960
when

165
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,680
companies try to think

166
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,440
about security in a structured way very

167
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,360
often they try to implement iso and

168
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,039
the problem is that

169
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,400
while iso 2701 is very helpful in

170
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,199
management security it very often

171
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,440
creates a false sense of security for

172
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,120
the company because we have iso

173
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,520
implemented so we are secure

174
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,199
and

175
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,560
i try to

176
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,479
explain to my customers okay you have a

177
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,120
very fast car you have insurance

178
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
and that still doesn't allow you to

179
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,199
break the law and right over speed limit

180
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,120
not because you will get a fine you can

181
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,960
pay the fine that's it but basically you

182
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,479
can get killed or kill somebody else and

183
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,319
that is the real problem

184
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,880
and uh

185
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,120
it is a screenshot from a real mail from

186
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,880
a company that was

187
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,919
recertifying their eso certification

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,160
and because the company data center was

189
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
of sight and because it was during the

190
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,840
pandemic so the auditing team decided to

191
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,039
conduct the audit remotely

192
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,199
basically to fill the forms and they

193
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,599
have sent the form with the

194
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,680
separate document with the key so that

195
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,360
all the answers would be correct and

196
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,840
they could re-certify the company

197
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,400
this is a checklist that very

198
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,520
often companies have regarding security

199
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,680
they have all the right components they

200
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
have all the right stuff

201
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,400
and there is a

202
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,840
spreadsheet on someone's computer and

203
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,280
there's a printed document stating that

204
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,039
we are secure that we have addressed all

205
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,440
the issues and requirements for a

206
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,840
company to manage security

207
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,000
the one that i'm

208
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,520
really curious about is the next

209
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,360
generation firewalls are with us for

210
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,400
like 15 years now and i

211
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,720
wonder when they won't become what won't

212
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,599
be

213
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,400
next generation

214
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,880
and very often that lists

215
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,840
look something like that because we have

216
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,560
basically everyone checked except the

217
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
guy that need to conduct the work

218
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
and

219
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,319
sometimes companies

220
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,720
are security compliant on paper and when

221
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,120
you try to scratch a bit then you see

222
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,720
that basically

223
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,280
it is just a false impression creating

224
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,759
either to make it management happy or

225
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
just keep the management happy

226
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,039
and

227
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,639
this is the screenshot from a mail

228
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,599
server

229
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,120
of one of the companies that was hacked

230
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,879
and i was working with them they had all

231
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,639
the notifications regarding somebody

232
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,080
trying to

233
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,120
exploit them but the notifications were

234
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,280
being sent in so significant amount that

235
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,639
they decided just to filter it and

236
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,879
nobody care to look at them

237
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,680
and

238
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,400
it is really a problem because when you

239
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,479
have all the security systems and they

240
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,599
send you like 100 notifications a day

241
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,360
they aren't tuned well

242
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,880
and they provide you with information

243
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,599
that are rather useless or your network

244
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,159
is really unsecure but mostly the

245
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,519
problem is that you get a lot of

246
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,000
big amount of information that is

247
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,640
unrelevant or the system isn't tuned

248
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,040
properly so maybe if you are struggling

249
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,600
with the problem that you get like uh

250
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,800
two or three hundred security

251
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,399
notifications a day

252
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,399
you should retune the system and you

253
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,800
will get only the notification that you

254
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,040
can look into and they provide you with

255
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,519
information that is

256
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,120
really really helpful

257
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,000
and

258
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
apart from that you just have a really

259
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
false sense of security

260
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,880
the problem is that very often when you

261
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,360
try to find a person that is responsible

262
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,839
for security organization

263
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,080
there isn't one

264
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,720
still in poland majority of companies

265
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,240
claim that security is i.t related issue

266
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,839
and it is very hard to

267
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,920
analyze your own work in terms of

268
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,839
security i know that it causes a lot of

269
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,120
stress in the company when you have a

270
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,720
separate security team that basically

271
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
points at iit team saying that you are

272
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,800
doing this and this and that's bad

273
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,800
but that's the only way if you try to be

274
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,279
your own auditor and your own

275
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,040
security team

276
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,480
the majority of the results will be

277
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,920
useless

278
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,720
and

279
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
on the other hand

280
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,000
security is very

281
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,560
important in media and basically every

282
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,360
day we get informations about uh another

283
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
security system bridge like two hours

284
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,040
ago there is information that

285
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,800
polish peso

286
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,680
register registered peso registry was

287
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,399
hacked

288
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,160
or the data was leaked from the database

289
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,959
so basically everyone knows about

290
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,720
security and

291
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,839
at least claims that it is very

292
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,440
important for the company

293
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
so you run the team

294
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,880
so you try to create a team that will

295
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,320
potentially solve the problem but very

296
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,240
often the team stays only on paper

297
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,959
and

298
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,079
the main issue is that we forget that

299
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,000
i.t security and basically incident

300
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,240
management isn't just the issue for for

301
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,200
it

302
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,959
first of all you need to have management

303
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,640
involved because there is somebody that

304
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,240
will make a decision and the decision

305
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
very often influences the future

306
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,959
financial future of the company

307
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,480
in the really

308
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,640
significant amount you need the legal

309
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,399
team because with gdpr and other legal

310
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,480
frameworks that you need to work with

311
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,200
you just can skip them and you need a pr

312
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,959
team to communicate

313
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,519
and if you have those force elements for

314
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,000
all elements you

315
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,880
have a quite large chance to survive the

316
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,160
incident

317
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,839
even better if the company

318
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,399
yeah that picture is creepy

319
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,160
even better if the company not only

320
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
creates the team but forces the team to

321
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,040
work

322
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,959
before the incident happened

323
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,800
very often i am

324
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,399
called to accompany because they have an

325
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,440
incident

326
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,519
and i meet people from the security

327
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,120
management team or resident response

328
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,040
team and after a few minutes of talking

329
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,200
i understand that they have just met or

330
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,040
it is the first time they are talking to

331
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,600
each other in person in years but on

332
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,760
paper they have a security team

333
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,079
and the problem is that every person in

334
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,079
the team is very valuable but on the

335
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,560
other hand can screw things up very

336
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
quickly uh

337
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,320
very often there is an i.t manager or

338
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,240
the manager who claims he knows

339
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,480
technical stuff because he was an i.t

340
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,320
administrator like 25 years ago

341
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,680
and i have seen

342
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
such incidents when the management for

343
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,000
example instructed the iit team to

344
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
immediately shut down the cloud

345
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,560
environment because there is a possible

346
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,839
incident

347
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,720
the possible incident turned out to be

348
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,519
an mpl is issue with the network core so

349
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,519
basically it was not security related

350
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,639
but

351
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,560
putting the environment back online took

352
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,040
the team like two days and two days of

353
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,320
the company it is absent from the

354
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,760
internet caused them like significant

355
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,639
amount of trouble

356
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,680
there is a great pr strategy claiming

357
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,120
don't tell anyone

358
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,560
nothing bad will happen and nobody will

359
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,040
leave this information to the press

360
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,399
and very often people tend to do it even

361
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,399
in spite of the situation where

362
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,560
they were informed about the incident by

363
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,279
regular employees somewhere in poland

364
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,600
and they still claim that they can keep

365
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,040
the information

366
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,720
in a closed circuit and nobody else will

367
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,880
know that it's not a good strategy and

368
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,240
if you can't get it out you basically

369
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,920
deprive yourself of a chance to control

370
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,600
the narration because you're not the one

371
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,959
that provide information and you are

372
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,839
instantly put on the defensive

373
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,480
then again we have legal team

374
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,200
and

375
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,360
there is a joke about legal people and a

376
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,279
good start but i won't tell it because

377
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,040
it's stream online

378
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,480
uh

379
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,639
but the problem is that very often the

380
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,760
legal staff tends to focus on the

381
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,360
formalities

382
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,120
ignoring the reality i have seen a

383
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,760
customer that had a data center

384
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,079
flooded like a regular flood and water

385
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,240
pouring into the data center and the

386
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,959
legal team started by freezing the iit

387
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,120
staff and forcing them to fill out a

388
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,639
bunch of documents regarding a

389
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,880
possibility security incident

390
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,959
or inevitability of the infrastructure

391
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,519
in the company

392
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,940
okay i know i was boring but

393
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,839
[Laughter]

394
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,240
and the last one is my favorite

395
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,399
i know that everyone

396
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,120
here has a person in i.t that claims to

397
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,720
be the smartest

398
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
and it is very

399
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,600
crucial to understand that claiming that

400
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,440
i know everything and everything but

401
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,160
that

402
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,000
that happened isn't my fault it's not a

403
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,920
good strategy you have a problem you

404
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
need to handle it and not to basically

405
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,199
put the blame on somebody else

406
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,639
there is another problem and

407
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,760
very often

408
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,160
i see security or forensics companies

409
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,320
asking the company for example to shut

410
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,920
down the infrastructure for like five

411
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,279
five days because they need to create

412
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,760
forensic images of their servers for

413
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,199
future analysis

414
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,880
and the company says that it is not

415
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,959
possible because they need to work they

416
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,959
would rather risk

417
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,800
uh being

418
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,959
online with the system that was hacked

419
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,120
than being out of business for five days

420
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,199
because very often after that five days

421
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,079
you they can they have no

422
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,839
use of coming back because that's it for

423
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,000
them and the problem is that

424
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
all of these issues should be discussed

425
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,519
beforehand and if you

426
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,120
just make a scenario that for example

427
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,600
you can be hacked and somebody

428
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,399
probably would ask you for uh images of

429
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,519
your data from your servers for analysis

430
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,800
you should think about it before the

431
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,560
incident happen and maybe there is a

432
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,880
track where you can just make copies of

433
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,199
data or something like that and be able

434
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,279
to survive that process because very

435
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,320
often

436
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,839
making the decision

437
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,839
do we shut down do we stay up and

438
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,680
basically risk

439
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,519
future trouble is is very difficult for

440
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,399
the company

441
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,120
and there isn't a good choice

442
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,720
i like that people

443
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,160
claim that they have

444
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,839
incident response plans and when the

445
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,040
incident happened they just need to

446
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,120
follow the procedure

447
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,800
very often the procedure is perfect on

448
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,440
paper and nobody had verified it and

449
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,199
it's great looking at

450
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,279
the procedure and for example asking how

451
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,880
old the procedure is and when it was

452
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,120
last updated and i very often see

453
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,720
procedures that are like 10 or 15 years

454
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,399
and if that's the case with you then you

455
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,120
are

456
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,639
in a bit of a problem

457
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,639
and on the other hand you can have

458
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,399
procedures and

459
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,000
and still ignore them

460
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,440
because it is easier because

461
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,519
users have problems with it or other way

462
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,560
around

463
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,399
i work with the company once who

464
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,040
implemented a very strict

465
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,519
no remote logging policy

466
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,279
and even if you wanted to access the

467
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,600
system from a remote site like from your

468
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,680
home you need to

469
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,040
be allowed for like one hour

470
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,519
you need to use like sms based

471
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,759
authentication all that stuff

472
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,399
and on paper it was very secure and the

473
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,800
problem is that people needed to

474
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,560
work remotely because the company

475
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,480
business model depended on that

476
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,880
so suddenly they started creating a

477
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,560
bunch of gmail accounts

478
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,040
and sharing data on google drive and

479
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,480
basically the it infrastructure of the

480
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,640
company in terms of data was copied to

481
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,839
google cloud

482
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,480
with no security no maintenance but the

483
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,240
iit security was very happy that they

484
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,720
have no incidents no data breaches no

485
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,959
leaks until a leak happened

486
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,880
from the source that were they were not

487
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,679
aware of at the moment

488
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,919
the slide has nothing to do with it

489
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,160
security apart from i think i was

490
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,799
called to customers like few weeks ago

491
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,880
and then i spent like two hours in the

492
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,679
conference room play games

493
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,600
because they had their intranet

494
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,160
encrypted by ransomware and they were

495
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,880
trying to find a paper copy of the nda

496
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,640
that i was supposed to sign

497
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,679
so i would be able to help them

498
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
it's actually cool because

499
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,440
when i was a kid it was my dream to be

500
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,400
paid hourly playing games

501
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
so that happened in a way

502
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,199
yeah and the problem is that uh

503
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,039
the strategies regarding for example

504
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,280
ransomware still need to be updated

505
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,919
because uh even if your strategy says

506
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,640
okay we can pay the ransom suddenly

507
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
after february the reality changed

508
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
because if the company

509
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
is attacked by ransomware group that is

510
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,280
russian based it is not so easy to to

511
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,799
pay ransom

512
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,799
because you'll be breaking sanctions and

513
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,520
working way around it is very difficult

514
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,440
and extremely difficult if you don't

515
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,679
want to break the law

516
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,520
and

517
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,240
apart from that

518
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
there are situations where you feel safe

519
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,039
because you have a failover system

520
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,600
for example your data center has a

521
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,280
backup data center or you have a diesel

522
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
engine to provide electricity in terms

523
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,240
of

524
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,080
energy lag

525
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,919
and the problem is that nobody tests

526
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,160
those failover mechanisms

527
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
as i was

528
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,120
asked

529
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,200
to a customer because they had a data

530
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,000
loss

531
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,720
and the data loss was basically created

532
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,360
by themselves because they wanted to try

533
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,440
switching to their backup data centers

534
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,039
they shut down

535
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,440
the electricity primary building and it

536
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,360
turns out that powering up the machines

537
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,960
caused the failure in the data center

538
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,679
that was secondary so suddenly they were

539
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,360
they had two data centers both down

540
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,960
so

541
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,760
it turns to be difficult uh

542
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,960
and

543
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,480
very often the problem is that we don't

544
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,400
communicate and we don't show

545
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,919
information

546
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,160
a few years ago i was working with the

547
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,720
data breach

548
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,919
that was handled by an in-house legal

549
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,440
team in the company

550
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,520
and they weren't

551
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,679
as nice and lawyer as licensed lawyers

552
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,120
can be

553
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
and when we inform them that they have

554
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,000
like

555
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,720
legal obligation to inform the gdpr

556
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,520
office in poland about the incident they

557
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,600
responded that they will decide when

558
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,280
they have enough information to be sure

559
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,039
that they probably can suspect an

560
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,679
incident they didn't care to consult

561
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,320
with their own i.t team because it was

562
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,240
below them to discuss anything with

563
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,720
anybody apart from their own team

564
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,960
and in the meantime the iit team decided

565
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,440
to contact the police and file a legal

566
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,760
claim that they were hacked and

567
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
basically the clock started a day

568
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,039
earlier so

569
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,720
that causes a bit of a problem

570
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,520
sometimes customers tend to behave in an

571
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,840
surprising way

572
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,559
once i had a company that detected that

573
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,880
they were being hacked by a guy from

574
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,760
their

575
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,799
outsourcing it team basically he was

576
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,240
taking data from their system and

577
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,360
providing the data to the competition

578
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,600
and when we provided evidence the

579
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
management the management asked us to

580
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,240
contact the guy that was behind the

581
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,120
bridge

582
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
and ask him how much money would it take

583
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,240
for him to

584
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,440
work the other way around

585
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,120
so that was surprising actually

586
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,760
and

587
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,919
then again as long as we have procedures

588
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,280
and we

589
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,080
don't try them in real life or basically

590
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,000
we give them to anybody else for

591
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,320
verification a critical verification to

592
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
be precise

593
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,720
we can have a very weird scenario where

594
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,799
there was a company where

595
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,000
they fired the item manager they

596
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,760
conducted the security policy blocking

597
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,559
his

598
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,320
account personal account blocking his

599
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,400
vpn all that stuff and they were even

600
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,840
saying jokes that the guy is weird

601
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,520
because the guy was fired and the guy

602
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,120
still comes to the office and sits in

603
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,200
the lobby for the whole day

604
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,960
and what the guy was doing was accessing

605
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,799
the company public wi-fi that was in the

606
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,880
building and using his administrator

607
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,120
account he was just logging onto servers

608
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,919
and extracting data

609
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,039
to basically sell them to the

610
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,880
competition so

611
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,320
everything was fine in terms of the

612
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,158
procedure and still the patient died

613
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,960
yeah and

614
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,760
the problem with management of the

615
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,879
company is that

616
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,799
in poland there is a world near virginia

617
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,679
and

618
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,000
for some years it means basically

619
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,280
someday

620
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,320
and

621
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,880
and that is the problem i sometimes get

622
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
emails from the customers who require

623
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,880
immediate help and they can shut the

624
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,880
meeting in like two weeks

625
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,640
or for example they have a meeting and

626
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,240
decided that the meeting should be

627
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,400
conducted again with a larger amount of

628
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
people involved

629
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,159
so when we get to work basically there's

630
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,159
nothing more we can do but

631
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,840
to sell the customers that say the

632
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,080
customer it is too late

633
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,760
and

634
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,200
on the other hand there is a huge

635
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,840
economical factor in terms of security

636
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,559
and

637
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,200
i know very few companies who understand

638
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,919
the security is a cost but is also an

639
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,840
investment and the security is a process

640
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,919
this is not enough to just buy a

641
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,760
security device claiming we have a

642
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,520
security based device we have utm we

643
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
have a firewall so we are secure it

644
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,039
doesn't work that way

645
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,880
and sometimes customer

646
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,640
acknowledge that for example they have

647
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,120
security devices without support without

648
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,240
updates

649
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,640
but but they still have them uh some

650
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,159
time ago i was

651
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,280
auditing a company that conducted

652
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,400
regular yearly based uh

653
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,720
penetration testing and the penetration

654
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,039
testing procedure uh was working like

655
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,039
that they were giving a document with

656
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,679
the list of detected vulnerabilities and

657
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,799
threats and the company required that

658
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,760
the

659
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,320
all the potential vulnerabilities would

660
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,440
be

661
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,919
named or labeled in a particular manner

662
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,279
and that the guy that was managing the

663
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,960
i.t in the company who just make a

664
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,640
document with all the

665
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,080
vulnerability numbers and put it on a

666
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,159
form stating that he acknowledges all

667
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,279
the risks

668
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,960
coming from that vulnerabilities and he

669
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,799
did it every year so they conducted the

670
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,880
audit did nothing about it everything

671
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,240
was fine until they were hacked

672
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,000
and

673
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,080
sometimes you can find a security issue

674
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,760
that is old enough to vote and

675
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,120
sometimes you

676
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,799
look at the company security it's a

677
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,720
screenshot from a real installation of

678
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,960
nasus to one of the company that i uh

679
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,559
worked with and

680
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,559
the ite the security team

681
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,520
had

682
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,240
scanned their network infrastructure

683
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,679
very regularly

684
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,440
at least once a month and basically do

685
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,120
nothing about it but the scan was

686
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,799
conducted because the procedure demanded

687
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,039
so and that's it

688
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,600
as you can see the amount of critical

689
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,080
issues is basically higher

690
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,600
uh every

691
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,760
uh

692
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,360
every month and the problem is that uh

693
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,120
sometimes customers say okay we are too

694
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,720
small to get hacked or we are not

695
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,480
interesting target or basically nobody

696
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,240
will pay attention to us

697
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,400
and that is very often not true

698
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
if you are a business

699
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,080
then in terms of somebody that is a

700
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,080
malicious actor he doesn't know your

701
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,279
financial

702
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,760
situation he is not aware that you

703
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,159
may not be able to pay ransom

704
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,080
he will invest those few days to hack

705
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,679
you even if that won't provide him any

706
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,559
profit so basically being uninteresting

707
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,840
isn't a situation that

708
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,678
can be self-explanatory uh

709
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,320
there is a person that should be

710
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,559
thanked for this slide actually here

711
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,960
uh but

712
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,279
like two weeks two years ago we had an

713
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,039
incident

714
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,799
where the guy that was basically

715
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,640
migrating a website of a customer from

716
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,120
one server to another us git and forgot

717
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,760
to remove the dot git directory

718
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,200
and the information with people

719
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,760
peso numbers all the personal data was

720
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,679
stored in that git repository

721
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,640
and

722
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,480
when we said okay that probably is a

723
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,919
problem and we started scanning the

724
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,039
company servers for that particular type

725
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,279
of data leak we were

726
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,679
a bit astonished to find that they had

727
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,919
the problem on like few dozen servers

728
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,159
and majority of them contained

729
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,760
personal information because it's very

730
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,120
cool to just

731
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,799
create a

732
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,039
dump of a database with

733
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,960
tens of thousands of data

734
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
regarding real people and then just

735
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,440
leave it on a git directory

736
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,919
how many of you use ipv6 in production

737
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,799
i will probably die because

738
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,039
yeah

739
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
like 20 years ago i was at a lecture

740
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,159
where a guy that was responsible the

741
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,760
four published six bones said that

742
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,360
basically we will all be dead before

743
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,720
ipv6 will be a dominant network protocol

744
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,679
and he is unfortunately right

745
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,080
there is a problem with ipv6 because the

746
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
majority of people

747
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,240
that use it forget it that it is a

748
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,559
different network stack and very often

749
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,039
there is a problem where you have tens

750
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,960
of thousands of firewall rules regarding

751
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,679
ipv4 and you have no security and ipv6

752
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,600
and when we do pen testing it is very

753
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,880
often the easiest way to access the

754
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,960
company network because the security of

755
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,360
ipv6 is

756
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,120
non-existent to put it mildly

757
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,039
and

758
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,039
on the other hand even if you have

759
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,360
security procedure implemented

760
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,960
we worked once with the data center a

761
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,039
large data center with a huge amount of

762
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,159
cool certifications and tier 1 labels

763
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,600
very nice place

764
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
and we were given an

765
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,279
information that we should configure our

766
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,679
devices to use vlan 42

767
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,080
and we decided okay let's try any other

768
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,880
vlan or run g3rp

769
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,640
on on that

770
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
port and suddenly we were able for

771
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
example to access the management network

772
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,080
of that data center

773
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,679
and the security of their juniper

774
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,520
routers were basically non-existent

775
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,360
because they were in a secure villain

776
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,520
that nobody else has access to apart

777
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,360
from the guy that turns to use the

778
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,480
different villain that he's supposed to

779
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,279
and that works that way

780
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,240
there was a

781
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,720
issue with the network traffic on one of

782
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,559
the companies that we were asked to work

783
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,440
for

784
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,559
they were paying huge amounts of uh

785
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,559
money for the outgoing traffic and

786
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,559
basically they had no business case that

787
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,480
would justify that

788
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,720
and

789
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,880
well it was data it was encrypted

790
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,760
basically it is hard to distinguish what

791
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,320
the data actually is but if you try to

792
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,039
google the company ip addresses

793
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,279
you find out that they have an iptv

794
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,799
service providing hd and 4k services for

795
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,080
free for everybody in the internet

796
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,679
so if you for example want to watch

797
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,000
polish television in hd i don't know why

798
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,720
that was actually possible

799
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,960
and

800
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,600
the team that was responsible for the

801
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,840
tv service claimed that they weren't

802
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,440
responsible for security they provided

803
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,960
the service the service was working

804
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,200
everybody could watch tv and if you need

805
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
to provide security that's not their

806
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,720
problem so

807
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,799
that's how it works

808
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,640
i like the meaning of asap

809
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,840
it is a really email from a real

810
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,799
customer that

811
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,919
took

812
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,080
more than a month to contact us because

813
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,320
the issue was critical and i even asked

814
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,240
them why it took them so much time and

815
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,919
they said that they were

816
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,600
holding meetings discussing which

817
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,320
company they should contact

818
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,120
so

819
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,440
it was really a funny situation because

820
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,840
when we agreed to work with them they

821
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,240
sent us

822
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,120
disks with images from vmware from their

823
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,440
data center for analysis and i call them

824
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,640
like a j and say okay the package

825
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,039
arrived but you are missing one

826
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,279
server there is one active directory

827
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,679
controller that we don't have an image

828
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,440
and they said no that's not possible we

829
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,360
have three id controller we have sent

830
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,919
you three images no no you have four

831
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,919
and after a brief discussion

832
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,760
we found out that the

833
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,159
intruder hacked their network

834
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,240
installed another windows machine under

835
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,720
vmware connected to the reactive

836
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,840
directory and tested

837
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,320
policy scripts to infect the whole

838
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
network with the ransomware and when he

839
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,520
was able to have a satisfactional result

840
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,600
he started the script rebooted all the

841
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,440
machines infected all the

842
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,640
computers and that was it for the

843
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,960
company but it took him like two months

844
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,919
so basically the it team in the company

845
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,919
didn't notice another active directory

846
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,919
server for like two months within the

847
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,679
their own data center and they didn't

848
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,760
have like 2000 servers they have like a

849
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,399
dozen so

850
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,679
and

851
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,960
sometime ago we had a problem with a

852
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,200
company that was

853
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,399
unable to conduct sales in their

854
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,960
shops they had shops all over poland and

855
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,080
basically the internal network was down

856
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,679
the internal network was down because

857
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,519
the

858
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,360
windows machines were infected by some

859
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,720
kind of ransomware

860
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,080
and the point of entry was uh off-site

861
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,640
data center data center was in the house

862
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,799
of ceo of the company because

863
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,559
like 20 years ago he used to manage the

864
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,799
it for the company so even if it was

865
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,640
outsourced now he still had an active

866
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,120
directory controller on his home as a

867
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,880
computer that his kids were able to

868
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,760
access to watch videos on youtube and

869
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,440
download some from the internet so

870
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,399
and

871
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,080
oh sorry

872
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,799
very often the problem with security is

873
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,960
entity related and it's very hard for us

874
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,600
to remember that because we tend to look

875
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,559
for a

876
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,600
i.t security

877
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,840
solution

878
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,640
and

879
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,480
basically we expect the problem would be

880
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,360
i.t

881
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,120
and sometimes it's really not sometimes

882
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,720
it's just a human factor there was a

883
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
customer who contacted us because there

884
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,159
were people

885
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,559
stealing from them and he thought that

886
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,200
somebody had breached his

887
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,960
access management system

888
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,080
and the

889
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,919
log

890
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,360
from the access management system

891
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,120
basically looked like that

892
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
and the guy

893
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,320
that would

894
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,679
leave the gate

895
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,960
and then

896
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,720
like a few minutes later would access

897
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,600
the data center with either teleport or

898
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,679
there is a b location available from

899
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,640
some saints so there were two choices

900
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,519
and

901
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,720
the problem

902
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,679
was

903
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:42,880
quite simple

904
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,880
the company was

905
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,440
so to say not eager to spend any money

906
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,120
on updating systems

907
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,919
so

908
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,480
the go-to mechanism for adding new

909
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,799
access point from users was basically

910
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,399
this

911
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,080
and people noticed that you can just

912
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,440
clone the card

913
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,240
um

914
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,440
so they did

915
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,799
and

916
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,640
when we asked the it team to provide

917
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
their cards for analysis

918
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,120
the whole id team was like 25 to 30

919
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,640
people all of them were using the same

920
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,720
card with the same id and basically

921
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,559
every employee that left the company had

922
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,960
like two or three cards with him

923
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,480
so there was no

924
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,559
we are unable to control basically who

925
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,320
entered who left and

926
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,960
what is the

927
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,640
and we asked the manager of the company

928
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,440
okay but you still probably have cameras

929
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,519
and we can

930
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,600
analyze the videos and basically

931
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,320
point what person access the company who

932
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,840
shouldn't be able to

933
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,360
and they responded that they have no

934
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,120
cameras within the building because they

935
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,600
respect the privacy of the workers very

936
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,640
much

937
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,480
and it is great to respect

938
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,720
privacy but it's even greater waiter to

939
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,120
respect security as well

940
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,919
okay so basically that is an image that

941
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,559
all of us seen sometime in our life

942
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,919
and we understand

943
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,080
how that should work

944
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,000
and very often if

945
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,960
the it team behaves like a

946
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,280
message operator from hell

947
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,320
people tend to avoid it teams

948
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,918
sometimes i'm working with customers and

949
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,679
the customers are asking could we just

950
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,280
not contact the it team because we don't

951
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,839
want to want to work with

952
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,199
them and if you don't work want to work

953
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,719
with your it team there is something

954
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,639
very very wrong with the company

955
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,159
but there was a company that implemented

956
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,320
that model that was very secure that all

957
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,480
the systems were

958
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,320
filtered by a firewall the access was

959
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,760
restricted to the site that you should

960
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,239
be able to access all that stuff

961
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,560
and then there was a bypass

962
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,199
and basically like each other department

963
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,719
was able to

964
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,199
order their own internet access

965
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,359
accepted by their own manager

966
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,000
and the security in the company was

967
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,480
non-existent that switch you can see in

968
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,239
the back was basically a suite that was

969
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,280
breeding

970
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,159
uh

971
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,760
all the network the internal network of

972
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
the company and that

973
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,800
we

974
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,400
kind of dmz that

975
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,599
that was

976
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,839
that was created

977
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,000
okay and

978
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,240
before i bore you to death

979
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,000
there are a few things you

980
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,440
i would hope at least you should

981
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,359
remember because it might help you at

982
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,520
some point first of all yeah having a

983
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,920
written protocol procedure is great but

984
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,200
testing it

985
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,240
analyzing it and putting it to some open

986
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,320
critic is even better

987
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,079
very often a good procedure is to just

988
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,359
show

989
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,960
your procedures to the employer

990
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
employees and say okay

991
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,320
what do you don't like about that

992
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,839
procedure or what should you change if

993
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,040
you have people that are working with

994
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,800
the company then probably they care

995
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,720
about the company a bit so basically try

996
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,000
to

997
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,760
benefit from that

998
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,079
if you are lying during the audit or

999
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,240
during an incident response that's your

1000
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,839
problem we don't care we will bill you

1001
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,320
either way and that's it you are just

1002
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,920
wasting your time and basically you are

1003
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,160
putting yourself at risk

1004
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,280
that's for you to decide uh

1005
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,160
it is very often better to

1006
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,240
think for a moment be before doing

1007
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,119
something

1008
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,079
uh

1009
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,040
i know that incident response tend to ha

1010
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,839
have like an emergency feeling that you

1011
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,000
need to make decisions very quickly and

1012
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,800
that's not usually the case very often

1013
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,720
you see a situation where you really

1014
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,920
really don't have that 15 minutes to

1015
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,520
think about the problem find a different

1016
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,920
approach analyze what is bad in the idea

1017
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,119
that you just created and want to

1018
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,640
implement so

1019
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,400
it is really great to just think for a

1020
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,320
moment before you do something that is

1021
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,200
for example irreversible

1022
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,720
you're not the only person that means

1023
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,320
well and you're not the only person that

1024
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,839
cares about the company

1025
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,320
while working in it we tend to have an

1026
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,160
approach that we are the smartest and

1027
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,640
everybody apart from us is dumb

1028
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,160
the business doesn't know what they are

1029
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,599
doing lawyers don't know what they are

1030
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,599
doing etc etc

1031
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,440
that is not usually the case even if you

1032
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,920
are the smartest there are pretty smart

1033
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,720
people in the company in every area and

1034
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,800
we should at least listen to them before

1035
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,400
we do anything

1036
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,359
and

1037
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,520
don't be afraid to ask for help

1038
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,640
if you

1039
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,400
are unsure about the security of your

1040
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,160
network or you have issues that you

1041
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,640
aren't able to handle yourself

1042
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,200
it is really a better idea to ask for

1043
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,880
help before something that happened then

1044
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,040
find somebody who will just

1045
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,400
provide you with assistance where you

1046
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,839
have a huge incident and just try to

1047
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,599
