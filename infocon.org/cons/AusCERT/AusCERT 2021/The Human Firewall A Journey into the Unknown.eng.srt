00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,039
interview you interrogation was a past

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,879
life you know some habits are hard to

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,480
break yeah right so we're just going to

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,000
have a chat just think if this is a

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
chat with a friendly soul sitting beside

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,600
you i know you too well brian

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,519
is that right you know i'm talking

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,080
crackers my lips are moving

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,840
but look you know from my background

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,479
it's very important that i did a bit of

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,159
research on you

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,600
and i've gotta

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,720
i came across this anomaly so

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
luke could you just share that video

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,119
please

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
well

40
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:55,840
i know what's going on

41
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,370
[Applause]

42
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,840
[Applause]

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
hey

44
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,790
[Applause]

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,680
okay what the hell was that what

46
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,239
happened

47
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,800
firstly can i just say with a background

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,000
in training

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
i always think every embarrassing moment

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,080
we can find some kind of unique learning

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,599
experience we've got three we can pull

52
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,319
from this

53
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,400
one social media never forgets anything

54
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,920
so what you put up there or what other

55
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,120
people put up there

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,239
can come back to want you number two if

57
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,920
anyone wants to socially engineer me

58
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,360
after today's session

59
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,440
just send me an email the link in it

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
going how to get revenge on or cert

61
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,200
co-host

62
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,640
that will probably work i'll open that

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,959
one probably right now

64
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,519
and actually i think i think three is

65
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,440
that lady that joined me in that dance

66
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
she is 70 years old

67
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,560
and so what i'd like to say is when i'm

68
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
doing my training awareness programs

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,000
um i like to have fun i love to have fun

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,280
and i think that you have passion for

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,440
something and you're excited about it

72
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,040
um and you try and have fun other people

73
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,040
will come and join that journey with you

74
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
um as you could see from beryl getting

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,120
up there and doing that dance with me

76
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,599
so thank you brian that's a great way to

77
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,360
start but that actually rotation

78
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,720
the first thing went through my mind is

79
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,319
you know boot scoot and line dancing

80
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,080
then it's sort of like another human

81
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,319
version of mad cow disease

82
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,400
i'm done line dancing tomorrow when i go

83
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,159
home yes and you admitted that in front

84
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,720
of a

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,400
thousand people in the audience they

86
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,080
love it

87
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,280
so tell me how did you get into um cyber

88
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,120
safety and cyber security safety and

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,159
social security so

90
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,920
um the really interesting thing is i've

91
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,360
been with queensland health for

92
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,480
27 years please don't do the maths i

93
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,599
started when i was 11. that's what i

94
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,760
like to tell everybody because we don't

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
want to reveal my age right now

96
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,280
but i actually come from a

97
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,959
administration background and then moved

98
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,040
into a training awareness background

99
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,519
so when an opportunity came up to work

100
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,080
with information security i was like

101
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,120
i'll give this a shot and i have no

102
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,720
technical experience so

103
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,320
they brought me on board because of my

104
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,839
training background because i wanted to

105
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,479
start

106
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,080
delivering some security awareness

107
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,759
training at the time to queensland

108
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,120
health staff

109
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,759
and they gave me a go mainly because

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,639
they thought i was a bit

111
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,479
bit out there and a bit strange and they

112
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,680
thought i might bring something unique

113
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,840
and different to the team

114
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,199
well in my limited experience i'd

115
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,280
suggest you they've made the right

116
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,639
choice

117
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,320
it's been 10 years on this journey now

118
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
so so it is a journey

119
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,960
and and people are a journey and it begs

120
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,520
a question

121
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
here i see lots of words going around

122
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,040
about cyber awareness

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,720
and i see lots of words around cyber

124
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
culture so how do you distinguish

125
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
or do you distinguish a difference

126
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,160
between awareness and culture

127
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,400
100 so when we're talking about

128
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,000
awareness especially

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,759
in the context we're doing i like to

130
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,520
think of that as what do our staff need

131
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,199
to know to get their job done so

132
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,960
we have policy process governance what

133
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,240
are the rules that they need to follow

134
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,960
to keep our organization safe

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,120
and to meet that need we've got our

136
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,720
baseline cyber security awareness

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,280
training

138
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,919
but culture is a whole nother thing so

139
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,840
what we want to do is move away from

140
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,080
what they need to know and actually have

141
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,120
them doing

142
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,680
um work that you know they will actually

143
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
call out other people and say

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,759
that's a bad cyber security behavior

145
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,360
that's a good cyber security behavior

146
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,400
and they're actually bringing those

147
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,880
practices into work yeah probably

148
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
one of the things for me and i don't

149
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
want to cast any dispersions upon

150
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,840
my previous career but there are you

151
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,520
know the difference between awareness

152
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,440
and culture to me is we see that in

153
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,639
queensland's been a lot of media

154
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,840
recently about

155
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,560
a police officer pulling over a

156
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,759
victorian officer and then there was a

157
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,680
discussion that let them go

158
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,479
that officer was aware of what the

159
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,960
protest processes were

160
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,800
but does the culture reflect they didn't

161
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,400
follow those processes and took another

162
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,800
step

163
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,880
and was there a subculture that played

164
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,160
to neither and to me

165
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,080
awareness is one thing culture is when

166
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,919
you it's more like an instinctive

167
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,520
intuitive behavioral

168
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,400
process that becomes a standard you know

169
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,520
absolutely

170
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,440
um and i think as well an organization

171
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,039
as large as the one that i work in in

172
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,160
the healthcare industry

173
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,919
there are many so different subcultures

174
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,240
as well so some will already be good

175
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,919
there'll be some that aren't so great we

176
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,759
need to look at the organization's

177
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,840
culture towards cyber security as well

178
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,520
so we have a lot of learnings to do on

179
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,039
that environment as well to try and

180
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,319
create a program that's going to be so

181
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,919
multifaceted that we can actually attack

182
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,199
all those different elements

183
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,440
so it is a challenge to try and attack

184
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,199
all those different elements at once or

185
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,039
you you focus on some core issues and

186
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,479
expand out absolutely

187
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,479
it's like adding an elephant one

188
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,479
spoonful of it one spoonful at a time

189
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,360
absolutely

190
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,720
and this is a journey like we've been on

191
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,280
for 10 years so we've started out with

192
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,080
our program

193
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,240
and doing some basic work i was there by

194
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,759
myself in the initial

195
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,199
part of that and would spend a lot of

196
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,280
time cutting out bookmarks

197
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,080
and coasters and doing things like that

198
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,919
so now i've down the back there i've got

199
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,919
kim and devlin who have joined my team

200
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,639
and have

201
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,639
helped us to to create some wonderful

202
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,599
stuff that you'll see throughout the

203
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,240
presentation

204
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,599
so what i've got queensland health's got

205
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,520
about a hundred thousand people here

206
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,639
a complete diverse environment rural

207
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,680
very rural very very remote and so many

208
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,960
different disciplines as well

209
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,440
so so how do you work within making the

210
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,360
priorities on what you're going to focus

211
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,160
on when

212
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,000
and where yeah that's a really great

213
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,599
question too so

214
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,199
when we're starting out obviously like

215
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,120
we have our baseline e-learning program

216
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800
which is a great way to get

217
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,639
that that standard training where

218
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,319
everyone needs to know

219
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,840
and then we go out and we talk with all

220
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,440
the different areas within our hospital

221
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,240
health services

222
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,599
and actually try and understand their

223
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,080
needs and then try and build some unique

224
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,280
programs around that

225
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,560
a good example of what we're doing at

226
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,160
the moment is working with the research

227
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,639
team

228
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,160
in one of our large hospitals who have

229
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
some really unique challenges and we're

230
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,840
actually building specialized programs

231
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,280
around their challenges but isn't it

232
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,039
more complicated for you because you've

233
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,639
got a lot of autonomy which

234
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,240
with each health district so they can

235
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,919
choose to let you in or

236
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,240
choose to hold you out so we have to

237
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,280
sell ourselves

238
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,160
all the time so the internal marketing

239
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,599
program is just as important as the

240
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,639
delivery of what you're trying to

241
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,800
achieve so not only do we have to create

242
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,199
like a really cool and interesting

243
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,039
program that people want to take notice

244
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,520
of

245
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,120
we also have to go out and create a

246
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,280
really cool awareness program and plan

247
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,560
that we can actually then go out and

248
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
sell to different areas and say hey look

249
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,520
this is all the cool stuff we've got to

250
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,559
offer

251
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,240
um it's in your best just bringing us on

252
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,399
board so lots of presentations okay so

253
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,760
what's been the fundamental difference

254
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,679
between you embark upon this journey

255
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,958
10 years ago to now and i'm not talking

256
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,240
about the quality of the

257
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,000
and the diversity of the content but

258
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,839
more upon the

259
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,600
the influence and the steps you've had

260
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,959
to take to get an

261
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,320
audience inside a very large beast of an

262
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,200
organization

263
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,959
we really had to sit down and work on an

264
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,959
operational plan that was probably

265
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,040
a good key element so we had to know

266
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,160
where we were going

267
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,519
and then we had to bring other people on

268
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,959
that journey with us we had to go and

269
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,519
talk to executives and board members

270
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,519
and talk to them about why this was so

271
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,880
important to them and why it's so

272
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,320
important to their staff

273
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,399
to to go on this journey so you actually

274
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,000
had to convince them

275
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,200
this was their interest

276
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,680
and have you seen an accelerated change

277
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,120
in their adoption or acceptance what

278
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,080
you're saying

279
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,800
between now and 10 years and you might

280
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,120
say

281
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,680
yes but can you share that the first

282
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,720
three years

283
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,959
this was a key point that we moved on

284
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,120
yeah the first three years was really

285
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,720
just going out and doing really ad hoc

286
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
presentations so and some of you may be

287
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,120
there

288
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
at the moment so if you're trying to put

289
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,160
a program together you might be going

290
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,279
out just talking to

291
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,760
whoever is willing to listen to you um i

292
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,279
know i've done many presentations where

293
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,040
i've sat in a room with just one or two

294
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,240
people

295
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,560
and then i was like this isn't working

296
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,519
we need to try and

297
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,480
and get more people involved and then we

298
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,200
started

299
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,959
talking to our line managers and doing

300
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,880
presentations for our line managers

301
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,399
because when they saw value in what we

302
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,760
were teaching then they would actually

303
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,000
go

304
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,519
back and encourage that their staff to

305
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,360
come along because none of our stuff in

306
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,279
this respect is mandatory it's a choice

307
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,399
whether they come

308
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,399
so we have to sell this it's really

309
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,240
interesting you you targeted the line

310
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,519
managers because i see one of the

311
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,440
fundamental faults in many organizations

312
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,839
they get the executive and the portal

313
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,959
and then you get the focusing on the

314
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,320
ground zero but the line managers get

315
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,240
left out and if you don't embrace or

316
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,160
suggest all levels of the organization

317
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,760
you're never going to grow and achieve

318
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,600
as much as you want

319
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,120
what was really interesting for me as a

320
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,279
burnout cop well no i'm about outcome

321
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,320
now what was interesting

322
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,079
when i was a cop was the most

323
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,440
influential people as a detective

324
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,959
superintendent and operational commander

325
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,399
fraud and cybercrime i could

326
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,399
you would think have someone authority

327
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,000
to direct certain actions and

328
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,600
certain things to be done but i found it

329
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,440
was the senior constables and the

330
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,160
sergeants

331
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,480
at the lower that line manager position

332
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,360
that were them

333
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
absolutely far more influential than i

334
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,720
was absolutely because they're in

335
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,240
control of my people's daily work so

336
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,279
they make the decisions

337
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,200
on what people do and don't do during

338
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,040
the day so obviously they're taking

339
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,399
direction from their executive

340
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,000
scene management why it's so important

341
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,519
to get out there engage with our boards

342
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,959
and our leadership teams

343
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,160
but then again to have those um meetings

344
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,839
and those presentations with the exec

345
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,600
with the senior leadership team so they

346
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
can actually go back and say look this

347
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
is actually a value

348
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,760
what they're teaching is going to

349
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,120
protect the information in our care and

350
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,240
it's going to make our lives a little

351
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,279
easier as well

352
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,640
and that's a key message that we always

353
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,959
try and push so you find yourself

354
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,200
stalking sorry wrongly doing

355
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,640
intelligence research

356
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,480
on the target audience particular

357
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,560
hospital particular location

358
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,320
find out who's who in the zoo what their

359
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,000
nuances are preferences

360
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,360
doing some sort of intelligence

361
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,920
background work before you go in and say

362
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,839
hey i'm tracy and i'm amazing and i've

363
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,600
got this i've got a story for you

364
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,680
yeah absolutely um we've had some cool

365
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
so you just admitted to everyone that

366
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,839
you stalk people across queensland

367
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,880
absolutely it's my favorite thing to do

368
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,760
no no you know i definitely do that yes

369
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,240
um

370
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,279
we've actually had some cool

371
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,480
opportunities where we've actually got

372
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,519
to go and do

373
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,680
physical security audits of different

374
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,880
facilities as well

375
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,959
that's been fantastic to actually learn

376
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,000
about

377
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,240
um the actual issues that are occurring

378
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,519
within different um

379
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,120
hospital health services so we can go

380
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,480
through and see how far we can get into

381
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,079
different places what information we can

382
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,120
find

383
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,399
and then being able to take that

384
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,920
information back and say look this is

385
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,040
actually what's going on in your

386
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,480
facilities and this is how we can create

387
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,160
a talent program to suit

388
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,399
you know i said uh i was at uh i think

389
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,440
was on the the

390
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,760
virtual event last year and this young

391
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,480
man got up

392
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,440
and i i'll claim the fact i'm getting

393
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,920
old

394
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,360
i don't remember his name but he made a

395
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,079
very poignant pitch and was all about

396
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,519
for an organization do you want

397
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,120
compliance to be

398
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,560
your floor or your ceiling and too often

399
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,480
in organizations i see they've got an

400
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,320
online training module they must do once

401
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,200
a year

402
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
it ticks the compliance box in terms of

403
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
being making a meaningful difference

404
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,440
zero and i've gone into those

405
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,880
organizations and you actually have

406
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,240
questioned and they're

407
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,240
interviewed people about their ability

408
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,680
to recall and understand and know what

409
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,399
they should do

410
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,639
and it's virtually zero and i say to

411
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,160
them looks and if that's all you've got

412
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,440
a mandatory online

413
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,800
training program you've got to head up

414
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,160
your clacker and you need to embrace

415
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,959
your people

416
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,639
because you might take a box but it's

417
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,240
making zero difference and what is it

418
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,519
you really want

419
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,040
so what do you think about an online

420
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
training yeah well

421
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,160
look he said i've been doing this for a

422
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
long time and i'm not saying always get

423
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,200
it right so our very first training

424
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,440
module was about 40 minutes

425
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,120
and i can i can talk about it because i

426
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
created it and um it was

427
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,639
compliance-based and i crammed

428
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,480
everything i thought they had to know

429
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,160
into this 40 minute training session

430
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,360
about 20

431
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,800
very difficult questions because i

432
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,399
wanted them to know everything they

433
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,920
needed to know and come away from it

434
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,199
how do you think that went down not so

435
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,720
good we've got a lot of unhappy staff

436
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,160
going i don't want to do this but i have

437
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,839
to do this for a while

438
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,399
so um we go okay we need to change what

439
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,600
we're doing

440
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,360
and as you saw from the beginning of

441
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
this session i like to do things that

442
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,320
are fun

443
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,920
so we went out and did a whole lot of

444
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,839
research and i came across has anyone

445
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,839
out there seen the airbus cyber security

446
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,160
videos before

447
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,959
yeah some have they are fun and i kept

448
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:09,600
watching them

449
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,519
over and over and over again to the

450
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,120
point where if i'm

451
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,639
willing to sit here and just watch this

452
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,680
over and over again because they have

453
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,519
fun it's all if you haven't seen them

454
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,079
they are um really cool little scenarios

455
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,040
there's no talking

456
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,560
it's just actions and music and

457
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,399
explaining different cyber security um

458
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,519
issues

459
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,279
so i thought let's let's create some of

460
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,920
these of our own um so we created like

461
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,440
five fun little videos

462
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,399
um they have fun i did some research

463
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,839
when you're fun

464
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,320
uh luke do you mind sharing that fun

465
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,079
video please

466
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,440
and then just for the record this is

467
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,839
tracy thank you

468
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,599
delicious

469
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,639
yeah it might look like it comes from

470
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,120
your bank your phone company

471
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,399
the tax office or even australian post

472
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,240
these emails have a sense of urgency

473
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,639
about them and there's always links

474
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,519
that you need to click on but don't be

475
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,399
filmed

476
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,399
clicking on the links or downloading the

477
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,759
files can put

478
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,880
malware on your computer and now it can

479
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,199
do

480
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,360
lots of nasty things when you print all

481
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,040
the information and demand

482
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,000
some payment to get it but you can

483
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
easily avoid this happening by knowing

484
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,480
how to

485
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,759
recognize it okay okay so we didn't

486
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,839
actually distribute those but

487
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,600
we did they're not our mentor training

488
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,759
videos but we do like to try different

489
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,279
things all the time and some things are

490
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,040
going to work really really well

491
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,079
so a key takeaway here is that be

492
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,839
willing to try anything

493
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,920
so and it's a bit scary especially if

494
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,440
you're working in like

495
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,399
an area as large as what i do to step

496
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,320
outside that box and step outside that

497
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,360
compliance box

498
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,600
but this stuff works we actually did

499
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,199
those and we um

500
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,880
trialed them with our team and we got

501
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,959
some mixed mixed results on them

502
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,880
but we were still investigating actually

503
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,480
using that was just doing snapchat

504
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,120
filter

505
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,480
because i think that when you're doing

506
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,160
any kind of awareness program you really

507
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,600
need to look at especially

508
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,959
like when we're trying to reach a

509
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,680
hundred thousand people whose ages in

510
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
our organization range from

511
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,560
you know 17 to you know

512
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,160
we've got some people in our 70s still

513
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,600
working with us so

514
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,279
we need to try and reach all those

515
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,880
different audience using so many

516
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,360
different

517
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,959
so what you actually did you created

518
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,480
something and you experimented with it

519
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:44,959
and it

520
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,880
by your own admission it didn't quite

521
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,240
hit the mark well

522
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,680
yeah we haven't fully gone out with that

523
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,880
one yet we want to investigate what do

524
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,839
you guys think did you like it

525
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,600
brody brady's in my team over he's like

526
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,040
going night because he's techy and he's

527
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,480
like no i'm not kidding

528
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,920
so maybe your focus group was wrong you

529
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,120
should have shown it up in the weeper

530
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
team or something yeah absolutely

531
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,400
but i think the essence of that you got

532
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,880
to keep trialing and everything we're in

533
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,400
a constant i would suggest

534
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,280
a position of evolving and uh as we

535
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,039
evolve we accept different nuances

536
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,000
challenges and

537
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,439
we become more tolerant certain things

538
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,199
or we get to realize

539
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,799
the light bulb goes off and say hey this

540
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,640
is really important

541
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,839
and so what doesn't work today

542
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,839
may well work tomorrow yeah exactly

543
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,880
right

544
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,799
and you've got to be willing to move

545
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,919
with um

546
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,520
we know that everything we do every day

547
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,280
is changing in this field right

548
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,960
no day's ever the same anyone who works

549
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,320
in cyber security knows every day you

550
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,960
come into work

551
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,240
there is some new challenge that you

552
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,320
have to face um and our awareness

553
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,960
materials

554
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,720
and our programs have to move at that

555
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,880
same pace and that can be a challenge in

556
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,600
itself

557
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
so that's why it's great to have your

558
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,120
baseline training but to be able to

559
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,240
to mix it up with all these

560
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,600
communication messages and you've seen

561
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,880
some really cool stuff hopefully

562
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,000
flipping around the back

563
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
that um we've done internally through

564
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,240
our my amazing graphics person

565
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,960
one of the big challenges me when i uh

566
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,720
when i looked around was that there was

567
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,679
a there was

568
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,600
ample material out there that getting

569
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,880
those fundamentals should we say

570
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,120
and people were forced to do it and they

571
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,720
did it once a year we know their

572
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,679
attention was

573
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,799
switched off all and one of the issues

574
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,799
you're talking to people was they didn't

575
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,320
understand why it was necessary because

576
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,960
they didn't

577
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,720
see themselves touching the cyber

578
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,120
environment

579
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,520
it's the issue of why it's so important

580
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,160
come up

581
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,240
why is essential i think that was one of

582
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,080
the key things that changed

583
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,200
um our program moving forward so before

584
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,400
we were out there doing our

585
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,919
presentations on

586
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,120
you know what do you need to know here's

587
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,960
the policy here's the process this is

588
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
the the key risks that are in clean sun

589
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,440
health

590
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,880
and then we changed it and we actually

591
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,919
moved to why is it important to you

592
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,080
why is it important to your family what

593
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,280
can you do

594
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,799
and what can you do with these

595
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,559
particular very simple principles

596
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,080
because they are very simple principles

597
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,559
that we are sharing with our staff to

598
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,919
protect yourselves and the things that

599
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:00,960
matter to you most

600
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,559
because i'm a really strong believer and

601
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,240
if we train people up on how to protect

602
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,120
themselves at home

603
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,280
protect the families protect the things

604
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,480
that matter to them they're going to

605
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,520
bring those

606
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,960
those techniques and tools into

607
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,280
queensland yeah because organizations if

608
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,160
it might be important to the

609
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,480
organization but it's not important to

610
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,200
the people it makes no difference and

611
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,480
those fundamentals that you just

612
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,120
mentioned is

613
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,000
make it personal make it relevant and

614
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,440
then you've got a chance of becoming

615
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,640
important and then they may

616
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,280
pull down those in your case not so

617
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,720
boring online learning modules to

618
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,440
actually

619
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,799
need to know about this yeah 100 um

620
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,799
another thing there with that is that

621
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,400
that's where your culture shift comes in

622
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,440
so when we're talking about awareness

623
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,039
versus culture

624
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,400
that's where that shift will start to

625
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,080
happen with us where they will

626
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,200
will start doing these things

627
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
automatically and their culture about

628
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,919
how they re

629
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,000
even respond to cyber incidents will

630
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,880
change right now how do you you've got a

631
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,120
small team you've got a massive

632
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,679
uh disparate organization over a massive

633
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,799
state

634
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,160
different sizes priorities and

635
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,080
everything else how are you

636
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,240
addressing trying to replicate what you

637
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,720
do across the state okay so

638
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,240
this is actually what i'm really excited

639
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,760
about and really passionate about

640
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,240
um so we've launched a cyber ambassador

641
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,039
program

642
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,880
um our ambassador program this is

643
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,640
something gosh that

644
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,480
kim and i went to a sans conference

645
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,960
probably about how long ago was that

646
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,640
10 years ago probably right when i

647
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,080
started my career i was like i want to

648
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,679
do this so ambassador program is all

649
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,440
about getting people on board

650
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,000
to help share our messaging so we

651
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,559
actually

652
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,080
have launched our first ambassador

653
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,640
program last year so we've got

654
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,840
about four different hospital health

655
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,440
services involved in this program and we

656
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,280
have about 14 staff

657
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,880
that have come on board and there are a

658
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,320
range of staff we've got some people

659
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,840
that have a communications background

660
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,600
some people that are actual trainers

661
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,320
we have some nurse educators people work

662
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,039
with the

663
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,280
graduate students coming in so we put

664
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,480
them through a three-day

665
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,080
workshop now this was supposed to be

666
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,159
face to face covert then hit and

667
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,760
everything went pear shaped so we did it

668
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,559
virtually

669
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,760
which i was a little concerned about but

670
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
it actually went really well so

671
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,440
what we do they actually we trained them

672
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,200
up in all of our key messaging what we

673
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,880
wanted them to know

674
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,159
and talk to them all about cyber

675
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,240
security and then they've actually gone

676
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,600
out and started to

677
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,000
deliver our messages for us which that

678
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,600
is the essential thing because

679
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,520
i have myself i have another staff

680
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,120
member working with my with full-time at

681
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,159
the moment

682
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,400
we cannot reach 100 000 people

683
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
at you know that in that really timely

684
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,640
manner that needs to be reached

685
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,240
and one of the most exciting things that

686
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,280
i have actually come out of the

687
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,559
ambassador program

688
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,200
was we have a nurse educator and uh she

689
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,679
had been quite quiet through the program

690
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,760
and then all of a sudden she's gone back

691
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,720
into her work

692
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,440
and she's just she's run about 130

693
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,000
sessions for

694
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,240
me since we launched it that's huge and

695
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,760
also our clinical stuff

696
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,919
which again is huge so it's a cohort we

697
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,280
really struggle to get

698
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,880
traction with because they are busy

699
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,080
obviously because they're on the wards

700
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,880
looking after

701
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,640
patients they're doing their job so is

702
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,000
this an addition to their normal

703
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,360
duties this is an addition to their

704
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,720
normal genius they don't get paid for

705
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,039
this

706
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,960
they have volunteered because it's

707
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,080
something that they have shown an

708
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,120
interest in

709
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,440
so it's great for them to develop their

710
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,799
careers if they're looking at

711
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,640
doing more work in the awareness field

712
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,000
or if they just want a little change

713
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,120
to what they're doing um so yeah um emma

714
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,400
went out to her name's emma she's

715
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
fantastic

716
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,280
and she actually emailed me and said hey

717
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,799
tracy i've just had the best win

718
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,120
today and i was like what's that she

719
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,960
said went out and i did a training

720
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,000
session with

721
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,159
some nursing staff and i just got an

722
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,080
email back from the nurse unit manager

723
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,880
who said

724
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,159
we've just stopped a ransom we're

725
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,679
attacking potential ransomware attack on

726
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,799
our hospital

727
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,799
because of the that really timely

728
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,000
session they had

729
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,120
one of their vendors had been

730
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,360
compromised and they had actually gone

731
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,720
through and sent an email back to this

732
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,280
nursing

733
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,200
manager and she was about to click on

734
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,960
the link and open it up

735
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,600
when she went oh some of the things emma

736
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,480
told me

737
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,960
uh they were in this email and so she

738
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,240
stopped

739
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,960
and she got that email assessed and it

740
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,640
was a ransomware email

741
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,080
so and which could have had a massive

742
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,240
impact and then um she got an email from

743
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,840
two other staff members in that team who

744
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,440
had also attended that presentation that

745
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,840
got

746
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,960
the same email and yeah so that for me

747
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,159
is the whole core of of why i do what i

748
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,559
do and why the ambassador program or

749
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,400
something like that if you can implement

750
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,559
something like that in your organization

751
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,320
it's phenomenal we're about to run our

752
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,640
second one in at the end of july

753
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,280
and we've got people from all over not

754
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,880
only different hospital health services

755
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,760
getting involved

756
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,520
we also have people from our service

757
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,039
desk getting involved as well so it's

758
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,480
really exciting so i think you said you

759
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,520
started out with four

760
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,640
hospitals yes have you found that the

761
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,799
the word or the positive messages have

762
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,919
started emanate and

763
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,360
now others want to jump on board

764
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,520
absolutely and some of those key stories

765
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,039
like we're getting from people on the

766
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,480
ground who are now out there delivering

767
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,080
training on our behalf which is

768
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,279
amazing um those stories are going

769
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,400
through our different boards and

770
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,520
executive meetings

771
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,960
they've heard about it and now they're

772
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,400
jumping on board and they said we want

773
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,000
to be part of this program

774
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,679
and they're really willing to support

775
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,039
their staff taking time

776
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,520
out of their work to come and get these

777
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,279
messages across to their staff

778
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,799
i mean do you think the uh i mean

779
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,880
since commencement of covert we know the

780
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,400
attacks upon the healthcare sector have

781
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,000
increased 200

782
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,720
is there a greater deal more awareness

783
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,320
and that we've had some

784
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,400
very recent issues in health in this

785
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,440
state

786
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,520
is that actually bringing more

787
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,200
opportunities for you or more work

788
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,120
don't they go hand in hand well i'm not

789
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,240
i'm asking you are they mutually

790
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,039
exclusive or

791
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,679
no i think they go hand in hand so the

792
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:34,080
um

793
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,760
i have actually seen in the last six

794
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,840
months probably actually since covert

795
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,360
hit um the the want for people to get

796
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,039
cyber awareness is actually increased

797
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,000
tenfold

798
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,760
um it's also had to flip the way we

799
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,039
deliver our work as well

800
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,799
because we've been very much face to

801
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,120
face doing um virtual i don't know if

802
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,720
there's any trainers in the room today

803
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,640
but before covert here and before we all

804
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,240
started working remotely

805
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
i used to really hate delivering

806
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,520
training via

807
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,159
video conference and considering that

808
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,919
you know i have to teach people from

809
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,720
torres strait

810
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,279
to you know um texas down the you know

811
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,360
bottom of our state

812
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
and i live in mirabara so i don't even

813
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,279
live in brisbane with the rest of my

814
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,200
team that was a challenge

815
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
but i've actually found that um yeah

816
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,480
we've had to flip around and

817
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,200
how did you see mirabara then did i say

818
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,440
maribora

819
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
that's all right but i mean you make it

820
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,559
happen right i mean

821
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,320
you just you stand up and you make it

822
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,919
happen yes and then the essence of what

823
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,799
you're doing is you're making a

824
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,360
difference

825
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,600
yes and i said yeah people have have

826
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,960
really embraced cyber awareness at the

827
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,640
moment they recognize the importance of

828
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,120
it

829
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,720
so when you reflect back upon this

830
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,320
10-year journey

831
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
and obviously there's many 10 years

832
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,720
periods to come

833
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,480
what have been the greatest dare i say

834
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,760
pitfalls or challenges

835
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
so okay let's go with challenges first

836
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,960
and i want to come back to pitfalls and

837
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,240
mistakes or

838
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,840
the lessons you would share with the

839
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,679
audience so to help them

840
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,159
take some things on board challenges are

841
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,480
besides working with some of your fellow

842
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,799
stuff

843
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,200
no no they're fantastic um some of the

844
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,080
challenges i think

845
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,480
are obviously we all face financial

846
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,279
challenges

847
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,640
so especially working in healthcare

848
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,320
environment where do people want to

849
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,120
spend money

850
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,799
that's on health care that's on the on

851
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,320
getting services to our

852
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,760
on that point right you're in the

853
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,159
business of saving lives so

854
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,000
you know yes health care is and i've

855
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,600
heard it before that you know we can't

856
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,279
afford to waste money on cyber security

857
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,440
we've got to save lives but what's

858
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,720
really interesting is the

859
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,480
you know the iomt the internet of

860
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,600
medical things

861
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,360
that's diversity it's so inextricably

862
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,880
interwoven do you think the

863
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,520
the environment realizes now it touches

864
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,120
digital footprint touches everywhere

865
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,480
everywhere i think they're getting more

866
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,760
aware of that and that's through the

867
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
work that we've been doing to educate

868
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,400
at all levels but yeah we do have that

869
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,520
challenge of

870
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,400
of just reaching all the people that we

871
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,039
need to

872
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,440
reach in that really timely manner that

873
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,039
is a huge challenge for us like i said

874
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,480
anyone who's got to deal with

875
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,480
having to educate over 100 000 people um

876
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,159
and talk about all the different things

877
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,679
that are relevant to them so

878
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,720
obviously when we're talking with

879
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
operational services staff

880
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,880
we have different challenges for them as

881
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,240
to when we're talking to

882
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,159
our medical staff as to when we're

883
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,640
talking to our administration finance

884
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,039
team

885
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,320
so there are so many different programs

886
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,039
that we need to run

887
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,399
and that's a challenge when we have just

888
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,399
a very small team to do that

889
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,240
do you feel you're making progress at

890
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,080
the right pace

891
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,600
oh sometimes no actually i don't always

892
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,440
think we are but i don't think

893
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,120
i think any passion a person here would

894
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
admit they're never satisfied

895
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,559
i never think i'm doing the best job

896
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,799
that i can do and maybe that's why i

897
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,039
keep pushing to do more because i never

898
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,559
think that i'm meeting the challenge as

899
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,760
well as we could be meeting the

900
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,720
challenge

901
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,840
um and that again is because of the um

902
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,360
resources that we have to do that on the

903
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,640
subject of challenges

904
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,840
and i want to ask you a sensitive

905
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
question i'm not trying to embarrass you

906
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,399
or

907
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,399
any other technical people but

908
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,520
have you found the technical audience

909
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,240
have sometimes been a difficult part of

910
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,520
the group to get on board with the

911
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,440
program yeah absolutely

912
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,679
um but again that could be coming from

913
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,679
myself not being technical as well

914
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,080
so where i need to move in that space is

915
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,559
to get on board people within my team

916
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,640
who i can kind of encourage to get out

917
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,840
and talk to them as well

918
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
so we're starting to run tech talks and

919
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,360
things like that from

920
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,360
our subject matter experts within our

921
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,200
team um and we're actually starting to

922
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,720
deliver some really cool presentations

923
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,000
around the state around that more

924
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,919
technical side of things to get them on

925
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,360
board and get them educated

926
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,799
so they understand what you're working

927
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,399
100 and then

928
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,720
uh and then obviously they can then take

929
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,520
that information

930
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520
and then and put that around and help to

931
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,279
get messages out to their staff as well

932
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,960
and if there are any other barriers or

933
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,520
groups besides a tyranny of distance

934
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,360
budget resourcing um

935
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,000
subcultural differences the uh it's not

936
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,919
a focus we're here to save lives

937
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,200
i think we've done pretty well so far

938
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
any other major challenges you'd want to

939
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,520
share at the moment because then

940
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,360
pitfalls is coming up

941
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,600
mistakes mistakes yeah we just go to

942
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,679
mistakes because

943
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,640
no mistakes um i never like to think

944
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,000
i've actually made a mistake

945
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,679
i think everything we do is a learning

946
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,919
opportunity to move forward so

947
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,760
do i look at my very first e-learning

948
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,320
program and go oh maybe that was not the

949
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,000
best one i've ever done

950
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,840
but it was a learning opportunity out of

951
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,039
that came

952
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,200
what um when when staff actually take

953
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,240
the time out of the day

954
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,279
to contact me and go hey just finished

955
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,480
our ministry training

956
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,919
and you know it's the best thing i've

957
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,480
done it's fun i i learn a lot from it

958
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,600
i can see the importance of what you're

959
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,200
doing but i had a good time doing it can

960
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,640
all mental training be delivered in this

961
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,840
way

962
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,600
then i'm going you know what whatever i

963
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,039
did wrong in the first place that was a

964
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,440
learning point to get me where i am now

965
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
and i think one of the key things is

966
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,600
don't be afraid to try something

967
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,679
different to step outside that box

968
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,399
well i'd almost argue wouldn't you

969
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,320
you're required to step outside the box

970
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,520
and you're required

971
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,760
to do things differently don't you have

972
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,279
to constantly evolve i mean how

973
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:09,919
important

974
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,320
is diversity and variety in this space

975
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,840
it's incredibly important but for anyone

976
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,440
who works in a government organization

977
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,120
especially one as old as the one i work

978
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,600
in

979
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,039
it can be hard to to challenge what

980
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,080
needs to be done so it does take courage

981
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,840
i think to go i'm going to try something

982
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,279
a little bit different today and i'm

983
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,799
going to see how far i can get with it

984
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,880
i've thrown some ideas out there that

985
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,200
really felt quite flat so

986
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,320
but you've got to put it out there to

987
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,399
see how it will float and like we said

988
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,600
right at the beginning it may not work

989
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,120
today but it may absolutely work

990
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,600
tomorrow

991
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,919
absolutely exactly because like i said

992
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,559
um the attitudes change

993
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,840
even within our organization the more

994
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,120
comfortable they get with the messages

995
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,159
that we're putting out

996
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,679
the more they're willing to accept from

997
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,600
us so yeah it

998
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,960
our job is going to be here for a very

999
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,320
long time okay so let's get back to the

1000
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,279
variety of

1001
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,840
uh you've got core messages there are

1002
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,440
new messages emerging from what the

1003
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,880
crooks are doing and the way they uh

1004
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,399
change their methodologies and points

1005
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,120
for taking

1006
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,399
and the different technologies that

1007
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,480
emerge

1008
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
you started out with the core

1009
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,080
fundamental 40-minute

1010
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
stab me in the eye online training

1011
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,399
process

1012
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,559
well it's interesting now most of them

1013
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,360
are shorter and sharper aren't they yeah

1014
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,120
like a minute but you can't i know

1015
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,600
organizations repeating the same

1016
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,720
module five years in a row

1017
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,760
yes so how important is to change that

1018
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,720
learning module

1019
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,120
and the delivery process on a regular

1020
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,760
basis

1021
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,880
yeah and that's really important and

1022
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,159
that's the thing we developed this

1023
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,840
program we invested quite a lot of money

1024
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,559
in it

1025
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,960
um and it's been uh out about two years

1026
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,240
now and they're already looking

1027
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,919
so the organization's already come back

1028
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,080
saying can you guys this is great

1029
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,760
what's next what are you guys going to

1030
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,440
do next so

1031
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,279
we're ready to move forward and come up

1032
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,720
with something new as well one of the

1033
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,159
issues that's come up recently is

1034
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,200
gamification

1035
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,640
i love gamification you love gaming yes

1036
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,480
it's much fun how's it going over with

1037
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,760
the with the organization

1038
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,840
so we've uh we've brought this cool um

1039
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,600
like physical cyber security games this

1040
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,640
is brand new for us

1041
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,960
into service into queensland health um

1042
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,480
the fun thing about that was

1043
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,399
actually when i first did it to be

1044
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,679
perfectly honest i'm like i don't know

1045
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,279
how this is going to go down with people

1046
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,159
because it was

1047
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,399
there's no no no technology involved

1048
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,919
really there's only one station where

1049
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,039
people actually have to try and hack

1050
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,799
into someone's social media account

1051
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,080
other than that it is physical hands-on

1052
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,880
card kind of playing games and but you

1053
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,519
know what

1054
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,080
the staff have loved it they've had so

1055
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,200
much fun with it

1056
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,880
um and i actually recently just did this

1057
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,640
session with a group of

1058
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,880
tech people and that was really scary

1059
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,640
i'm like they're not going to like this

1060
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,480
because it's the basics of cyber and

1061
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,440
it's games my gosh did they have the

1062
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,960
best time of their life and they loved

1063
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,080
it and then they've been saying other

1064
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,960
people to come along

1065
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,240
are you guilty of profiling people

1066
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,760
yes because sometimes they scare me

1067
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,240
because they're so smart and

1068
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,919
absolutely i get really nervous talking

1069
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,760
to people so but i also hold them in

1070
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,200
such a high regard

1071
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
and that i'm looking at they're the

1072
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,799
experts in this field and if they love

1073
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,159
this and they can embrace this and we're

1074
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,919
doing a good job as well

1075
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,840
yeah but even though the area is getting

1076
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,200
so specialized

1077
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,240
that you know it's like many of us who

1078
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,360
are so focused on

1079
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,320
um different aspects uh in policing for

1080
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,760
example for me it was financial

1081
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,880
cyber and identity crime um you know

1082
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,279
i had been in the drug squad 15 years

1083
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,240
earlier but

1084
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,159
i wasn't up to speed at all with the

1085
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,760
latest techniques of drug production

1086
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,720
distribution

1087
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,240
and the way they're embracing you know

1088
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,159
different parts of that process in

1089
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,519
australia but

1090
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,960
i'd imagine it's the same with with

1091
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,519
technology so yeah but you're i see you

1092
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,039
sitting in a position where you've got a

1093
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,720
more holistic view of the greater

1094
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,640
structure of the organization

1095
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,600
than someone just purely in a tech role

1096
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,279
yeah we can see it from the end user's

1097
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,320
point of view

1098
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,360
i think one of the the key things is as

1099
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,760
well

1100
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,080
if you're coming into cyber security

1101
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,880
team

1102
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,919
and you are not technical you have a

1103
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:00,559
really

1104
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,200
um specific skill set that you can bring

1105
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,880
so what you can do is that your skill

1106
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
set is that you can talk to the business

1107
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,239
which is key um so i always figure if i

1108
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,839
can talk to the tech guys and

1109
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,599
learn they can teach me what i need to

1110
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,839
know and then i can translate that

1111
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,480
out into the everyday speak of our

1112
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,159
employees and our staff

1113
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,159
then we're winning so if you are not a

1114
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,159
technical person and you're working in a

1115
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:24,879
tech team

1116
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,639
then embrace that because there is a

1117
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,440
particular reason why you're there

1118
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,199
and there's a very special reason why

1119
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,639
you're there

1120
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,079
so how do you know you're making a

1121
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,320
difference

1122
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,280
how do i know i'm making difference the

1123
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,599
fee

1124
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,000
i like i love instant feedback and i get

1125
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,839
a lot of that

1126
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,839
um i think we can see a difference

1127
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,280
because i can see a change in people's

1128
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,719
behaviors

1129
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,239
like we can see an increase in people

1130
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,760
actually reporting

1131
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,440
phishing emails we can see a

1132
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,119
higher engagement in the work that we're

1133
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,720
doing so instead of

1134
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,400
me going out and selling my wares all

1135
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,839
the time i have actually people coming

1136
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,440
to me and going hey tracy i've heard

1137
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,880
about this from xyz

1138
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,359
can you come in and do some work for us

1139
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,480
but i think it comes

1140
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,079
would it all know it's also not coming

1141
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,359
back to the point you've actually

1142
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,480
actually had to do a

1143
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,720
by the sound of things a damn lot of

1144
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,599
work on

1145
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,720
establishing communication pathways

1146
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,520
across the state across the business

1147
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,280
relationship buildings and

1148
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,440
yeah basically we do have our awareness

1149
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,119
plan which has all of our core elements

1150
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,560
and all our core activities that we want

1151
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,359
to deliver

1152
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,359
so we have all our set stuff and then we

1153
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,640
have to

1154
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,079
get that out to all the different areas

1155
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,079
across the state so how important is it

1156
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:36,640
to stop

1157
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,880
pause reflect to see what you've done

1158
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,000
everything and then

1159
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,760
celebrate that and share that with

1160
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,280
everyone

1161
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,560
and that's quite funny because we do

1162
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,320
have an operational plan that gives us

1163
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,160
three years worth of where we are now

1164
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,520
where we want to be

1165
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,119
um and when you get to the end of each

1166
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,720
year it's really important to stop and

1167
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,160
actually because you get so

1168
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,000
caught up in the work that you're doing

1169
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,040
and making sure you're getting your

1170
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,240
messaging out

1171
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,400
in that really timely consistent fashion

1172
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,760
to sit back and go wow

1173
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,880
this is all the stuff we've done this

1174
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,160
year but this is all the stuff we still

1175
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,040
have to do

1176
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,359
so having an operational plan is an

1177
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,040
absolute key thing and i'm not sure how

1178
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,560
many different areas actually have one

1179
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,800
of those in place

1180
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,119
yeah i see a lot of people um not

1181
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,960
putting in the sophisticated

1182
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,240
approach to strategy planning execution

1183
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,280
review monitor evaluate adjust

1184
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,200
because you know this is a crazy

1185
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,320
um diverse and constantly evolving

1186
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,280
environment that

1187
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,680
where change is the norm and the the

1188
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,880
speed of change is

1189
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,520
um quite extraordinary yes so that's a

1190
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,280
challenge for you and

1191
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,720
is there anything you would like to do

1192
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,200
in the next three years to

1193
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,240
take it even more forward and accelerate

1194
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,480
the process what you're trying to do

1195
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,760
i'd like a bigger channel don't say more

1196
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,400
money more team more resources

1197
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,560
no expanding that ambassador program is

1198
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,240
key i think to getting our messaging out

1199
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,320
there in a consistent manner

1200
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,599
i also really want to start moving into

1201
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,160
looking at educating so the kids in the

1202
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,920
children's hospital looking at educate

1203
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,359
and cyber awareness

1204
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,720
and actually educating um our patients

1205
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,359
on how to

1206
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,680
to interact with their healthcare data

1207
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,200
in a more secure manner so actually

1208
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,320
extending outside of

1209
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,400
as well our core business and looking at

1210
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,760
that makes good sense because i think

1211
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,560
you've got the

1212
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,400
i'm going to call it the queensland

1213
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
health 2026 digital transformation

1214
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,359
strategy

1215
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,599
which in the future looks to how people

1216
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,520
can make their own appointments at home

1217
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,880
they can get some treatments

1218
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,040
telehealth if something's accelerated

1219
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,000
since covid

1220
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,400
yes and so you're looking at how you

1221
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,240
extend your awareness program out into

1222
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,599
the community absolutely

1223
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,800
because it's inevitable the organization

1224
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,079
queensland health will be

1225
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,839
you know used as in phishing attacks

1226
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,760
against those people absolutely and just

1227
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,280
moving out and educating those people

1228
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,640
and how to look after themselves

1229
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,240
how look after those devices that maybe

1230
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,680
attach the person

1231
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,119
and how to interact with their own

1232
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,480
health information to keep that safe and

1233
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,200
secure

1234
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,240
because we know that the value

1235
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,720
information is in data right so

1236
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,680
so do you feel you're making a

1237
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,560
difference yeah actually i do

1238
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,119
i do um i have my days where it's a bit

1239
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,720
of a struggle but on the whole i think

1240
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,839
i'm really proud of

1241
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,160
the the work my team has done i think

1242
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,480
that they have come up with and i i said

1243
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:14,720
i

1244
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,240
hope you can have a good look at the

1245
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,200
information that's flipping around

1246
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,240
behind us but

1247
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,000
they've come up with some amazing

1248
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,920
campaigns and all of our campaigns

1249
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,480
are personal so we've moved away from

1250
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,240
the locks we've moved away from the guys

1251
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,040
and the hoodies

1252
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,040
we've moved away from those really

1253
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,880
generic cyber security messaging

1254
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,160
and we're trying to come up with some

1255
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,680
really creative and unique ways to

1256
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,800
engage people

1257
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,760
if i can make one person stop in the

1258
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,400
lift

1259
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
and look at our information and get

1260
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,440
something out of it

1261
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,920
that's an absolute win to me now when

1262
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,520
you're trying to win over the regions of

1263
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,240
the district

1264
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,280
hospitals did you how important was it

1265
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,920
to

1266
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,760
review their strategic and operational

1267
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,599
imperatives and align what you're doing

1268
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,880
to try and convince them

1269
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,400
we have to do that but you're working

1270
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,160
for them yeah that's exactly we have to

1271
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,000
do that i have to make everything we do

1272
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,520
align with our hospital and health

1273
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,119
services deliverables and our

1274
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,480
organization symbols and queensland

1275
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,920
health levels there's a whole lot of

1276
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,440
different plans that have to go into

1277
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:07,839
making

1278
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,240
our work relevant and relatable to what

1279
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,520
they're trying to achieve especially in

1280
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,280
this digital space

1281
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,440
right do you think um sometimes that's a

1282
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,200
mistake that might get made by people

1283
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,040
so if you if you actually said to the

1284
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,480
audience

1285
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,240
one or two things that they should take

1286
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,520
away from today

1287
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,480
as we wind up as fancy pants here is

1288
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,240
gonna telling us it's time to go

1289
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,720
yep so be don't be afraid to step

1290
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,680
outside the box

1291
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,520
if you're running an awareness program

1292
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,280
don't be afraid to try something that is

1293
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,000
different

1294
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,400
that is an absolute key um and

1295
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,280
definitely

1296
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,880
start working with your executive

1297
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
leadership teams your senior leadership

1298
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,520
teams

1299
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,400
and creating some really cool messaging

1300
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,680
that might get out there and cut through

1301
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,800
all that noise

1302
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,400
tracy weeks queensland health thank you

1303
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,000
very much for sharing your insights it's

1304
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,720
been brilliant

1305
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,200
thank you

1306
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,480
thank you brian tracy uh

1307
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,400
thank you we're pretty much out of time

1308
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,079
but um there are a couple of questions

1309
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,319
people uh would like to ask uh if tracy

1310
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,520
can take a second oh

1311
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,920
sorry i'm not going for you just uh just

1312
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,640
a couple

1313
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,760
um well there's actually a whole heap

1314
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,040
but i'm just gonna pick a couple here

1315
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,920
which are quite

1316
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,119
interesting um so uh where

1317
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,440
was i was there so many i had to have a

1318
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,800
look oh yeah um so

1319
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,040
the one of the earlier ones and uh um

1320
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,480
one of the more challenging ones it

1321
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,920
seems to be that um

1322
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,200
the program's really kicked off and

1323
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,400
working quite well now and you've

1324
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,599
actually got people coming forward and

1325
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,280
actively volunteering as ambassadors

1326
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,720
but how have you been getting people to

1327
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,560
volunteer as ambassadors yeah so we've

1328
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,400
actually had to engage with

1329
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,040
the management teams and say do you have

1330
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,800
some people in mind that would be

1331
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,480
you know interested in this program or

1332
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,520
they're actually people that i've

1333
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,800
interacted with when i've gone around

1334
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,079
the state delivering face-to-face

1335
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,680
training that i've met personally i'm

1336
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,599
gone you'd be a great person

1337
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,560
to get involved so moving forward though

1338
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,480
we're looking at making that more of a

1339
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,760
expression of interest and actually

1340
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,200
putting it out there and and getting

1341
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
people from all different facets of the

1342
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,800
organization to get involved

1343
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,400
we've actually got a director of allied

1344
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,839
health that's involved in our ambassador

1345
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:06,960
program

1346
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,960
and they use we use that person they can

1347
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,079
actually distribute messages through

1348
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,599
their meetings and things like that so

1349
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,560
that it's a really cool

1350
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,160
touch point that we would normally not

1351
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
have had access to so you've basically

1352
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,599
been tapping people on the shoulder and

1353
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,119
directly engaging people who you thought

1354
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,400
were going to be a really good fit and

1355
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,400
actually fantastic okay that's

1356
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,440
interesting to see

1357
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,880
um so somebody's actually uh going it's

1358
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,240
they think it's great making the

1359
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
messaging really engaging

1360
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,160
but um do you think making light of it

1361
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,839
downplays it's importance and people

1362
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,440
miss some of the criticality

1363
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,200
yeah you know what initially i thought

1364
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,480
that could be a challenge

1365
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,079
but the feedback that's actually coming

1366
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,920
back from our employees when they're

1367
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,760
actually looking at this information has

1368
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,040
been the most positive stuff so we

1369
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,640
actually get emails

1370
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,800
from people like our nursing people

1371
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,000
clinical staff

1372
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,280
who've actually just taken the time out

1373
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,440
of the day to go just saw your poster on

1374
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,040
this just saw your um

1375
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,440
little video on on phishing or usb

1376
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,040
security whatever it might be

1377
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,760
and i loved it so i actually think that

1378
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,160
it's

1379
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,599
working and i don't think it's down

1380
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,200
playing and they've actually made a

1381
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,000
statement

1382
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,880
where they said i understand the

1383
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,680
importance of what you are selling to me

1384
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,000
but i really appreciate it being done in

1385
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,359
an engaging way

1386
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,720
so that's actual feedback has come

1387
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,720
through fantastic yeah

1388
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,800
um and the last one i'll ask of this

1389
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,160
list is i'm given the

1390
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,200
um the team you manage and its broad

1391
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,839
remit how do you strike that balance of

1392
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,520
being both friend and foe given you've

1393
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,599
got both audit responsibilities as well

1394
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,440
as this training and outreach

1395
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,160
capability i do believe that selling so

1396
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,160
we are selling a serious message

1397
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,000
um and sometimes it can be a scary

1398
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,280
message as well

1399
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,880
so when i'm going out there and i'm

1400
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,560
selling it it's more about

1401
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,920
how why is this so important to you so

1402
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,000
why is protecting queensland health

1403
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,119
information important

1404
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,760
to you um it's not about the technology

1405
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,520
it's not about that what can you do

1406
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,839
so i think making it personable and

1407
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,520
let's face it i'm not an overly scary

1408
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,240
person

1409
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,880
um so i think they take the messages

1410
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,079
pretty well from me

1411
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,240
but um yeah it's all about just spinning

1412
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,520
that message and making it

1413
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,119
i'm turning it from that scary message

1414
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,760
all that you know you must do x y and z2

1415
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,839
why is it important that you do x y and

1416
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,680
z and why is it relevant that you do x y

1417
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,480
and z

1418
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,880
great well thanks again um i'm sure

1419
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,400
