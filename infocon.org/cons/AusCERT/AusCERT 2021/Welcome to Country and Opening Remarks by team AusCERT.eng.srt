20th assert annual conference

282
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
it's great to be here in person we all

283
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,839
missed last year obviously it was a

284
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,720
difficult

285
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,120
it was a difficult time but as so many

286
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,480
people have been saying how happy they

287
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,959
are to be

288
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,120
to be here so welcome to everybody those

289
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,320
in person

290
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,680
and also those people who are

291
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,360
participating remotely

292
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,720
and that's quite exciting that we're

293
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,080
doing this as a hybrid event because

294
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,600
we've been able to attract people from

295
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,279
all over the world for this one so that

296
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,560
so that's really good so

297
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,240
let's hope the experience for everybody

298
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,959
is a great one

299
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,080
let me start with we're losing this

300
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,839
battle

301
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,519
we're losing the battle against cyber

302
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,480
crime certainly

303
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,279
and just this week we've seen critical

304
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,880
infrastructure the fuel pipeline in the

305
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,519
us

306
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,959
shut down due to ransomware

307
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,640
every week we see disruption

308
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,160
no actually no let's be honest let's say

309
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,200
we say catastrophic failures

310
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,839
to our schools our hospitals our

311
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,120
universities

312
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,360
and our businesses in fact generally to

313
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,880
our lives for those people who are

314
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,240
affected directly by those

315
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,320
and then of course there was 2020 not

316
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,480
just it also have to go virtual but

317
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,519
many of us pivoted to working remotely

318
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,800
and that was a challenge and maybe as

319
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,040
cyber security professionals

320
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,880
maybe we actually crossed our fingers to

321
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,320
be honest we probably crossed our

322
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
fingers and hoped that the workforce

323
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,560
and the businesses were going to be safe

324
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,040
during that period

325
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,959
but they weren't really safe in a lot of

326
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,120
instances

327
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,160
in the 2020 bdo or search survey

328
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,200
the results showed us accidental

329
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,160
disclosures

330
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,800
during that year rise rise by 60 percent

331
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
we saw data breaches from malicious

332
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,360
hacking rise by 90 percent

333
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,040
and we saw the establishment i'm going

334
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,000
to say the emergence with the

335
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,360
establishment of double ransomware

336
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,600
and we saw a devastating attack on

337
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,640
supply chain

338
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,160
which is really really concerning and

339
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,680
obviously there's a few big cases of

340
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,160
that

341
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,800
we can think of things that to some

342
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,680
extent were outside of our control

343
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,959
the fbi's internet crime report detailed

344
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:03,440
list

345
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,360
last year did great deep detailed 69

346
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,279
increase in the number of complaints

347
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,120
from the previous year

348
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,640
and they get a lot of complaints and

349
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,920
that's only the people who bother to

350
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,720
actually

351
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,839
to actually uh register something

352
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,519
the reported losses from those

353
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,880
registered was

354
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,560
4.1 billion u.s dollars i say that's

355
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,720
only the people who reported it

356
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,160
forgetting about everybody else and the

357
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,279
other interesting thing about that

358
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,120
report from the fbi was that

359
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,600
australia had the fifth highest number

360
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,880
of victims in the world

361
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,920
so let's be honest cyber criminals did

362
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,959
not face the same issues that we did in

363
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,640
2020

364
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,200
they embraced that chaos and they

365
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
pivoted in an agile way in a very

366
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
professional way

367
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,959
professional in terms of their their

368
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,399
outcomes

369
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,360
in 2020 while we were all trying to make

370
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,480
sure everything else was working

371
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,600
so what should we do about it

372
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,959
well it was interesting i read an

373
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,040
article from the world economic forum's

374
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,920
gender website caught my eye this week

375
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,880
and it said

376
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,000
cyber security is too big a job for

377
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,880
governments

378
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,000
or businesses to handle a loan and i

379
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,440
think those people who have maybe been

380
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,279
through some incidents recently

381
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,920
have an expectation that we can that a

382
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,680
particular party might be able to step

383
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,320
in and help

384
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,160
another party might be able to do it and

385
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,200
a lot of them somebody said to me

386
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,240
yesterday a lot of people

387
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
there will when you talk to people who

388
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,519
are in the industry

389
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,639
they're there and they'll give you some

390
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,760
advice but they very rarely are able to

391
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,240
deliver the actual the solution for you

392
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,680
to get you back up and running so i

393
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,959
think it's really important

394
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,920
to how we plan but that report also said

395
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,639
it's the important thing to do is share

396
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,000
threat intelligence and that's something

397
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,079
i think that we're very passionate about

398
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,000
we need to share threat intelligence

399
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,399
across

400
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,680
sectors within within verticals in the

401
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,800
sectors

402
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
we need to align our cyber education

403
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,320
with the market needs

404
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,760
and of course ozcert is part of the

405
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,600
university of queensland and we're very

406
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,240
strong

407
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,760
i'm very passionate about the whole

408
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,440
higher education community and there's a

409
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,720
lot of good things that happening but we

410
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,000
need to make sure that's aligned with

411
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,560
what the markets need

412
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,839
we need to sharpen incident response

413
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,320
capabilities

414
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,920
because it's not if but when the reality

415
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,680
is it's going to happen at some some

416
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,639
stage and we need to build security by

417
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,079
design

418
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,600
so those things are all fairly

419
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,519
straightforward i don't think we're all

420
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,079
doing it

421
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,639
but they're fairly straightforward but

422
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,440
we at ulcer

423
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,120
believe there should be one more point

424
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,880
made

425
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,920
automate to scale

426
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,600
and one of my senior colleagues last

427
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,279
week raised a very interesting point

428
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,360
and jeff who's in the audience said to

429
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,160
us when cyber criminals scale

430
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,360
they fail what does he mean by that

431
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,160
you mean they attract too much attention

432
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,120
if they scale too far they

433
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
fail because they get the authority they

434
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
get they get visibility to authorities

435
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,959
in such a big way the authorities act so

436
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,120
we'll look at emmett

437
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,639
and that was an example where it was

438
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,519
taken down because of its scale

439
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,680
but when we scale we can succeed

440
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,959
so welcome to the oscar 2020 conference

441
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:30,480
soaring with success thank you

442
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,120
hello everyone welcome to this 20th

443
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,399
anniversary conference

444
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,040
i literally can't believe it's been 20

445
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,160
years

446
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,440
i have missed sadly six

447
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
of those years but that gives you a bit

448
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,839
of a clue i suppose to how old i am

449
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,000
and the early years i suppose that was

450
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,120
back in the day when

451
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,800
travel budgets and things like that just

452
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,279
didn't exist so that's my excuse anyway

453
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,240
here we are

454
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,560
um i know we've got a lot of luminaries

455
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,000
and and wonderful people

456
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,800
here but there's one i just i think i

457
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,399
should call out i can't see

458
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,240
this person in the audience but uh

459
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,480
professor bill kaley the grandfather of

460
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,320
cyber security is with us at the moment

461
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,040
and i think that's

462
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,279
that's just wonderful one of my heroes

463
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,250
anyway

464
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,680
[Applause]

465
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,800
this is one of the things we like about

466
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,639
the offset conference we get to meet our

467
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,440
heroes

468
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,639
anyway um in our work this year

469
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,560
we we obviously set a strategy like we

470
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,959
always do and we knew that we had to do

471
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:27,600
something

472
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,519
to improve what we're doing with cyber

473
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,279
threat intelligence cti if you want some

474
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,000
acronyms

475
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
we knew we had to do something about

476
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,360
incident response and you know increase

477
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,639
that capability

478
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,199
and so you know obviously soaring with

479
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,040
cyber was born that's that's why this

480
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,560
this theme was was born because

481
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,240
obviously those two things go hand in

482
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,880
hand with

483
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,320
security orchestration automation and

484
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,040
response um but we don't just make this

485
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,759
stuff up

486
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,720
um there was a method to our madness we

487
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
we also had for our third item in our

488
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,680
strategy

489
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,480
engagement you so that that's why we

490
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,639
work at assert that's that's why we

491
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,199
put on this show um because we like

492
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,160
seeing you

493
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,800
learn uh benefit from the wonderful

494
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,240
speakers that we have

495
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,000
and of course in our work as a cert we

496
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,519
enjoy helping you

497
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,000
fight the good fight and beat the cybers

498
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,079
um anyway for those of you who are new

499
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,759
if you don't know who we are

500
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,839
assert is a not-for-profit we're not

501
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,680
government-funded in fact everything you

502
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,160
see

503
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
here is funded by the generosity of our

504
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,560
wonderful conference sponsors

505
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,599
so thank you for that

506
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,399
this doesn't happen without our sponsors

507
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,399
so please go and visit them

508
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,000
and of course the work that we do as a

509
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,399
cert is funded by our members and

510
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,160
if you don't know already our membership

511
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,920
is every sector in this country and

512
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,959
we've got some from neighbouring

513
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,000
countries as well

514
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,320
um so usually it's about a third of

515
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,079
education a third of government

516
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,360
and a third obviously private um i think

517
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,880
at the last count our membership's just

518
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,279
over

519
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,320
600 um members um

520
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,040
so that's that's who we are now uh what

521
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,839
i would suggest

522
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,759
is if you could uh please come and meet

523
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,079
the team uh we we have a booth

524
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,559
out in the sponsor exhibition and uh the

525
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,679
team is all here

526
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,000
and this is this is one of the sorry i

527
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,599
shouldn't say that we actually have two

528
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,439
people now working remotely

529
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,119
which is just amazing in the old days

530
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,559
this sort of stuff would have happened

531
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,400
there was a silver lining to the covert

532
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
cloud so we now have a new zealand

533
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
branch and we have a a new south wales

534
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,079
branch of oswert as well

535
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,599
so welcome to those two i'm sure you're

536
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,439
watching on the live stream

537
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,600
um anyway the rest of the team is here

538
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,039
so please come and meet them they're all

539
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,080
wearing oh sorry

540
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,240
microphone they're all wearing these um

541
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,000
oscer team shirts so look for the navy

542
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,880
shirt with the

543
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,679
um red osfirt team tell them what you

544
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,679
like or don't like no don't tell them

545
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,960
that just tell them what you like about

546
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,000
this event

547
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,640
and also talk to them about what you're

548
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,520
doing

549
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,799
what sort of work are you doing what's

550
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,559
bugging you about cyber security

551
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,880
what can we do to help mitigate your

552
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,000
threats

553
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
uh that's the team one of the team

554
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,360
though has been working really hard on

555
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,240
something

556
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,160
which i think has already been announced

557
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,320
on social media but i'll just put a

558
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,840
quick plug in for it here

559
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,240
we'll have a podcast um starting very

560
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,559
soon so keep an eye out for all of the

561
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,440
uh tweets linkedin messages we're not on

562
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,360
tinder yet but adam has inspired us to

563
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,000
do so

564
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,080
so have a look there and you'll see

565
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,760
we've got some episodes coming up on

566
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,160
on the podcast um also shameless plug

567
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,440
david mentioned that we work for the

568
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,799
university of queensland there's some

569
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,640
awesome staff benefits there

570
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,039
hint hint hint we are looking for

571
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,000
infrastructure

572
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,480
and developers at the moment all right

573
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,160
let's let's talk a little bit about

574
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,520
um cyber threat intelligence so we're in

575
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,320
a lot of

576
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,520
groups within our membership base and

577
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,080
some of those

578
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,360
i can talk about freely and others i i

579
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,400
can't

580
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,240
and and that's okay now i'm just going

581
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,720
to side track on that concept

582
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,080
for just a moment so when obviously

583
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,000
certs for many many years have operated

584
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,640
on the principle of trust so i give you

585
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,240
a piece of intelligence

586
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,480
you use that intelligence to help

587
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,400
protect your your constituents

588
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,880
but you don't necessarily reveal the

589
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,400
source of that information because that

590
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,080
would not necessarily be the right

591
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,720
thing now that worked well for many

592
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,520
years

593
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,280
but we we moved on cyber security became

594
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,520
everyone's responsibility you'll hear my

595
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,360
boss dr david mentioned

596
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,640
cyber security is everyone's

597
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,400
responsibility and that's a good thing

598
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,039
but what that meant is that senior

599
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,280
management then had to become

600
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,880
if not involved they had to at least be

601
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,280
aware so imagine

602
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,400
imagine the situation where you're

603
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,880
saying you know as a sizo or a security

604
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,600
analyst

605
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,840
you're saying to senior management you

606
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,960
need to be aware of

607
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,600
this thing over here but i can't tell

608
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,480
you

609
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,520
how or why i know about that that added

610
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,440
a whole layer of complexity to

611
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,520
understanding how do i actually

612
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
communicate to my superiors how to how

613
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,360
does my management expect me

614
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,720
to communicate now generations gone past

615
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,039
there was chatham house rules

616
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,120
um google it if you don't know what that

617
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,080
is it's

618
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,919
basically you know you can you can

619
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,600
listen to a conversation

620
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,039
you can take that information away but

621
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,960
you can't reveal the sources

622
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,200
that got a little bit more complicated

623
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,320
in my opinion at least

624
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,480
more recently because as soon as all

625
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,120
this automation and

626
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,799
interconnected systems that had to all

627
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,240
talk to each other as soon as that came

628
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,280
along

629
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,480
that concept got a little bit more

630
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,320
complicated so then we had the the

631
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,000
traffic light protocol of course

632
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and usa's got a really good explanation

633
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,200
of that on their website so you can look

634
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,080
that up

635
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,480
um this whole side track that i just

636
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,240
went on there was to say

637
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,039
if you're having trouble with explaining

638
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,760
yourself

639
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,240
to your superiors maybe point them in

640
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,280
the direction of

641
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,360
traffic light protocol and say this is

642
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,320
how it works

643
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,960
in the cert world or cyber security

644
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,520
world

645
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,679
and this is why i can't necessarily talk

646
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,200
about some of my sources

647
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,360
anyway back to cyber threat intelligence

648
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,600
and what's going on in that

649
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,039
so we obviously um we're involved in

650
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,039
quite a number of those groups as i said

651
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,880
one of those groups that i can talk

652
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,240
about is the

653
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,400
australian higher education cyber

654
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,360
security

655
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,679
service now that is actually a

656
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,440
not-for-profit organisation

657
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,000
just like us it's run by cordett which

658
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,679
is the council of australia university's

659
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,480
directors

660
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,200
another not-for-profit so here you have

661
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,280
effectively an umbrella service

662
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
sitting over a bunch of not

663
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,960
not-for-profits like us

664
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,760
delivering a cyber security service to a

665
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,000
sector to the higher education sector

666
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,880
now that's pretty unique yes i'm aware

667
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,840
there's there's other

668
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,280
there's other sort of umbrella groups

669
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,120
within certain sectors and there's some

670
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
great stuff going on over at the jcsc to

671
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,520
help with that there's other areas where

672
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
groups are actually trying to advance

673
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,600
cyber security but i don't believe that

674
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,640
there is anything

675
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,919
as effective as that particular group

676
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,200
so some of these these pieces of

677
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,080
information i suppose that we get

678
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,919
these come through to us from these

679
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,200
groups and

680
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,120
obviously our goal in cyber threat

681
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,039
intelligence is to

682
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,159
analyze it have a look at it pass it on

683
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,360
to you

684
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,919
if if that's appropriate if it's not we

685
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,520
might have to look for another source

686
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,320
somewhere and

687
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,880
figure out what what is the best way to

688
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,400
get that information to you so that you

689
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,120
can mitigate

690
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,440
the threats that you're facing so one of

691
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,960
our roles in that

692
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,799
ahex service the australian higher

693
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,159
education and edu

694
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,320
australian higher education cyber

695
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,720
security service let me get that right

696
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,559
one of our roles in there for the last

697
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,720
couple of years we've run the very

698
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,520
successful

699
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,000
information sharing and analysis center

700
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,159
uh the court at isaac as it's not

701
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,520
and our contribution into that is

702
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,000
basically intelligence uh let me give an

703
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
example our operations manager

704
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,400
uh jeff he'll he'll get woken up at

705
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,840
strange hours in the middle of the night

706
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,480
because

707
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,640
someone oversees that's one of his other

708
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,000
hats that he wears the international

709
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,720
liaison

710
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,880
someone overseas will have sent him a

711
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,159
tip off about

712
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,159
something that's going to be a threat

713
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,840
and he'll wake up and

714
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,080
maybe analyze it and stuff it into misp

715
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,159
so that it can be disseminated out to

716
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,919
everybody in that information sharing

717
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,960
and analysis center

718
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,760
so we've done that for a number of years

719
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,159
i believe it's working really well

720
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,679
again come and talk to me if you don't

721
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,679
think it is you know we can improve

722
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,640
but what i'm getting to here and and

723
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,760
this this is it so if you haven't

724
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,360
listened to anything else i said tune in

725
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,480
now

726
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,400
this is my challenge if you're in a

727
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,600
sector that doesn't

728
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,320
have something like ahex in the higher

729
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,080
education sector

730
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,080
this is this is your challenge go out

731
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,279
form a group it's not hard they did it

732
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,120
in higher education they did it with

733
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,320
very little funding i might add and

734
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,880
everyone remembers you know depending on

735
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,559
your generation where you were when

736
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,159
certain events happened you know

737
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,240
people before me it'd be you know the

738
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,679
first person on the moon

739
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,799
um for me recently it was what happened

740
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,960
during 2020 obviously like no one will

741
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,080
forget that

742
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,120
but imagine if you could say

743
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,200
hmm where was i when i made a real

744
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
difference to cyber security

745
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,520
and we actually started doing something

746
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,200
in our sector because you know let's

747
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,880
start small let's just start in one

748
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,520
sector

749
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,279
let's do something there so imagine if

750
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,559
you could come back and say

751
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,559
yeah i made a difference right there

752
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,120
so that's my challenge to you all now we

753
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,360
have some amazing speakers lined up and

754
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,799
there's four of them are about to come

755
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,640
up onto the stage very shortly

756
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,679
so uh sit back enjoy welcome

757
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,240
thank you very much for coming in person

758
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,679
and thank you to

759
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,520

760
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,440
are thank you for tuning in wherever you

761
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,000
