but we'll uh we'll

20

trust that somebody's there so kendra

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,719
and i

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,520
are here to take a look back in time

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,479
we're going to

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,040
take you back to the 1960s when the

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,400
airliner industry

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,640
faced a huge problem with their planes

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,200
being hijacked almost weekly

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,520
our goal during this talk is to take a

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,920
look at the problems they faced

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,720
what they did in response and consider

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,119
if

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,920
any of their their learnings can be

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,840
applied to infosec

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,920
before we do that though we will

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,200
introduce ourselves

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,759
because it would be rude not to then

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,600
after kendra takes us through the

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,159
the journey of the airlines i'll take a

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,640
look at a few other industries

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,079
and then we'll look across all of their

41
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,159
their journeys and see if there are some

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,280
lessons there

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,600
that we can adopt into information

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,079
security

45
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,880
our plan is to leave enough time at the

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
end for questions which i understand you

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,520
can ask

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,280
using the conference app

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,880

67
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,120
welcome and hi everyone from wellington

68
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,040
new zealand unfortunately you can't see

69
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,760
our view

70
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,239
but the sun is absolutely shining here

71
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,920
for a change

72
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,800
i'm a long time aussie attendee first

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,840
time ausert

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,319
presenter and it was actually at a

75
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,560
non-suit about nine years ago when we

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,800
were there supporting a fellow icings

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,680
board member

78
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,120
for one of your initiatives the

79
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,000
voluntary control standards for scada

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
that we thought why are we in australia

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,640
nothing against your great nation

82
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
but why are we there to celebrate the

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,799
great successes of new zealand security

84
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:25,760
companies

85
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,200
and so from that icms was born

86
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,480
i co-founded and recently sold a couple

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,280
of businesses

88
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,480
in the cyber security industry and as i

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,560
had some free time on my hands

90
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,959
mike decided that this was the time the

91
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,560
idea that we've been bouncing around

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,360
since 2018 and the kiwicon

93
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,319
that we really should step up and talk

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,239
i'm heavily involved and co-founded

95
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,400
community groups in new zealand first

96
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,040
tuesday

97
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,439
in project wednesday and yes there is a

98
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,319
common theme

99
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,080
that you can see going with days of the

100
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,000
week and we hope to introduce

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,920
particularly project wednesday which is

102
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,519
a meet up for people

103
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,640
new to us uh cyber security or thinking

104
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,319
about it as a career

105
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,840
we'd like to think that we could bring

106
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,879
this into australia soon

107
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,599
but i want to take you back in time to a

108
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,399
time that was

109
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,399
coined the golden age of lying

110
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,440
it was a glorious time

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,280
that is for those that could actually

112
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,600
afford it because it was about five

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,800
times the cost of us for flying today

114
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,520
it really was for the wealthy and also

115
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,360
for those that saved up for special

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,400
occasions

117
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
like my family did when my parents

118
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,800
finally took my siblings and i

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,040
in 1976 on a dc-3 trip from wellington

120
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,680
to taupo

121
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,639
those days you actually didn't need to

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,680
buy a ticket

123
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,240
sorry you didn't need to buy a ticket

124
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,440
you could just rock on up and

125
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,360
grab one straight away before your

126
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,800
flight because there was no

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,120
pre-screening of passengers or anyone

128
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,759
before

129
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,080
you got on the flight some of you

130
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,160
watching this will actually remember the

131
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,759
time where you took

132
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,840
any luggage you wanted it didn't matter

133
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,039
what you packed

134
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,800
and put it on a trolley inside the

135
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,120
terminal which was then wheeled out to

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,080
the plane

137
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,400
again absolutely no screening

138
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,320
the passengers would actually go with

139
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,919
their family and friends if they were

140
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,800
taking them

141
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,840
to the airport straight to the gate and

142
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,240
then

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,360
on to the tarmac anyone could go onto

144
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,240
the tarmac

145
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,080
you didn't just have to be jumping on a

146
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,520
plane

147
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,240
and then you would take your hand

148
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,039
luggage

149
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,199
again whatever you'd packed in 1976

150
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,320
my mother actually packed her vegetable

151
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,880
nights

152
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,639
because she said that the ones in the

153
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,759
motels were just too blunt

154
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,759
you put your luggage your hand luggage

155
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,600
and the overhead locker

156
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
which was unsecured but it was designed

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,039
for easy access for the passengers

158
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,319
in those days security was actually all

159
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,639
about protecting you on the ground

160
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,840
protecting you from pickpockets and from

161
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
themes

162
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,680
just having a weak mouth issues

163
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,199
um you dressed in your best

164
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,919
suits it was a special occasion to go

165
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,120
flying

166
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,680
you wore your best suit with a tie and a

167
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,960
tie pin

168
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,759
you had your best dress with your pearls

169
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,440
your stiletto heels

170
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,680
and your hat with your hat pins i think

171
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
you can get a

172
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,840
sense of the theme that's going on here

173
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,080
it's certainly nothing like that today

174
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,039
we dress for comfort and we're not even

175
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,840
going to talk about the food

176
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,479
but once you're on the plane the party

177
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,560
absolutely started

178
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,960
the drinks trolley came out immediately

179
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,199
and you were served copious amounts of

180
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,479
champagne and beautiful crystal flutes

181
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,440
there was whiskey and scotch all served

182
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,000
in crystal tumblers

183
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
and then if you're on an international

184
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,440
flight there was

185
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,919
actually a chef on board who would

186
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,560
prepare your meal for you

187
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,759
and well there was only one cabin

188
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,240
and everybody traveled as if it was

189
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,000
business class

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,199
as it is today

191
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,400
the whole premise of aviation and flying

192
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,360
was built on the idea that it was to

193
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,759
compete with the trains and the buses

194
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,319
and the ships of that period

195
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,520
and it needed to be easy it needed to be

196
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,000
fast and it needed to be convenient

197
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,199
and then it was wrapped up in glamour

198
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,759
the aviation industry went gangbusters

199
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,759
through the 60s and 70s

200
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,919
because it was an economic boom and

201
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,599
people were flying

202
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,000
the us government finally introduced an

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,960
aviation body inside the department

204
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,400
of transportation because

205
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,879
flying had taken off and they now needed

206
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,639
to look at regulatory

207
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,840
elements around it

208
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,919
but as aviation and commercial aviation

209
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:28,879
took off

210
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,799
so did hijacking in a five-year period

211
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,839
from 1968 to 72

212
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,240
and yet mike was me on the mass that is

213
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,159
actually five years

214
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,839
there were 326 hijackings around the

215
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,200
world

216
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,680
and 130 of those were in the u.s alone

217
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,640
and of that 91 went to cuba initially

218
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,959
planes were hijacked globally for

219
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,279
transportation reasons

220
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,040
they were to get out of political

221
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,279
regimes and in europe they were called

222
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,640
asylum seekers

223
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,440
or escapings but in the us they were

224
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,040
labeled hijackers

225
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,079
or skyjackers

226
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,440
because hijackings and planes going to

227
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,000
cuba

228
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,360
were so common people would actually get

229
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,160
on the plane

230
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,959
and say take me to tuber to the air

231
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,800
hostess

232
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,959
it made for a great story when you got

233
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,279
back to your pta or to your next

234
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,040
cocktail party

235
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,160
it was an absolute real adventure for

236
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,120
people

237
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,440
so much fun the airlines were following

238
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,560
the bill

239
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
flight staff were trained to actually

240
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,800
comply with all of the hijackers wishes

241
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,200
pilots no matter where they flew in the

242
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,080
u.s

243
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,040
carried maps of the havana airport

244
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,600
once you were there passengers and crew

245
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,440
were put up and what were five strong

246
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
hotels at the time

247
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,240
one was even purported to be on a white

248
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,560
sandy beach

249
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,360
there were endless cocktails stunning

250
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,720
beautiful food

251
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,240
and exotic entertainment what wasn't to

252
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,959
love

253
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,040
about going to cuba castro built quite a

254
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,959
little empire off the back of this

255
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,279
because he would charge the aviation or

256
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,360
the airlines and the us government for

257
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,600
releasing the planes

258
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,160
usually within 24 hours the planes were

259
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,279
back in the air

260
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,800
and returning to u.s soil the passengers

261
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,079
usually had a little bit

262
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,519
extra luggage with them usually some

263
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,640
cuban cigars or cuban rum

264
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,079
which was illegal at the time

265
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,160
but what's amazing is that during that

266
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,519
time period

267
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,200
over a thousand americans went to cuba

268
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,160
unexpectedly

269
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,279
it was so much fun that time magazine

270
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,880
actually even poached fun of it saying

271
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,519
and running an article about what to do

272
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,560
when the hijackers come

273
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,680
monty python ran a parody

274
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,959
take me to luton a tiny unknown

275
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,240
little village in the uk where the

276
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,200
hijacker

277
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,760
actually ended up in cuba

278
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,120
the us government didn't view this

279
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,680
saying

280
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,399
though they started to see that this was

281
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:28,720
an

282
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,320
escalating problem and they started to

283
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,200
put pressure on the aviation industry

284
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,920
but this industry pushed back they

285
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,360
didn't want barriers

286
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,519
in place for people to fly because

287
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,680
otherwise they'd go back to those trains

288
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,760
buses and planes

289
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,200
plus the cost of hijacking was cheaper

290
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,560
than putting in the security controls

291
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,839
and more importantly customers just

292
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,959
weren't demanding it

293
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,160
but pressure started to grow

294
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,720
particularly from the unions

295
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,320
and so the faa created a hijacking task

296
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,120
force in 1968

297
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,920
and there were a huge number of ideas

298
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,680
like building a fake havana

299
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,480
airport which was ultimately scrapped

300
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
because they realized the hijackers

301
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,600
would actually realize

302
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,440
that they were still in the u.s and not

303
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,880
havana

304
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,120
or putting boxing gloves on the

305
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,399
passengers

306
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,440
or injection seats to

307
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,480
eject them out of the plane what they

308
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,600
settled on

309
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,399
was the beginning of profiling they

310
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,600
developed 25 behavioral cues

311
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,480
which they gave to the ticketing agents

312
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
to look out for

313
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,800
they were things like people wouldn't

314
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,040
make eye contact with you

315
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,720
or they were wearing ex-military gear

316
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,279
as you can guess it was an unliterated

317
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,959
disaster

318
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,720
firstly the ticket agents weren't

319
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,399
trained properly

320
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,560
and the controls and the cues that

321
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,240
they'd put in place were

322
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,600
just too bored or wrong

323
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,160
at the time the senator also suggested

324
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,760
that maybe airports should actually

325
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,480
implement

326
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,680
metal detectors and extra x-ray machines

327
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,279
like they were using in prison

328
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,040
successfully

329
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,680
but everyone including the faa pushed

330
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,040
back on that

331
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,200
saying that it would have a bad

332
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,240
psychological

333
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,720
impact on passengers because they would

334
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,839
feel like they were in prisons

335
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,240
and like all things criminal

336
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,240
activity was growing and more criminals

337
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,360
wanted to get in on the action

338
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,959
now 1970 saw a shift away from hijacking

339
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,519
being about transportation

340
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,199
to now ransomware extortion and also

341
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,880
in some cases terrorism

342
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,440
we were in immune down under in 1971

343
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,600
mr brown hijacked from the ground

344
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,519
a qantas flight he told qantas that he

345
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,720
had planted

346
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,440
an altimeter bomb on this flight that

347
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,399
was going from sydney to hong kong

348
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,000
and that they just had to lock in the

349
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
locker of an airport

350
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,199
uh in sydney and they would be able to

351
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,800
see the identical bomb

352
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,160
that he had planted on the plane

353
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,760
they looked at the bomb and in fact they

354
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,680
ran some quick tests on it

355
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,839
and it exploded or the lights came on

356
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,920
even though they dismantled the

357
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,199
igniter on it at 8 000 feet

358
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,240
so the qantas flight was circling

359
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,560
for hours at 35 000 feet

360
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,279
the money the 500 000 was ultimately

361
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,959
paid to mr brown

362
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,279
and his conspiracist for his um

363
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:01,360
co-co criminals

364
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,120
and they disappeared in a yellow combi

365
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,680
van

366
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
because the police had forgotten to

367
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,839
initiate the chase

368
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,880
and follow him the plane landed with 15

369
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,199
minutes of fuel left

370
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,680
he had told them that was there was no

371
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,240
bomb

372
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,040
on side

373
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,320
but everything really changed in 1972

374
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,120
three fugitives in america hijacked

375
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,079
southern airways flight 49

376
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,399
and they asked for a ransom of 10

377
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,560
million

378
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,480
southern airways in the u.s government

379
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,720
were able to actually get together two

380
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,959
million dollars

381
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,279
but remember that drinks trolley well

382
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,199
those hijackers had consumed

383
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,079
all the alcohol on the plane and they

384
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,000
were so inebriated

385
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,560
that what was two million felt enough

386
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
heavy or heavy enough for them that they

387
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,199
believed it was the full 10 million

388
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,759
so they instructed the plane to go to

389
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,800
cuba

390
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,120
now if that ransomware had the ransom

391
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,959
had not been played

392
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,680
they were going to fly the plane into a

393
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,480
nuclear

394
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,320
reactor for the very first time

395
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,519
everyone saw that a weapon a plane could

396
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,279
be weaponized

397
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,480
into a device of mass destruction

398
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,839
later that year a vietnamese student who

399
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,880
was actually being

400
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,839
expelled from the us for anti-war

401
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:32,800
protesting

402
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,519
hijacked the flight from honolulu

403
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,240
he had a foil wrapped parcel which he

404
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,199
said was a bomb

405
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,240
by this stage some of the flights were

406
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,759
now containing ear marshals

407
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,320
packed the wrong flight unfortunately

408
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,759
because the captain

409
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,600
was also sick and tired of hijacking

410
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,639
of the crew getting hurt and injured and

411
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,359
in some cases passengers dying

412
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,319
he decided at a refuelling stop to

413
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,400
convince the hijacker to come closer

414
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,959
because he couldn't hear him

415
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,839
at which point he and two of the other

416
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,640
passengers

417
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,319
overpowered this student his tinfoil

418
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:20,880
parcel

419
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,559
turned out to be lemons however

420
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,000
the pilot had given the sky marshall who

421
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,480
was an

422
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,720
ex-cop the go-ahead to shoot the student

423
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,280
and he fired five times killing this guy

424
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
the captain decided that he wanted to

425
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,559
make a statement

426
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,360
he took the body to the exit and dropped

427
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,600
it onto the tarmac

428
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,960
the world priests were watching and very

429
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,520
soon

430
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,320
this image was beamed into homes around

431
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,480
the world

432
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,280
the face of hijacking had now changed

433
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,240
the public image had a very different

434
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,120
connotation the fun was now gone

435
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,080
and nixon under enormous pressure

436
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,240
probably to deflect

437
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,600
decided it was time to do something

438
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,480
and in 1972 he mandated that all

439
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,600
airplanes

440
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,160
airports must now have x-ray machines

441
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,080
and metal detectors

442
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,600
and on the 5th of january and 1973

443
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,919
this week live and all airports across

444
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,120
america

445
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,360
the media descended on the large ones

446
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,200
like san francisco

447
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,240
expecting to find disgruntled clients

448
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,160
and long queues but they found the

449
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,840
complete opposite

450
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,799
they found really happy customers who

451
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,880
for the first time in a little while

452
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,200
were feeling safe in fact that year

453
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,000
passenger numbers increased by 15

454
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,200
the next few decades were relatively

455
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,240
quiet with very few hijackings

456
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,320
in fact in 1991 through to 2001

457
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,080
and the us there were absolutely none

458
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,280
internationally there was more

459
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,559
such as the lockerbie bombing in 1988

460
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,760
and from those learnings internationally

461
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,480
we were now testing for explosives and

462
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,039
searching

463
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,960
hand luggage

464
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,799
and then the terrible happened

465
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,559
9 11 and within a two-hour window

466
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,360
the aviation industry changed overnight

467
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,840
many of the international controls that

468
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,000
have been created through standards

469
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,200
were not being used domestically

470
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,760
hijackers had actually set off the metal

471
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,840
detectors

472
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,039
and subsequent photos and images showed

473
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,200
that they were carrying box cutters and

474
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,360
small knives

475
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,240
however they were allowed domestically

476
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,840
at the time

477
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,080
some of the hijackers didn't have proper

478
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,120
id

479
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,840
but they were allowed onto the plane but

480
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,120
perhaps the biggest

481
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,159
failing was that aviation security

482
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,520
had been outsourced to private companies

483
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,120
it had become an increasingly

484
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,799
competitive landscape

485
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,000
and often the lowest bidders won it was

486
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,559
simple

487
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,679
economics there was little investment

488
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,039
in staff training they paid minimum wage

489
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,640
they didn't attract the best

490
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,679
of the best their equipment was

491
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,600
old and outdated the government at this

492
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,640
stage

493
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,679
took back over aviation because they

494
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,679
could see that private enterprise was

495
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,200
about turning a profit

496
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,840
back to the shareholders

497
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,360
right that's that's quite a journey

498
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,880
kendra um

499
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,640
i'm going to take a look at some other

500
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,240
industries but um

501
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,000
it's hard to imagine something being

502
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,520
quite so uh

503
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,720
traumatic and painful as as that

504
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,440
um the first one i'll pick on is is the

505
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,679
automotive industry

506
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,440
because cars have been around for longer

507
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,880
than planes um

508
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,400
over a hundred years now and um

509
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,440
so satan has to be a bank in fact even

510
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,840
the the very first demonstration drive

511
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,600
of the first steam engine apparently

512
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,799
crashed into a wall

513
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,240
so you can imagine one of the first uh

514
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,799
controls one of the first solutions was

515
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,799
the addition of brakes

516
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,640
and of course brakes had continued to

517
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,799
evolve initially

518
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,080
uh it wasn't primarily as as a safety

519
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,240
mechanism it was to allow the cars to go

520
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,880
faster

521
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
the faster you go the better the brakes

522
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,880
need to be

523
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,520
obviously at a lower speed those those

524
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,200
brakes are quite effective

525
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,360
in protecting the occupants of the

526
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,400
vehicle

527
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,600
and more so the pedestrians in front of

528
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,918
the car

529
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,679
but it wasn't until the 1930s when gm

530
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,919
started doing some of their own crash

531
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:08,720
tests

532
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,960
where they uh they wanted to understand

533
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,720
what happened inside a vehicle

534
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,559
during an accident what happened to the

535
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,840
vehicle and

536
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,799
to its occupants as a result of those

537
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,240
early tests

538
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,919
they established a number of standards

539
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,600
that they built into their production

540
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,440
line and

541
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,080
that of course uh included better breaks

542
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,720
but

543
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,280
in those early days a lot of the car

544
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,240
evolution was more around comfort

545
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,440
than safety if you buy a car and the

546
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,720
further the car

547
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,799
goes on drives the more comfortable you

548
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,159
want it to be so

549
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,640
the early additions were things like

550
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,600
radios

551
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,679
and air conditioning and a good

552
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,440
cigarette lighter and ashtrays for

553
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,720
everybody

554
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,600
not not uh safety wasn't the priority

555
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,159
that

556
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,840
at that stage in fact cruise control was

557
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,720
developed

558
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,360
and put into vehicles before that was in

559
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,039
the 1950s

560
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,720
before volvo in 1959 developed

561
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,039
their three-point seat belt

562
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,760
now good on volvo after developing that

563
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,640
as a

564
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,720
as a highly effective control to what

565
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
they saw was a problem they made those

566
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
designs available to all

567
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,960
car manufacturers because they were

568
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,120
concerned about everybody's safety

569
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,679
not only not simply just their own

570
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,240
customers

571
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,640
unfortunately it wasn't for another

572
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,159
decade after that

573
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,559
before the us mandated that car

574
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,320
manufacturers

575
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,600
must install seat belts and even then

576
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,559
they said they needed to be black belts

577
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,120
and only in the front seats

578
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,400
now unfortunately uh in some accidents

579
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,960
those lap belts cause more damage

580
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,480
than uh than they provide safety so

581
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,600
two years later those mandatory seat

582
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,080
belt

583
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,120
requirements um uh

584
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,559
were changed to include volvo's

585
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,760
three-point seat belt

586
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,720
but it wasn't for another two decades or

587
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,279
so

588
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,679
before a law was introduced saying that

589
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,600
people should actually do the seat belts

590
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,720
up

591
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,159
i'm pretty sure it was during this

592
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,039
period i remember growing up as a kid in

593
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,480
in new zealand and i remember climbing

594
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,559
up into the back parcel shelf of my

595
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,679
mother's mini

596
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,679
so that i could wave to the cars behind

597
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,880
us and no one seemed bothered about it

598
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,200
of course if that was today that was to

599
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,240
happen today

600
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,520
everyone would be horrible

601
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,919
so just like in the airlines the car

602
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,440
manufacturers knew that there was a

603
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,559
problem

604
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,799
and they understood how to fix it but it

605
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,760
came as a at

606
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,200
additional cost um

607
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,240
henry or the the ford motor company in

608
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,080
the 1950s

609
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,960
made available an upgrade they they had

610
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,880
this thing called the lifeguard package

611
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,919
that included

612
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,480
such safety essentials as those lap

613
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,120
belts

614
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,200
in the front seat um padded dashboard

615
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,919
safety glass and it didn't sell well

616
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,080
the customers didn't demand it

617
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,520
even henry ford himself accused mcnamara

618
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,480
of trying to sell

619
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,640
safety while his competitors at

620
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,760
chevrolet were selling

621
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,760
cars the truth was all the car

622
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,440
manufacturers were scared

623
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
they were fearful that if they even

624
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,159
offered a safety upgrade

625
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,919
their customers might think that their

626
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,600
cars were unsafe

627
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,640
when compared to a competitor's vehicle

628
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,480
when those competitors weren't offering

629
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,840
an extra

630
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,199
extra safety upgrade

631
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,880
in the 1970s it changed a little bit

632
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,760
when there was an independent body and

633
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,080
they

634
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,039
established the crash test safety rating

635
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,080
system

636
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,480
so they tested all the vehicles and they

637
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,360
came out with a

638
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,760
a number of standards that were applied

639
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,919
to all car manufacturers

640
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,200
and through that the safety features

641
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,880
started to evolve

642
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,240
quite a lot faster and

643
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,360
along with with brakes they

644
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,039
they improve things like mirrors and

645
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,960
suspension and collapsible steering

646
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,919
bombs

647
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,200
padded instrument panels um crumple

648
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,120
zones airbags

649
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,640
um laminated windscreens and and even

650
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,279
better seat belts

651
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,240
this uh the safety rating has evolved we

652
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,760
all know it now as the

653
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,200
the ncap safe five-star safety rating

654
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
and bringing it down to a simple

655
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,880
five-star rating

656
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,200
means that the consumers can now compare

657
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,640
apples with apples

658
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,880
they're looking at a simple metric and

659
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,799
they're able to pick a safer car

660
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,440
over a less safe part this means the

661
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,360
insurance companies have also been able

662
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:03,919
to step

663
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,960
in to incent their customers to buy

664
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,480
safer vehicles by

665
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,440
reducing the premiums of a five-star

666
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,159
safety

667
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,480
rating car as opposed to a one-star

668
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,559
region

669
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,919
now all of this is around the

670
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,000
manufacture of vehicles in new zealand

671
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,799
and many other countries there's ongoing

672
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,840
checks

673
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,039
the in new zealand is every

674
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,760
uh six or 12 months depending on the age

675
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,520
and the check is to ensure that some of

676
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,440
those critical safety features that were

677
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,480
built in

678
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,880
as a result of these standards are still

679
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,000
in place and still

680
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,039
operating effectively

681
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,720
in addition to the warrant of fitness

682
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,679
every vehicle is registered to an owner

683
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,159
and everybody who drives has a license

684
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,399
to operate

685
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,200
now as we look at the vehicles today

686
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,559
especially the higher end vehicles

687
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,120
they are starting to get a little

688
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,080
smarter

689
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,840
they're becoming more aware of their

690
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,360
surroundings which means they

691
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,240
are now able to anticipate and in some

692
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,679
cases

693
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,880
even avoid accidents

694
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,760
and as we move into the future and we

695
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,080
look

696
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,159
forward to a time of autonomous vehicles

697
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,480
it's anticipated that they will be able

698
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,960
to eliminate the thing from the car

699
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,600
that's most responsible for accidents

700
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,840
and that of course is the driver

701
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
the next topic i'll take a shorter look

702
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,440
at is

703
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,320
homes and building standards now

704
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,399
residential building standards have been

705
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,840
driven

706
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,480
they benefit mainly from commercial and

707
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,360
industrial

708
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,240
building standards and they like

709
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,559
everything we've spoken about so far

710
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,000
have resulted from quite quite big

711
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,440
disasters

712
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,760
in the early days the great fire of

713
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,480
london

714
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,799
resulted in building an urban planning

715
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,480
standards that didn't exist

716
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,880
before similar

717
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,440
catastrophic events often in those days

718
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,080
fires

719
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,120
in other countries and cities

720
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,799
also evolved into building standards in

721
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,440
those countries

722
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
new zealand is is no different we have a

723
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,480
few extra

724
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,880
building standards because new zealand

725
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,520
is on a number of major fault lines

726
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,240
uh so our building standards uh also

727
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,679
take into account that

728
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,760
every now and then the ground moves just

729
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,240
a little bit

730
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,880
beyond the way these structures are

731
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,960
built and more recently with the

732
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,520
addition

733
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,200
of uh how they are insulated

734
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,840
most of the the options in that very

735
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,520
first pitch that i brought up

736
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,240
are up to the homeowner the building

737
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,840
inspector might come out

738
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,399
at the final sign off at the end of

739
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,480
construction to make sure it has

740
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,320
smoke detectors and they're in the right

741
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,559
place but apart from that everything is

742
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,760
up to the homeowner

743
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,080
and it really depends on their own

744
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,520
situation

745
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,440
their their experience and their risk

746
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,279
appetite as to what they

747
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,159
they bolt on as far as safety features

748
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,399
and safety and security

749
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,159
in my own early career i used to install

750
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,360
burglar alarms i had a home i didn't

751
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,880
have one in my own home

752
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,360
until after i got burgled then my

753
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,440
situation had changed

754
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
my experience had changed and my risk

755
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,320
appetite absolutely had changed and so

756
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,279
uh the the next day an alarm was

757
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,600
installed in my own home

758
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,919
i remember in the in the good old days

759
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,279
not even locking

760
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,200
uh doors of our houses we we do that now

761
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,039
because of the risk of burglary

762
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,440
and just like in my previous example

763
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,080
this has allowed the insurers to start

764
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,559
to

765
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,760
step in and incent better behaviour

766
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,679
and they may offer a a premium

767
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,880
discount for homeowners who have a

768
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:18,399
burglar alarm installed

769
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,279
of course insurers will will help you

770
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,880
when it comes to fires or

771
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,399
earthquakes or burglary some of your

772
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,039
choices

773
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,559
they will leave completely up to you

774
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,840
my last uh other other area that i'll

775
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,559
take a

776
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,559
an even quicker look at is health and

777
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,000
safety

778
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,399
so many countries now have very strict

779
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,360
health and safety

780
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,799
legislation and here's something where

781
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,320
a risk in isolation while it may be bad

782
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,720
when it's considered at a much broader

783
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,559
industry or country level

784
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,880
it's large enough to require legislation

785
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,480
to bring it under control

786
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,279
so before a health and safety act was in

787
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,480
place

788
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,399
a lot of health and safety was managed

789
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,679
and

790
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,480
tended to be up to the industry specific

791
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,440
rules

792
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,799
and new rules were introduced typically

793
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,159
in response to

794
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,159
accidents serious accidents that had

795
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,799
already happened

796
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,799
so in new zealand uh new zealand's

797
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,039
health and safety at work act was

798
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,760
introduced in 2015

799
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,279
and by looking at injury statistics

800
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,200
around that period and i've looked

801
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,159
more specifically at fatalities i can

802
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,200
see that

803
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,440
in the time the legislation was being

804
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,559
introduced

805
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,600
and as it came into effect the number of

806
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
fatalities dropped to about

807
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,519
50 to 70 percent of what had it had been

808
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,159
in previous years so you can see that

809
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,080
the right rules at the right time

810
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,640
i have have a very quick impact

811
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,240
and one of the reasons for that is

812
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,799
within the act it defines who may be

813
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,720
held responsible

814
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,039
it talks about the person who occupies a

815
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,320
position that allows

816
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,120
them to exercise significant influence

817
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,039
over the management of a business

818
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,799
so what it's talking about there is the

819
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,480
ceo and the board of directors

820
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,640
and because the health and safety act

821
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,720
can bring prosecutions

822
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,559
and impose penalties that previous cause

823
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,840
makes it clear who will be penalized and

824
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,799
so the board of directors and the ceo

825
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,480
are personally liable

826
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,200
which has resulted in health and safety

827
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,640
featuring on the

828
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,559
the agenda of every board meeting now

829
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,320
so on to the lessons the first question

830
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,519
we have to ask

831
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,600
after looking at those those various

832
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,120
industries

833
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,080
is can we even look across other

834
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,360
industries

835
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,720
and apply their lessons to infosec

836
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,519
and i i think the the simple answer is

837
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,080
no

838
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,200
but it's always good to ask these things

839
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,719
that's the end of our talk no i'm

840
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,960
kidding of course there are lessons to

841
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,079
be learned

842
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,639
for infosec by looking elsewhere but

843
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,800
it's not going to be as easy as saying

844
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,839
they did x so if we do that too we'll be

845
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,280
okay

846
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
the airlines needed to make their

847
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,359
cockpit doors stronger

848
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,280
but better hinges aren't the answer for

849
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
us

850
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,879
car manufacturers were forced to put

851
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,440
the volvo's designed three-point seat

852
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,399
belt

853
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,280
for every passenger but the average

854
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,199
office chair just won't be safer with a

855
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,399
seat belt

856
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,599
every industry is unique

857
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,918
the risks they face and their responses

858
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,119
are unique to them

859
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,079
but there are some common things and one

860
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,839
of them is people

861
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,399
why they do what they do or don't do

862
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,000
what they should

863
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,720
every industry may be unique but people

864
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,839
generally act the same

865
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,960
those within that within the industry

866
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,920
may understand

867
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,800
the problem and how to fix it but

868
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,560
without understanding the issues those

869
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,480
outside the industry don't

870
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,359
don't know what the controls are until

871
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,880
it affects them personally

872
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
so people are resistant to change until

873
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,000
they understand the benefits

874
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,440
by being more transparent about

875
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,560
safety control and it being in place

876
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,119
it will allow the consumer of a product

877
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,000
or service

878
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,440
to make a more informed choice

879
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,000
and as people see companies valuing

880
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,240
their data and privacy

881
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,640
increasingly companies are turning this

882
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,160
into a competitive advantage

883
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,520
and through our journey we've seen that

884
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,960
terrible events

885
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,040
have actually been the catalyst for

886
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,000
government

887
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,040
and regulatory bodies becoming involved

888
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,760
and we believe in the infosec side we're

889
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,640
on that pathway now

890
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,640
a common theme across all of those

891
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,839
industries

892
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,400
was they did well when they were global

893
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,839
standards

894
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,640
that could be deployed down to a local

895
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,320
level

896
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,839
we can take really good local standards

897
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,000
and take them out at a global level as

898
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,520
well

899
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,760
we need to do it at speed and our

900
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,079
legislation and regulation needs to keep

901
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:30,800
up

902
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,560
as they talked about the fact that we've

903
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,040
digitized and done transformation in

904
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,520
five years in the last nine months

905
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,000
in the us just yesterday they created a

906
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,920
new standard cathedral

907
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,839
and one of the components of that that

908
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,280
we really liked

909
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,880
was the fact that they're actually

910
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,800
holding the private sector

911
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,000
to account there's almost a bill of

912
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,599
materials built in now

913
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,160
and to the services provided to federal

914
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,000
that will have to be supplied

915
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,599
you will have to guarantee what

916
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,359
libraries and that they are secure in

917
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,320
the code

918
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,680
and the versions it shouldn't always be

919
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,760
about the consumer being penalized if

920
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,359
something goes wrong

921
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,160
we believe it's actually a time now that

922
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,760
the enterprise of the software

923
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,800
developers

924
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,920
and service providers are also

925
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,160
held to account and we believe that the

926
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,480
public will be asking this

927
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,800
just with the aviation industry those

928
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,400
successful controls

929
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,800
when deployed at an international and a

930
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,640
domestic level

931
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,040
the rate of hijacking went down they've

932
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,240
only been 18

933
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,599
in the last 20 years we would consider

934
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,160
that to be a win we feel we're heading

935
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,119
down the track

936
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,400
of a pandemic or epidemic level of cyber

937
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,680
incidents

938
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,079
and we're hoping that this conversation

939
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,440
we've had today

940
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,480
has created some new thinking

941
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,960
and thought and started and provoked a

942
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,160
conversation

943
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,560
around some of the other lessons and

944
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,680
ideas we could bring

945
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,359
in we really appreciate you jumping into

946
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,240
our conversation

947
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,040
today and hope that there were some

948
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,560
takeaways for you

949
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,920
i think we're probably maybe a minute or

950
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,160
two

951
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,200
for a question if there are any

952
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,119
thank you very much mike and kendra that

953
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,040
was a very insightful and thoughtful

954
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,079
presentation

955
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,160
um nobody from uh the virtual or

956
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,520
in-person audience has actually asked

957
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,440
any questions yet but uh

958
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,599
i've kind of got one apart from the fact

959
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,880
that um

960
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,640
clearly we seem to be having a bit of a

961
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,280
dysfunctional uh insurance industry uh

962
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,960
around uh um cyber security regulation

963
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,400
and

964
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,400
incentivization do you think that um

965
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,560
that insurance could actually like in

966
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,320
other industries eventually become a

967
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,000
driver for some of these uh improvements

968
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,040
that we need to actually see

969
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,640
um so i think the simple answer is yes

970
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,920
if you look at the trend

971
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,400
of of how insurance companies work they

972
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,040
understand

973
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,560
risk very well what you may

974
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,359
find but we already have cyber insurance

975
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:05,920
in

976
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,119
in a number of states uh

977
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,400
number of situations i think what you

978
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,760
may find uh is an equivalent to the

979
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,079
the scenarios that we spoke about they

980
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,320
need to incent good behavior

981
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,440
so for insurance companies to do that

982
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,760
in cyber security they understand they

983
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,200
need to understand

984
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,400
what your current behaviors are and so

985
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,359
insurance companies are likely to play a

986
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,160
a

987
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,160
larger role in how information security

988
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,839
controls are implemented within an

989
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,000
organization

990
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,119
and they will encourage and incent

991
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,560
people who are putting in

992
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,040
appropriate controls for the risks that

993
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,400
they uh

994
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,920
they they currently face thank you

995
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,599
um hopefully we'll get to see you both

996
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,040
here uh again

997
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,440
in some years to come um having that

998
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,720
you've heard from the past

999
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,920
but thank you once again for the

1000
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,200
presentation it'd be really good to see

1001
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,960
you here again sometime in the future

1002
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,760
and thank you thanks everyone

1003
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,839
okay we've now got lunch and we're back

1004
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:25,839
here in the split streams at 1 45.

1005
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,359
i
