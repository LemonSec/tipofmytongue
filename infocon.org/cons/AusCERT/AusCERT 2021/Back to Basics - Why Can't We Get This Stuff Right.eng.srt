19
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,640
hello um so this is back to basics now

20
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,920
the slide does say

21
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,120
why can't we get this stuff right up why

22
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,480
can't we get this right it's pretty

23
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,040
much it it really is this is basic stuff

24
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,599
so for those who don't know me or

25
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,040
weren't listening to my intro at the

26
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,440
keynote um my name is jess dodson

27
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,840
also known online quite prolifically as

28
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,800
girl gems

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,560
so if you've ever come across someone

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,159
who's purple hair called girl gems

31
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,120
that's me

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,560
um i am an ex-system administrator so i

33
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,319
come from an operations background

34
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,920
not so much a sec background so

35
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
um it's a little bit interesting i am

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
now a customer engineer with microsoft

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,560
with a focus on identity and security

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,040
um came from an ad background and just

39
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,159
kind of

40
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,040
fell into being a security engineer so

41
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
now i'm one of you

42
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,239
somehow um so the cranky face that you

43
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,280
can see on the slide

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,760
um that is a pretty dead set warning

45
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,720
that i'm

46
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
pretty miffed about some of the stuff

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,080
that i keep seeing when i'm going into

48
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,280
organizations

49
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
and businesses and companies and seeing

50
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
some of the things that i'm seeing

51
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,599
um i feel like a lot of this is very

52
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,400
much

53
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,360
common sense uh but if it is common

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,080
sense and

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,159
why isn't it being done um so

56
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,920
if you see dodgy practices that you feel

57
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,760
you are guilty of

58
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,040
don't worry you're definitely not alone

59
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,319
so there are going to be things in here

60
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,840
that will make you squirm and i'm very

61
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,358
sorry about that but that is my

62
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,399
intention

63
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,079
um think of this more as teaching you

64
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,199
to reaffirm those beliefs that you

65
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,639
have about the things that you should be

66
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,440
doing properly in your organization so

67
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,400
i am your pre-launch security

68
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,520
entertainment

69
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,680
now with included means so we're not

70
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,320
doing a lot of deep dive technical here

71
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,040
um

72
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,720
there is way too many that i'm going to

73
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
be listing to go into

74
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
heavily technically but if you want to

75
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,160
argue with me

76
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,560
after the fact or have a talk to me on

77
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,440
twitter

78
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
or yell at me about something i've

79
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
missed and i will have missed something

80
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,880
i know i will have i can't include

81
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,600
everything

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,639
please do so um so i've broken this down

83
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,160
via the nist framework it makes it a

84
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,120
little bit easier

85
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,280
um and it was makes it a little bit

86
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
easier to understand where we're placing

87
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,000
some of these things

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
um most of my focus is as a blue team up

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
i guess um on the identify and protect

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,440
space because that's where we need to be

91
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,120
spending all of our proactive effort

92
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,199
um there is a little bit of love for

93
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,280
detect with a couple of tidbits for

94
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,479
respond to recover

95
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,639
now don't stress about writing anything

96
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,400
down i mean take photos if you like i

97
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,199
don't mind

98
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,759
um but there is a checklist that you can

99
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,360
go and look at there's a url at the very

100
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,120
end that you can use to be able to

101
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
grab all of those and tick most of them

102
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,479
off hopefully

103
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,800
or use them to then do some better work

104
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
inside your organizations

105
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
so onwards

106
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,280
i identify that we are really bad at

107
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,160
identifying things

108
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,919
do you actually know what you have

109
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,720
um is your asset system up to date do

110
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
you know the number of systems you have

111
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,160
the operating systems they're running

112
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,520
the type of applications that are

113
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,400
running on them

114
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,280
the type of appliances you have how many

115
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,440
of you can put your hand up now and tell

116
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,400
me that you are

117
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,560
100 sure that your asset system is up to

118
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,520
date and accurate

119
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,520
yep that's what i thought um so make

120
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
sure that you're doing audits and

121
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,479
checking so that you know

122
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,720
what you have um it's not a set and

123
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
forget your audit system

124
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
will change like your systems change

125
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
they are constantly changing

126
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,759
um i am yet to go into an organization

127
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,120
like what i just asked you

128
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,039
who has an asset system and an audit

129
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,479
system that is up to date and they know

130
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,319
all of their inventory

131
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,800
without having that inventory without

132
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,080
knowing what you've got

133
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,160
it's incredibly difficult for you to

134
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,280
protect your systems

135
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,759
how can you protect it if you don't know

136
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,639
about it

137
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,240
um and worse if you don't know about it

138
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,080
how are you supposed to recover it

139
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
single points of failure for tech are

140
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
bad we all know that

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
um but it is way way worse when it comes

142
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,319
to people

143
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,560
um one person who knows everything and

144
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,520
is the single

145
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,840
point and source of truth for everything

146
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,680
is not a good place to be they may feel

147
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,800
really good in themselves

148
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,039
but it is not good for an organization

149
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,960
i'm sure we have all worked somewhere or

150
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,560
been in an organization where there has

151
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,120
been

152
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,840
a point person who is the person who

153
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,400
knows

154
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,800
everything in the last organization i

155
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,000
work for his name

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,599
is ken hi ken um this person is the

157
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,720
repository of

158
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,160
all knowledge when it comes to your

159
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
technical systems or at least

160
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
some subsection of those technical

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,560
systems and we need to make sure that we

162
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:44,879
are

163
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,319
getting that information out of them

164
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,560
they are literally what i term as

165
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
walking wikis they have

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,840
all of this knowledge in their head they

167
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,759
don't have any of it written down

168
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,599
and the only way that we can access it

169
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,599
is by asking them specific questions

170
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,160
so what happens when that person gets

171
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,039
sick

172
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,000
or goes on leave or is a contractor and

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,479
their contract doesn't get renewed

174
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,319
or leaves your company and goes and

175
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,720
works for a competitor

176
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,000
we need to make sure that they are

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,680
sharing that knowledge we need to make

178
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,759
sure that we are giving them time to be

179
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,639
able to actually

180
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,360
put that knowledge down on paper and

181
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,520
provide others in your organization

182
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,720
with that knowledge um

183
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,840
having single point smes is

184
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,759
a bad position to be in just from the

185
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,680
perspective of business continuity as

186
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,479
well

187
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,599
but on the flip side

188
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,599
if everyone is responsible then no one

189
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,880
is responsible

190
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,399
so you need to make sure that your

191
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,560
business owners and your system owners

192
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,959
are actually owning their own risk and

193
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
owning the risk of their systems

194
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,360
and they have to understand that risk

195
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,839
it's no good being just a check box of

196
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,720
yeah totally i

197
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,000
i'm looking after that one and then it's

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,640
more of a

199
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,279
yeah i accept the risk except when

200
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,360
goes wrong and then i'm blaming you

201
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,440
and that tends to be what happens in

202
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,480
organizations

203
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,240
business owners will take the risks and

204
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,839
they will accept those risks

205
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,560
until things go wrong so making sure

206
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
that we have written down the risks to

207
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,399
those systems we need to understand

208
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,040
why those risks are in place having risk

209
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,720
registers a risk register

210
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,360
is your friend you then have evidence as

211
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,920
to

212
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,000
this is the risk and this is who i told

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,279
and they're the ones who said

214
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,680
absolutely go ahead um we need

215
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,959
accountability

216
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,800
and more than that and i'm hoping i've

217
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,560
got a few managers in the room here

218
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,519
we need managers to protect their staff

219
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,440
do not blame your interns

220
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,600
so just because it was right doesn't

221
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,120
mean it is still

222
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,480
right um the if it's not broken

223
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,160
don't fix it mentality is something that

224
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,600
i have butted my head against quite a

225
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,360
lot in organizations that i have worked

226
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
for and that have gone into to help from

227
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,480
a consultant perspective

228
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,399
and it's a mentality that really needs

229
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,000
to change because

230
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,959
it removes efficiency it removes

231
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,480
effectiveness

232
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,320
i hate the word but it removes

233
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,560
innovation such a buzzword and horrible

234
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,519
thing to say

235
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,800
um but it it removes the the way that we

236
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,880
can change systems to make things

237
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,200
better so look at ways to improve the

238
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,880
systems that you have rather than just

239
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,800
staying with the status quo

240
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
um just because you've always run a

241
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,200
system on windows server 2000 doesn't

242
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,000
mean you should

243
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,240
always run a system on server 2000

244
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,440
write the thing if it's in your head

245
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,880
write it down

246
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,519
um i know that it's tedious i know that

247
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,399
it's boring

248
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,800
i know that it's time consuming but

249
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,760
documentation

250
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,040
is so vital and so damn important and we

251
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,640
just don't see enough of it in our

252
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,760
organizations

253
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,480
um from everywhere in it not just within

254
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,279
security

255
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,360
but also within rit operations and

256
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,480
development work

257
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,360
so document absolutely everything no

258
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,279
matter if you think it's not important

259
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,519
it will be important to someone someone

260
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,440
doesn't know that piece of information

261
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,000
that you know um if you've had to do

262
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,480
something

263
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,399
write it down if you've had to change

264
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,320
something write it down

265
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,160
in security breaches this kind of

266
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,320
documentation is invaluable but it's not

267
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,200
just

268
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
insecurity breaches it can also be bau

269
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,839
but you need that documentation when you

270
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:28,079
are

271
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,320
trying to work backwards when the

272
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,440
proverbial hits the fan

273
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,399
educating users from my perspective is

274
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,000
still our weakest link

275
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,279
um we need to do it in a more meaningful

276
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:43,839
way

277
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,600
um and we need to do it in a way that

278
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,279
involves our users without patronizing

279
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,000
them

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,839
so we need as we talked about in the

281
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,000
keynote we actually need our users to be

282
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,079
more literate in what we are doing

283
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,200
from a security perspective so we as

284
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,600
techs complain about our end users

285
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,959
all the time um we really do we we

286
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,560
 about them saying that they

287
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,160
they're not doing the right things or

288
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,279
they're being insecure

289
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,839
they're bypassing our security

290
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,480
procedures um

291
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
we wouldn't have as much to complain

292
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,839
about if we actually educated them

293
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:14,480
properly

294
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
and actually brought them along with us

295
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,880
so there is no such thing

296
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,519
in my eyes as a stupid question and it's

297
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,279
something i say to all of my customers

298
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,279
to anyone who talks to me there is no

299
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,279
such thing as a stupid question

300
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,720
there is a question that you need an

301
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,880
answer to just because i know the answer

302
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,600
doesn't mean that it's stupid so make

303
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,279
sure that your users understand that you

304
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,399
are approachable

305
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,040
and you will not patronize them and

306
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,760
demean them for asking those questions

307
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,880
spend your time with them understand

308
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,279
what it is that they do

309
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,480
and then work out how what you do fits

310
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,440
with that

311
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,399
security and usability is a really fine

312
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,959
line

313
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,200
there is no point putting security in

314
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,000
place if it's going to defeat usability

315
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,079
our users need to be able to do their

316
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,480
jobs and we can't prevent them from

317
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,760
doing that

318
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,279
because that kind of defeats the whole

319
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,200
purpose of our organizations

320
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,639
yes we need to make sure we're doing

321
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,560
things securely but we need to make sure

322
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,399
that we are bringing our users along

323
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,160
and we understand what it is that they

324
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,880
are doing as well

325
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,519
so now that we've identified things

326
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,240
let's go and

327
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,240
sort of maybe protect them a bit

328
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,160
okay this is my big bug bear

329
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,920
when we talk about protecting our cloud

330
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,440
infrastructure everyone

331
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,160
immediately jumps onto the new and shiny

332
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,079
and sexy and wants to play around with

333
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,519
the cool things

334
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,880
no bat stop it naughty leave it alone um

335
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,519
as i said this morning before looking at

336
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,440
that we really need to go back to basics

337
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,639
and look at the systems that are

338
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,959
connected to our cloud infrastructure

339
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,079
um pretty much everyone is running

340
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,839
from what i can see in some form of

341
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,760
hybrid mode who here

342
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,040
is running 100 pure cloud

343
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,160
no one so we've got this hybrid model

344
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,680
where everyone is focusing on the

345
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
security and the shiny of what's up in

346
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,000
the cloud and no one's focusing

347
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,399
on their on-prem infrastructure at all

348
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,079
so coming from my background working in

349
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,120
microsoft

350
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,360
everyone wants to look at azure id and

351
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,480
all the shiny stuff that comes with

352
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,920
azure id

353
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,600
except they're hybrid and they've got

354
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,199
azure id connect

355
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,959
and their on-prem active directory is

356
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,880
still running on server 2008 our two

357
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,360
boxes so it's weak as

358
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,839
so we need to make sure we're protecting

359
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,839
what our systems are connected to

360
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,279
find your weakest links

361
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,959
we are without a doubt the worst

362
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,839
hypocrites

363
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,000
when it comes to what we tell our users

364
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,480
to do so we tell our users to do one

365
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,120
thing

366
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,720
and then we go and do something

367
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,320
completely different

368
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,000
um if you are an admin any kind of admin

369
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,920
you need to be eating your own dog food

370
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,760
you need to be doing the same thing

371
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
as your users so if you are telling

372
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,680
users they can't have administrative

373
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,920
rights on their local workstations

374
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,839
bet your ass you can't have local admin

375
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,920
rights on those workstations as well

376
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,519
if you are telling users they can't

377
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,440
install specific applications because

378
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,639
they are insecure

379
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,240
and then you're installing those

380
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,680
applications yourself on your

381
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,880
workstation

382
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,560
you bet you're asked if i come into your

383
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,760
organization i'm going to get pretty

384
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,240
shitty at you

385
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,519
if you expect your users to do it you

386
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,800
have to be willing

387
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,000
to do it in fact you have to be happy

388
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,480
to do it because if you can prove that

389
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,160
you can do your job

390
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,040
as a security or a systems or a network

391
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,680
engineer

392
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,360
architect administrator with these

393
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,120
security restrictions in place

394
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,600
then they can certainly do it as well so

395
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,399
it's it

396
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,639
feeds back that loop of ensuring your

397
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,399
users understand why we're putting these

398
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,639
in place

399
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,680
now the other one that i see with this

400
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,720
is c levels

401
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,320
please for the love of god stop setting

402
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,959
password does not expire on your c-level

403
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,920
accounts

404
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,120
i don't want to see cios and ceos and

405
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,440
sizeos with password never expires

406
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,720
they are in my eyes vip sensitive users

407
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,079
they should have just as much

408
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,320
restriction on their accounts as our

409
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,600
administrative accounts have

410
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,360
i didn't really think this one needed to

411
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,560
be set i

412
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,360
really didn't but it is public knowledge

413
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,160
back in

414
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,639
uh 2018 uh an australian government

415
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,519
agency

416
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,160
um had a penetration test done and they

417
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,920
were popped within 10 minutes

418
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,000
because all of their appliances had the

419
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,440
default password of

420
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,560
admin and password set so

421
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,279
please change your passwords do not use

422
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,800
defaults do not use

423
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,199
crap passwords do not use the same

424
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,959
passwords everywhere i just want people

425
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,000
to be using

426
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,920
secure passwords or even better go

427
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,079
passwordless make my day

428
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,760
i just want to make sure that we're not

429
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,919
having insecure authentication

430
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,799
um we've got password protection

431
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,000
solutions

432
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,959
use them and tied back to something that

433
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,319
i've said previously

434
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,199
if an intern has the ability to set a

435
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,199
critical system password and

436
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,079
sets it incorrectly and insecurely that

437
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,720
doesn't

438
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,959
mean that that intern is crap that means

439
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,960
that your organization has screwed up

440
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,240
your user onboarding

441
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,760
and your security training and your

442
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,799
security monitoring

443
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,960
when we're looking at storing our

444
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,880
credentials particularly things that are

445
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,600
shared credentials um making sure that

446
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,360
we are storing them securely so

447
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,120
there are password managers we have free

448
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
ones we have paid ones we have cloud

449
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,240
ones we have ones that are on prem if

450
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,760
you are paranoid about the cloud

451
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,840
i don't care what you use i am not in

452
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,160
sales i am 100 an engineer

453
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,600
just use something um

454
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,120
as long as it's not like an excel

455
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,039
spreadsheet or a post-it note like that

456
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,960
that's not password management

457
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,640
um and tied to this is please don't

458
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,880
block the use of password managers the

459
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,480
number of organizations that i see who

460
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,679
block this

461
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,000
within their orgs all you are doing is

462
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,760
forcing your users to create

463
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,080
insecure passwords allow password

464
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,520
managers to be used in your

465
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,360
organizations

466
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,000
tied to this one as well with shared

467
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
credentials

468
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,919
i don't want to see generic accounts in

469
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,760
your high level administrative groups

470
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,360
i don't want to see them there ever

471
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
anywhere any

472
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,120
administrative account that is in any of

473
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
your high level admin or root groups

474
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,440
should be a named user so that we can

475
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,480
track that back

476
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,320
in audit and know who did it especially

477
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,880
service accounts i don't want to see

478
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,200
service accounts in high-level admin

479
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,880
groups they don't need to be in there

480
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,559
get them out

481
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,160
we've got the ability to work out what

482
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,000
permissions they need and if you have an

483
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,880
application or a system that tells you

484
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,760
they need

485
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
from my perspective coming from windows

486
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,120
land uh domain

487
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,080
admin or global admin no bad slap them

488
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,160
they do not need that access

489
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,240
find out the exact permissions they need

490
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,600
and give them that

491
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,559
and only that you do not need root do

492
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,440
not pass go

493
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,640
do not collect 200

494
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,640
tied to your service accounts as well is

495
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,480
servicing your service accounts

496
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,520
so when was the last time you reset your

497
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
service account passwords

498
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,039
uh when was the last time you did an

499
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,720
audit on your service accounts

500
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,039
to work out where they are actually

501
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,960
being used

502
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,880
and are they being used for what they

503
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,919
were originally intended for

504
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,919
how can you be sure that an admin that

505
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,520
left 10 years ago that knew that

506
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,960
password off by heart because that's the

507
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,400
account he used to log into to be able

508
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,520
to do everything

509
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,960
doesn't still have access to your

510
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,240
systems using that account

511
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,919
because that's why we have our back raw

512
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,120
based access control

513
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,400
is your friend so please use it um

514
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
i don't want to see top levels easiest i

515
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,120
can't be bothered working out what

516
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,480
permissions i need so i'm just going to

517
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,080
go for the very top level and

518
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,880
go away with it an example from

519
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,679
literally

520
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,360
earlier this week a customer that i

521
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,120
attended your entire

522
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,400
msp of 40-something people do not need

523
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,159
to be global admins in your azure

524
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,240
tenancy permanently

525
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,400
no um make sure that you are fine-tuning

526
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,320
the rights based on what your users need

527
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,799
have

528
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,080
identity audits performed make sure that

529
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,840
you are doing some form

530
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,760
of privileged access management so you

531
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,120
can go through and make sure

532
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,720
when a user changes roles the

533
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,640
permissions that they have may not the

534
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,039
permissions they need going forward

535
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,799
make sure you are reviewing all of their

536
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,280
permissions

537
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,720
and when it comes to role-based access

538
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,960
control and this one is very close to my

539
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,600
heart

540
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,960
make sure you are limiting your

541
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,039
privileges so high rank

542
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,520
doesn't necessarily equal high levels of

543
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,960
access

544
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,880
just because a manager is a manager of a

545
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,320
team of administrators

546
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,799
that has this high level access doesn't

547
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,000
necessarily mean

548
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,960
they get that access themselves so

549
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,000
speaking from

550
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,600
my personal position i have actually

551
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,360
been in that position where i was part

552
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,120
of an identity team

553
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,960
who had domain access to main admin

554
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,559
rights over about seven different

555
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,360
domains

556
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,440
we had a new manager come in who said

557
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,520
you guys will have domain admin rights

558
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,000
i should have domain admin rights two

559
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,919
months of fighting and nearly losing my

560
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,400
job

561
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,280
because i refuse to do it just because

562
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,320
you are a manager

563
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,400
doesn't necessarily me you mean you need

564
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,919
those rights now it doesn't come down to

565
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,360
a matter of trust

566
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,200
well to be fair i didn't trust the guy

567
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,520
but it does come down to a matter of who

568
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
is responsible for that system

569
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,720
the way that i tend to look at these

570
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,559
kind of privileges are if you are not

571
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,400
the person who is being called at two

572
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,919
o'clock in the morning to fix that

573
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:58,480
system

574
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
when you are either hungover or very

575
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,480
tired then you do not need that access

576
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,919
and tied to that as well managers trust

577
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,679
your staff

578
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,440
you hired them for a reason right

579
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,200
trust them to do the job that you have

580
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,720
hired them to do

581
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,480
if you don't trust them why did you hire

582
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,280
them in the first place

583
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,760
if you can put mfa on it put mfa on it i

584
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,679
mean it goes without saying we need to

585
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,880
have mfa on things

586
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,400
um now i am not a fan of sms as a form

587
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,520
of 2fa

588
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,280
but look sms mfa is better than no mfa

589
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,039
i'm more than happy to have whatever mfa

590
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,880
you are willing to give me at this point

591
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,679
um and i understand that for a lot of

592
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,559
organizations

593
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,520
using mfa might be seen as very

594
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,440
difficult and very daunting so start

595
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,559
small

596
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,720
start with a pilot group start with your

597
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,480
administrators or start with your c

598
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,600
levels or start with

599
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,120
a small group of users that you want to

600
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,600
protect and then work outwards

601
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,640
you're better off starting somewhere um

602
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,000
and for us as administrators and

603
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,919
particularly security admins this isn't

604
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,400
just applicable to work

605
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,799
you are likely known to work for the

606
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,799
organizations that you work for

607
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,880
and you are known that you have specific

608
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,000
levels of access

609
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,240
so mfa all of your personal accounts i'm

610
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,080
thinking facebook twitter

611
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,960
linkedin github reddit slack all of

612
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,640
those that are personal for you

613
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,799
mfa them so that way you don't have

614
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,720
people trying to take advantage of your

615
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,280
identity

616
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,720
account segregation still isn't being

617
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,440
done

618
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,799
i am seeing so many organizations that

619
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,600
have

620
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,880
administrators who have a single account

621
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,760
that's it

622
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,840
everything they do is from one single

623
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,520
account now this is

624
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,159
very basic from my understanding we need

625
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,279
to have

626
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,559
at a minimum two accounts normal user

627
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,360
account that does

628
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
normal user things administrative

629
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,120
account that does administrative user

630
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,000
things

631
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,840
depending on the level of privileges and

632
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,000
access you have in your organization

633
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,640
you may have many accounts it doesn't

634
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,080
even have to be limited to two it could

635
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,120
be as many as

636
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,440
five or six i understand that's painful

637
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,720
that's why we have password management

638
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,600
remember

639
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,720
um look at using privileged identity

640
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,159
management which is an even better way

641
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,000
of going down this path

642
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,080
no one has permanent level access you

643
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
want that access you request it you get

644
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,840
given it you do your work it gets

645
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,480
revoked

646
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,840
so no one has that access permanently

647
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,440
when is a firewall no longer a firewall

648
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,679
when stupid devs put any any rules in

649
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,360
and it really drives me nuts

650
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,919
so please don't turn off your software

651
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:46,960
firewalls i

652
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,799
i like seeing software firewalls put in

653
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,240
place software firewalls are really

654
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,159
beneficial the logging they provide can

655
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,440
be really helpful

656
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,679
but it is no use to me when any any rule

657
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,679
is put in place i understand that

658
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,600
for some organizations it is mandated

659
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,799
that they have to have

660
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,799
a firewall on so you can't turn it off

661
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,400
so the easiest thing to do is let's

662
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,000
throw in any any in there and see what

663
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,799
happens

664
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,039
testing happens everything works and the

665
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,720
any any rule never gets removed

666
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,279
so please go back and re remove your any

667
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,000
rules and find

668
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,080
out the ports that you actually need on

669
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,440
those machines

670
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,640
um i really didn't think that needed to

671
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,320
be said but again i actually came across

672
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,439
this one not two weeks ago

673
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,320
um endpoint protection

674
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,760
it's not just for your endpoints um

675
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,960
we need to make sure that we're putting

676
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,120
it on our servers as well um

677
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,159
and make sure that we've got our

678
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,120
exclusions listed correctly and

679
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,000
putting in documentation around what we

680
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,679
are excluding on those machines and

681
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,279
don't just exclude everything because

682
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:47,919
that kind of

683
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,600
again defeats the purpose of having it

684
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,440
in place um

685
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,559
you don't want to make your systems sick

686
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,600
i mean

687
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,120
look how sad it is looks very sad

688
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,080
um the other one with this is your

689
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,600
personal machines

690
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,159
again it comes back to you as a personal

691
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,760
individual within your organization that

692
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,200
has a level of access

693
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
making sure that you have endpoint

694
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,960
protection and malware protection

695
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,120
on your own machines the number of

696
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,880
admins that i know that don't have

697
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,480
any of that on either their mobile

698
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,400
phones or on their personal devices

699
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,720
because they'd never do anything stupid

700
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,080
um raise of hands here who has local

701
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,440
administrative privileges

702
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,000
on their home machine using the same

703
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,520
credentials that they usually log on

704
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,760
with

705
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,200
come on i know it's more than that for

706
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,240
sure

707
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,159
so yes if you've got local admin rights

708
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,080
it means that stuff can run

709
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,400
so make sure that you are putting

710
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,520
endpoint protection on your home

711
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,158
machines as well

712
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,960
um encryption if you can turn it on just

713
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,720
turn it on i mean this is to me this is

714
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,320
a real no-brainer it's

715
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,960
most of the time a check box just tick

716
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,440
the check

717
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,559
box turn on the encryption

718
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,679
application whitelisting um

719
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,200
this is a tough one because i do

720
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,720
understand how hard it is to put in

721
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,120
place

722
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,840
so it is in the asd essential eight it

723
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
is something that we should all be doing

724
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,240
because we're all doing the essential

725
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,679
lakes we're all good little security

726
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,640
citizens

727
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,799
um but it can be very time consuming um

728
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,720
it is a very good line of defense and i

729
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,919
understand that when it comes to

730
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,600
workstations in particular

731
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,320
it can be very difficult to do that fine

732
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,120
tuning

733
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,919
of exactly what applications you want to

734
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:36,720
whitelist

735
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,360
so how about we skip the workstations

736
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,120
and go for our servers instead

737
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,520
because the applications on your servers

738
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,320
should not

739
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,799
be changing so we should be putting at

740
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,880
least application whitelisting on our

741
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,679
servers

742
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,200
um it's also really good for catching

743
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
people doing incredibly daft things

744
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,840
on servers again another example from

745
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
personal experience

746
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,919
installing tree size pro on a domain

747
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,840
controller to scan all of the file

748
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,200
servers

749
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,919
just no that should never be running on

750
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,919
a domain controller ever

751
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,200
um and as part of this learning tale

752
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,880
around that part of the reason why that

753
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,799
actually happened is because

754
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,200
your administrators may not have access

755
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,120
to the tools they need to do their job

756
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,720
on the systems you've given them

757
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,279
so give them legitimate workable jump

758
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,039
boxes that have all of the tools they

759
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:27,679
need

760
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,520
or make sure they've got those tools

761
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,440
available on their privileged

762
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,559
administrative workstations

763
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,080
please make sure we're patching our

764
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,640
systems not just operating systems but

765
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,720
our appliances

766
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,960
any of the applications that are running

767
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,480
on our systems we just need to be

768
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,679
patching i am

769
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,360
very tired of going into orgs and

770
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,760
particularly government organizations

771
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,960
and seeing like one-year patching cycles

772
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,279
no one wants to be installing one year's

773
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,200
worth of patches on their systems real

774
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,559
no one bad things will happen so have a

775
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,320
regular patching cycle

776
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,480
have things being updated frequently

777
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,919
you're going to be missing out with

778
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,120
security

779
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,799
vulnerabilities that are open on those

780
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,480
machines if you do not apply those

781
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,960
updates

782
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,360
physical security is still a thing so

783
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,919
as do we determine here not everyone

784
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:26,720
here is running

785
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,799
pure cloud we are still running in a

786
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,799
hybrid mode we do still have physical

787
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,880
machines inside data centers

788
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,799
and they're not always in colo data

789
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,640
centers some of them still exist

790
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,000
in our own organizations so who has

791
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,120
access to those physical servers

792
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,240
um if a bad guy has unrestricted

793
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
physical access to your computer

794
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,159
it's not your computer anymore so

795
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,799
don't have servers running under desks

796
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,159
um

797
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,840
make sure they are secured and monitored

798
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,520
and again personal experience working

799
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,320
with government

800
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,360
um i've seen it happen a remote office

801
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,080
disaster had struck there'd been a

802
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,399
natural disaster in the area the

803
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,760
server was literally underneath

804
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
someone's desk and someone just walked

805
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,000
in

806
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,360
and walked out with a domain controller

807
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,960
um so make sure you are securing your

808
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
physical systems because again it comes

809
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,159
down to that weakest link

810
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,440
so we've done identify we've done

811
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,080
protect

812
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,919
and now we're on to detect so we are

813
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,760
detecting that something has happened or

814
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,080
we

815
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,510
think something might have happened

816
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,760
[Music]

817
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
please pick and choose your logs and

818
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,039
make sure that you are grabbing all the

819
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,480
right ones

820
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,679
um you don't know what you can't see

821
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,159
so you can't track it back if you don't

822
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,520
have access to it so

823
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,600
event logs when we are talking system or

824
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,440
security or application specific

825
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,200
appliance logs i don't care what kind of

826
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,840
logs

827
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,799
just make sure that we are grabbing hold

828
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,559
of those logs that we are

829
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,640
storing them somewhere so not just from

830
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,960
a security perspective even from a bau

831
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,120
troubleshooting perspective those logs

832
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,200
can be invaluable

833
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,679
to your administrators to your end users

834
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,960
when we are trying to work out what's

835
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
going on in their systems

836
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,720
the other thing is is making sure we are

837
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,159
collating them and putting them

838
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:20,720
somewhere

839
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,799
because our logs are rolling over far

840
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,480
too quickly they do take up a lot of

841
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,440
disk of course

842
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,120
so making sure that we are putting them

843
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,559
somewhere that we can look at

844
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,679
them and we can understand what's going

845
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,000
on

846
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,960
in those systems um now the other big

847
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,760
one around this

848
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,919
and sarah young will be very happy that

849
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,039
i mentioned this

850
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,840
collection is not detection so just

851
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,279
because we're collecting them

852
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,039
it's great that's awesome i'm glad we're

853
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,399
putting them somewhere but unless

854
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,399
someone's actually looking at them they

855
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,760
are doing us no good

856
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,679
so make sure that we are actually

857
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,519
looking at these logs

858
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,080
now again i come from that microsoft

859
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,960
perspective

860
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,880
i am somewhat biased in the tools that i

861
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,799
use but again i don't care what you're

862
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,880
using as long as you are using

863
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,440
something

864
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,080
insider threats are still very much a

865
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,039
thing

866
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,519
we are still seeing them um so we need

867
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,960
to keep watch

868
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,000
and that includes making sure that we

869
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,039
ourselves are being watched and that the

870
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,559
stuff that we are doing is being

871
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,360
monitored

872
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,120
and audited to make sure that we are

873
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,559
still doing the right things

874
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,279
so we need to have monitoring over our

875
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,200
seam and saw tools we need to make sure

876
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,799
that any changes that are being made in

877
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,600
those systems

878
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
is logged so that we can actually

879
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,120
determine what has happened

880
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,320
we do have very smart attackers that

881
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,399
will know that the easiest way to avoid

882
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,039
detection

883
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,440
is to disrupt your security systems so

884
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,120
making sure that we are monitoring them

885
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,799
in a way that we can actually see when

886
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,159
they are tampered with

887
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,159
um you've got to break glass account

888
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,320
monitor for its usage it should never be

889
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,600
used so make sure that you're paying

890
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,080
attention

891
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,559
to it um you've got seam rules in place

892
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,080
if you've got specific seam rules that

893
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,440
are around

894
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,279
your monitoring solutions and security

895
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,799
solutions make sure that you are

896
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,440
monitoring for when they change

897
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
you've got security automation put in

898
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,880
make sure that you are monitoring and

899
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,559
logging when that automation is being

900
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,679
run

901
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,039
you want to know when your logs are

902
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,279
being deleted and being purged you need

903
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,640
to monitor for it

904
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,399
um it comes back to

905
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,600
we are not infallible we can do the

906
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,720
wrong thing

907
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,159
and unfortunately we do have

908
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,640
rogues and we do have bad actors who may

909
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,320
decide that they want to do the wrong

910
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,840
thing for one reason or another so we

911
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,679
need to make sure that we can catch that

912
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,120
before too much damage is done

913
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,960
fine tuning of your monitoring systems

914
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,039
this is another one of my big bug bears

915
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,240
that i come across

916
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,799
um there is no use in alerting for

917
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,440
everything

918
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,960
you will drown in noise you will not see

919
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,120
anything of value if you are not

920
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,200
actually tuning your systems

921
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
so you need to make sure that what is

922
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,279
being sent and what is being seen

923
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,560
it's legitimate it's actionable

924
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,879
it's something that's actually important

925
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:11,839
and you're seeing

926
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,960
as few possible false and benign

927
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,679
positives

928
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,440
and you understand the difference

929
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,280
between a false and a benign positive

930
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
we need to make sure that we're not just

931
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,119
standing up new tools because

932
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,800
we've seen a new tool so the number of

933
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,399
times that i go into organizations

934
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:28,960
they've

935
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,000
got this whiz-bang monitoring tool

936
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,839
they've got 90 of their systems

937
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,520
monitored using this whiz-bang one and

938
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,879
then a brand new one comes out and

939
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:37,679
they're like oh

940
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,679
shiny new one and they use that for the

941
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,719
remaining 10

942
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,800
and they get 90 of the way through that

943
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,440
10 and then another one comes out

944
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,679
in perpetuity so we need to make sure

945
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,119
that we are

946
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,280
fine-tuning our monitoring systems

947
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
themselves we need to cut down the

948
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,119
number of systems that we are using we

949
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,159
shouldn't have

950
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,680
a dozen or so we should have one that we

951
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,920
can look at and look into that one to be

952
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,680
able to find all the information that we

953
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,919
need

954
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,920
so we've detected stuff so how do we go

955
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,040
about protecting it

956
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,560
and recovering it

957
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,440
please back up all your things backup is

958
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,880
really important

959
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,119
um and when it comes to backup again

960
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,800
it's teaching you guys how to suck eggs

961
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,119
backups are great backups are wonderful

962
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,520
you can see the automation and you can

963
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,040
see all the logs that go yes the backup

964
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,839
has succeeded

965
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,400
you need to test your backups so a

966
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,839
backup is useless unless we can

967
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,680
successfully restore it

968
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,359
so please make sure that you're testing

969
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,280
your restores we are seeing

970
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,480
ransomware and crypto still out there so

971
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,839
we need to make sure that we are

972
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:46,480
checking

973
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,200
our backups

974
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,920
planning is key

975
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,359
have a plan any kind of plan um

976
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,119
and just like backups please test that

977
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,200
plan so we need to make sure

978
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,839
that we understand who we need to speak

979
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,440
to what systems are critical

980
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,200
remembering we identified everything we

981
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
have an asset system that's up to date

982
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,040
um and making sure that you're following

983
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,240
that plan

984
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,920
and also make improvements and updates

985
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,160
to that plan as needed and necessary

986
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,640
because a plan that was functional five

987
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,280
years ago

988
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,280
is likely not going to be functional now

989
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,560
for starters

990
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,160
good chance most of the people that you

991
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,560
would contact may not still be there

992
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,040
um perform table top exercises um so

993
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,720
there was a crikey con attendee that i

994
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,920
spoke to when i gave this talk at

995
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,599
krakicon who suggested that one and that

996
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,640
is a great one

997
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,720
um it gives you the ability to test in

998
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,400
relative safety how your plan will run

999
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,240
when an incident occurs managers

1000
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,599
back off i don't want to see managers

1001
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,040
standing around their security

1002
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,960
operations staff or their operations

1003
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,760
staff

1004
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,359
trying to work out what's going on no

1005
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,040
one works under that kind of pressure

1006
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,640
with seven people standing all around of

1007
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,960
them and i have been in that situation

1008
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,280
you need to follow your own processes

1009
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,560
designate a person

1010
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,599
that's why we have incident managers and

1011
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,320
let them

1012
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,839
be your point of contact

1013
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,839
it is okay to screw up everyone does it

1014
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:14,640
is inevitable

1015
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,760
you will screw up at some point um so

1016
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,079
own your own mistakes

1017
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,800
don't hide them don't minimize them own

1018
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,760
up to them

1019
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,839
help fix them and it's going to make you

1020
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,040
more trustworthy

1021
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,520
um and prove that you are more part of a

1022
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,599
team than if you were to try and hide it

1023
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,680
um the big one for that though is

1024
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,400
organizations who play the blame game

1025
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,920
so i want to make sure that managers

1026
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,119
aren't playing the blame game when it

1027
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,720
comes to when things go wrong

1028
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
you need to foster that level of

1029
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,800
accountability in your staff

1030
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,160
to know that they are not going to have

1031
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,839
their head roll if something goes wrong

1032
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,560
piggybacking perfectly off the last

1033
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,640
point ask for help

1034
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,000
when you need it it's not possible

1035
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,480
to know everything you can't do it all

1036
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,079
by yourself that's why we work in teams

1037
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,599
it isn't possible for you to have all of

1038
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,680
that knowledge in your head you need to

1039
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,359
get help from other people and it is

1040
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,040
okay to ask for help

1041
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,119
and find your tribe so i have a very

1042
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,040
lovely group of humans that

1043
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,440
are my my nerd tribe um and i wanted to

1044
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,560
give a huge thank

1045
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,400
to those people um so there's a couple

1046
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,599
of people bronwyn

1047
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,000
um she gave me some fantastic ideas for

1048
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,800
this talk

1049
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,040
uh charlie marie was my very first test

1050
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,720
audience when i first gave this back in

1051
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,839
february

1052
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,119
um heidi for poking me with a sharp

1053
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,040
stick to actually submit this talk to

1054
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,079
azert

1055
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,800
um and then oscar for giving me a chance

1056
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,000
to actually come and talk

1057
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,839
here this is my very first ozzer

1058
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,280
conference and they've got me as a

1059
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,400
speaker which is just

1060
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,520
insane um so make sure you have your own

1061
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,560
tribe

1062
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,720
and find the people who will help lift

1063
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,599
you up again

1064
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,520
you can't do it all yourself

1065
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,119
so this is the link that i was

1066
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,640
mentioning that links to all of the

1067
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,160
things that we discussed with lovely

1068
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,839
little check boxes that you will all

1069
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:08,560
tick

1070
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,880
because you're all awesome human beings

1071
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,800

1072
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,359

1073
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,400
back to basics

1074
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,079
that's why it's got that cute url

1075
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,920
so hopefully we can now go off and

1076
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,760
secure all of our things because we are

1077
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,280

1078
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,880

i have to agree with that really good

1100
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,760
even though we're even though we're

1101
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,520
talking about soaring and automation

1102
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,359
it's those basics that we still need to

1103
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,240
get right

1104
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,720
uh you know you can't sort of reinforce

1105
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,440
them enough so

1106
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,839
