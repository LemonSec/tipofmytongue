1
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,559
well welcome back from lunch

2
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,079
everyone who's come into this room thank

3
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,160
you for joining the vendor stream

4
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,000
um we've skipped on slides you're right

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,879
so we've got ricky calder here to talk

6
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:57,280
to us

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,239
about lessons or lessons as the slide

8
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:00,800
says

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,359
lessons learned around active directory

10
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:03,920
uh

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,640
if you have any questions please lodge

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,159
them through the app

13
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,920
so we can keep everyone on both on the

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,680
virtual stream and in the physical room

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,320
aligned

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,000
i'll be moderating those questions and

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,600
asking them as appropriate

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
so welcome ricky i'll leave you to do it

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,360
thank you

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,040
thank you okay so today's discussion is

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,400
going to be

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,360
more of a broad discussion around what

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,320
we're seeing

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,759
with the customers that we're actually

25
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,439
engaging with so

26
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,520
we're going to actually talk about um

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,640
active directory of

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
defense in the real world so you know

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,200
aed defense is more than a detect

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,360
and respond you know there's a lot more

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,799
to active directory events to protect

32
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,560
your credentials your data

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,520
and goes into the last result which is

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,880
you know we've detected that we've been

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,680
compromised

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,520
we need to respond you want to be

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,200
actually interrupting that train

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,320
way before you can get to that point so

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,640
i come across this quote actually in a

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,119
actually another vendor slide that we

41
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,079
deal with

42
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,040
i thought it was actually painted a very

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,320
doom and gloom picture

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,560
of actually the i.t space and to

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,000
security you know

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,200
if you're not hacked you're going to be

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
hacked and if you've been hacked once

48
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,080
you're going to get hacked again i was

49
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
like well

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,160
yes but you know if you do all the right

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,800
things

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,239
and actually understand the attack

53
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:22,959
pathways

54
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,480
um you can interrupt those attacks from

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,959
happening and have a stronger chance of

56
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,760
actually

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,879
stopping them from happening again so

58
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,959
you know a few years ago microsoft had

59
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,280
the guidance you know assume breach

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
the problem can't be solved by a single

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,959
strategy which is true

62
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,440
and you actually want to look at more of

63
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,080
kind of

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,640
identity parameters you know restrict

65
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,239
where your privileged accounts should be

66
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,080
logged into

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,360
in order for them to not be compromised

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,599
big problem with that it's very very

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,680
difficult to harden active directory

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
from an infrastructure point of view you

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,200
know you have network boundaries you

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,519
have

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,599
uh domain segregation you know accounts

74
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,519
unknowns service accounts doing certain

75
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,720
privileges that you just don't know

76
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,640
about banking applications that require

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,760
privileges

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,840
you know um organizational buyspoke

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,280
applications that you just don't know

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,040
about

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,000
so obviously microsoft and i've dealt

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,680
with some very large organizations in

83
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,200
the finance industry

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,440
over the last six to 12 months that had

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,959
tried to actually implement what they

86
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,879
call the red forest approach

87
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,400
the tiered approach to i suppose

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,560
privileged segmentation

89
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,680
problem with the actual privileged

90
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,400
segmentation of the red forest approach

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,480
it's very difficult to implement it's

92
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
very

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,040
hard to maintain and operate from both a

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,480
financial and

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,959
a headcount point of view and it becomes

96
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,879
disruptive actually to day-to-day work

97
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,280
in

98
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,480
um for your actual operations team

99
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,799
so what happens there is that you know

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,080
they find ways to actually

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,480
go around that particular security kind

102
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,680
of perimeter

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,200
and then you know it's all for nothing

104
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,480
this cost you an absolute fortune

105
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,439
and it only really works if you're on

106
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,080
premise

107
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
a lot of organizations now have hybrid

108
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,280
environments they move a lot of

109
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,879
infrastructure up to cloud

110
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,079
azure google workspace aws

111
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,040
um the ramp up of devops and

112
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
infrastructure as code has added a lot

113
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,479
of complexities to actually try and

114
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,840
actually do this kind of identity

115
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,240
perimeter

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,479
so when we're talking active directory

117
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,919
defense what do we know

118
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,360
no privilege compromise is key

119
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,880
if you haven't got privilege you can't

120
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
move laterally you can't move laterally

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,919
you can't gain king city kingdom so if

122
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,360
you gain access to privilege you can

123
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,400
turn a small breach

124
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,120
into essentially a big breach and you

125
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,840
know

126
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
lose control over what access to your

127
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,440
systems

128
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,720
um even more so if you've got

129
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,960
your domain admins or those kind of

130
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,560
sensitive accounts they will have access

131
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,199
to data

132
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,199
across your environment also you know

133
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,039
which leads to obviously data theft

134
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,520
ransomware tax compression we've seen it

135
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,800
recently

136
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,360
um where big organizations are actually

137
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,919
paying out

138
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,759
ransomware attacks because you know

139
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,560
they've got no choice

140
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,280
so when we're talking about attack

141
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,840
patterns

142
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,160
what we're seeing you know what we

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,880
understand

144
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,960
and you know these are these are real

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
world attack patterns these are actually

146
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,600
methods that bad actors insider threats

147
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,280
are actually utilizing

148
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,680
um in most organizations when they try

149
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,440
to breach

150
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,160
most recently in a large finance

151
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,759
institution

152
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,120
we was engaged from an ad protection

153
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,479
and a response kind of

154
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,400
engagement and we went up against the

155
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,479
red team and what we're seeing here is

156
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,759
exactly what i did

157
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,400
you know they've compromised an account

158
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,360
that count then

159
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,320
compromised a credential uh that had

160
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,960
privileged

161
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,400
that then used that privilege to

162
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
escalate move laterally

163
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,360
gain access to a domain controller and

164
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,759
then

165
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
try to do things like dc sync gain

166
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,680
access to more credentials so

167
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,319
no this is an attack chain it has to

168
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,479
have a starting point it has an end goal

169
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,000
so a starting point is always a

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,960
compromise

171
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,440
you need a compromise a credential in

172
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,039
order to actually do something

173
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,479
someone needs to be able to click on a

174
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,080
link for ransomware

175
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,759
attack but you know they can click on

176
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,840
that ring if they don't have access

177
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,759
you know they can't get anywhere anyway

178
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,240
so anywhere along this chain we can

179
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,919
actually interrupt you know a chain can

180
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,759
be broken

181
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,080
you know it has many links many kinks we

182
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,800
can interrupt

183
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,720
that at any stage to prevent that

184
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,919
precision attack

185
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,919
so that's kind of what we have we've

186
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,600
discussed what we're talking about

187
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,800
um with our customers and it kind of

188
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,840
leads on to some interesting

189
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,600
conversations around you know

190
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,000
do you actually understand your

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,759
environment you know

192
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,960
it's not all about the main evidence

193
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
yeah yeah we know we've got we've got a

194
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,440
pam solution

195
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,199
you know we've got all of our privileged

196
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,599
accounts in there they have to check out

197
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,280
uh you know it's not all about your

198
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,039
domain admins you know you could have

199
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,000
as simple as a help desk person that has

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,400
the ability to reset a password

201
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
that help this person can reset a

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,240
password of a user account

203
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
that has the ability to modify the

204
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,000
modified group member

205
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,360
that group could actually be applied to

206
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,759
something like your admin sd card and

207
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,039
have actually seen this

208
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,599
in customers environments um this

209
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,120
particular report we see here is

210
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,639
actually through stealth bits

211
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,800
um it's a shadow access report we've

212
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,479
actually shown this in customers

213
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,840
environments and had

214
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,280
you could hear a pin drop in the room

215
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,440
hey guys this account that you said yeah

216
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,840
there's no we don't worry about it if

217
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,360
that's compromise it has

218
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,560
the risk of actually compromising a lot

219
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,520
more than

220
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,160
what you believe it can so it leads the

221
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,759
conversation down to

222
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,360
you know what can we do red forest is

223
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,520
too difficult it's too expensive

224
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,280
the new thing now is zero standing

225
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,879
privilege which is essentially where you

226
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,000
want to get to

227
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,599
unfortunately to get to zero standing

228
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,599
privilege you need to understand where

229
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,039
you've got privilege

230
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,560
um and that's not just by um through

231
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
domain admins or schemer admins or these

232
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,160
horrible security groups that shouldn't

233
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,960
have anyone

234
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,560
but you know it could be by delegate

235
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,319
rights by

236
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,240
nested groups circling nested groups you

237
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,599
know you could be getting access without

238
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,120
even knowing you're getting access

239
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
so it boils down to essentially a kind

240
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,960
of

241
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,199
um approach that you need to take so

242
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,160
with least

243
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,360
least privilege also you're a standing

244
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,960
privilege you know you're reducing your

245
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,319
take better that's great

246
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,919
you know reducing the risk of your

247
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,080
actual if an account was to be

248
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,719
compromised

249
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,159
doesn't matter you can't actually do

250
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
anything that's going to be dangerous to

251
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,519
your environment

252
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,958
but you've still got to get to that

253
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,880
point

254
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,360
and with that comes ad hygiene

255
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
unfortunately

256
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,800
when i talk to customers about ad

257
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
hygiene it's like

258
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,480
you know yeah we do it we do it you know

259
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
we've got pam we've got

260
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,240
you know we have processes in place to

261
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
do stuff in the background automatically

262
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,760
for our hr systems and

263
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,000
stuff like that and so okay cool let's

264
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,160
have a conversation about that

265
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,120
you know we'll go in and essentially

266
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,760
this is the

267
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,360
approach we need to take right we'll go

268
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,200
in and we'll infantry your environment

269
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
and we'll generate you some reports

270
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,760
we'll show you

271
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,519
conditions in your environment that you

272
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,880
think you've got control of

273
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,240
but actually no you haven't now

274
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,880
as little as i think four weeks ago at

275
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,160
this exact same

276
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,240
exercise a very very large organizing

277
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,080
we're talking about 200 to 250

278
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,959
000 users seats and they were purely

279
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,160
focused on

280
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,839
what can you detect can you detect

281
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,080
golden tickets can you detect past hash

282
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,240
silver tickets and that it's like great

283
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
why do you need to detect that

284
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
oh you know because we need to be able

285
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
to respond to instances and it's like

286
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,480
okay but what are the chances

287
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
do you understand the chances of that

288
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,920
actually happening in your environment

289
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,320
and what what protections have you

290
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,680
actually got in place before it even

291
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,279
gets that point it's like yeah yeah you

292
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,959
know we're really really confident about

293
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,519
our

294
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,040
user accounts and you know the controls

295
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,600
and the

296
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,040
access rights that we've got in place

297
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,519
okay great i generated one report which

298
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,839
was a sensitive security group report

299
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,600
basically this report shows you everyone

300
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,120
that's in your out of the box sensitive

301
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,760
groups you domain admin scheme admins

302
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,959
enterprise admins and within that report

303
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,320
we'll actually show you some detail

304
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,880
around

305
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,519
the accounts of those members so one

306
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,560
they had

307
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,720
15 accounts in the enterprise managers

308
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,399
group

309
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,360
uh no sorry the schema admins group

310
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,399
which was like okay

311
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,600
guys already a bad idea

312
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,200
we then run a report to actually

313
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
identify where they've got weak password

314
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,560
utilization in their environment

315
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,480
so essentially compared against the

316
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
dictionary of passwords that were used

317
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,079
in known breaches globally like 600

318
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,760
million passwords whatever it was

319
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
um we showed them everywhere where they

320
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,920
actually had we password utilization in

321
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,680
the organization

322
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,920
we also showed you of all those accounts

323
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,680
which ones were admins

324
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,040
this is where the penny dropped again

325
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,800
you could hear the pin drop

326
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,560
the one of the admin guys that were on

327
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,399
the call was in the list

328
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,440
of them in a weak password we then delve

329
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,959
deeper into that and you said okay well

330
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,480
you've got weak password utilization is

331
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,600
quite bad you've got

332
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,920
historical weak password utilization but

333
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,360
more concerning you've also got shared

334
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,760
password utilization

335
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,360
so again okay you want to be able to

336
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,279
detect things like

337
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,440
advanced persistent attacks passwords

338
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,399
brain attacks

339
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,680
if you have an account that's compromise

340
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,360
or a password spray on attack that's

341
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,200
successful

342
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,240
and you've got shared password

343
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,000
utilization in your environment you've

344
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,320
now

345
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,760
compromised several accounts

346
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,920
unnecessarily so what does that tell us

347
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,800
that tell us basically your password

348
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
policy is not secure enough you know

349
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,760
you don't need to reduce the increase

350
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,600
the frequency of password resets

351
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,120
but you do need to consider the actual

352
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,640
complexities and utilization of

353
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
passwords in your environment

354
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
so again the conversation has swiftly

355
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,560
kind of gone from

356
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,440
i want to detect and respond to okay i

357
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,040
need to build stronger foundations i

358
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,079
need to

359
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,920
secure my uh my active virtual

360
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,680
environment i need to reduce

361
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,160
the attack pathway and that's really

362
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,279
where these conversations

363
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,160
we'll have in these sort of

364
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,320
conversations five years ago you know 80

365
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,600
hygiene here's your report

366
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,120
you know microsoft or some third party

367
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,880
company will come in and go this

368
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,639
this needs to be done we've done this

369
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,160
poor configuration active directory

370
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,440
we're still seeing exactly the same

371
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,839
issues so

372
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,480
we kind of when we talk about that story

373
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,240
of you know id defense you know

374
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,160
things you need to do to better your

375
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,000
security posture

376
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
always start with the conversation about

377
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,839
ad hygiene the reason is that's where

378
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,880
your credentials are stored

379
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,639
that's where your accounts are that's

380
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,639
where typically you get

381
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,320
the rights to authenticate against your

382
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,839
file systems which

383
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,200
as well your corporate data which is

384
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,680
your sensitive information so

385
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,959
it's not something that we should be

386
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,480
taking lightly you know i know it's

387
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,959
fancy these days to talk about saws and

388
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,279
instant sponsor and machine learning but

389
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,480
unless you get the basic rights it

390
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,519
doesn't really matter

391
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,000
so the five five-step approach that we

392
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,519
typically take you know infantry and

393
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,720
analyze

394
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,639
it doesn't take much to actually

395
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,920
understand

396
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,440
what your active directory environment

397
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,160
looks like you know 80's been around for

398
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,800
20 years or not so now lots of mergers

399
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,320
lots of migrations

400
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,680
lots of changes have happened in

401
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,760
environment you know in source and

402
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,200
outsourcing all this adds to

403
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,720
complexities in active directory

404
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,880
where no one actually knows what is

405
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,079
going on

406
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,480
so infantry and analyzer information

407
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,680
find out where you've got toxic

408
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,399
conditions

409
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,920
poor conditions such as you know circle

410
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,760
and nested groups you know

411
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,839
style users users that haven't logged in

412
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,240
for x amount of months you know do they

413
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,680
need to be in the environment no well if

414
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,880
they're not being utilized

415
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
get rid of them stripping them out of

416
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,160
their group membership

417
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,720
put them into a disabled ou no one still

418
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,360
wants them

419
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,720
delete them for a period of time so

420
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
these are basic things that any

421
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
operation teams can actually do and you

422
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,040
can automate

423
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,360
quite simply um so that's that kind of

424
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,560
clean up phase let's

425
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,480
reduce the amount of mess we have in

426
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,240
active directory let's make it cleaner

427
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
let's make it easier

428
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,320
to find where we have issues now we can

429
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,920
actually monitor so we've cleaned up all

430
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,519
the stuff that's now relevant

431
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,959
now we know what stuff is relevant

432
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,839
what's privileged accounts

433
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,360
um what user accounts are not

434
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,800
necessarily highly privileged but we

435
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,320
need to actually monitor for

436
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,760
so we can actually look for monitor

437
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,680
changes for those particular accounts

438
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,720
any unusual behavior once we understand

439
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,160
that then you can protect those you can

440
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,360
put blocking policies in place you can

441
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,680
remove privilege altogether with these

442
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,040
kind of five steps

443
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
you know this is how we're actually

444
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,079
getting um

445
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,519
to that point where we can go you know

446
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,680
what we can actually safely now look

447
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,959
at that zero standing privilege so

448
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,800
with zero standing privileges you know

449
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,240
people already they go yeah but you know

450
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,320
i've got a pam solution

451
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,519
i went into a customer uh last year

452
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,480
um just to do some sort of true up and

453
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,760
we kind of did a health check

454
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,399
and was like okay great we actually see

455
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,399
that their user account went up by 2 000

456
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,600
users

457
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,160
we analyzed those users there were 2 000

458
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,600
pound accounts

459
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,440
so great you've got the accounts under

460
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,959
control

461
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,480
but they still have privilege they still

462
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,240
have privilege at rest they're still

463
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,040
subject to compromise um and if i don't

464
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
know if anyone has actually looked at

465
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,639
some of the passwords or even curated

466
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,399
the dictionary um to

467
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,839
passwords that have been used more than

468
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,600
once in the breaches

469
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,199
there's some complex passwords in there

470
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,040
that are actually from those kind of

471
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,599
faults within those pam solutions so

472
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,839
if we need to get to that zero standard

473
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,839
approach well what can actually we do

474
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,959
um you know

475
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,360
what can we do yes don't panic for one

476
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,040
don't ignore it and turn away i'll

477
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,120
actually get to some stories about

478
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,880
real life scenarios where customers have

479
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,160
actually done that

480
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,519
and i've come back and seen it they've

481
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,000
done that um but what can we do

482
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,959
with um zero standing privilege well a

483
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,560
modern pound solution

484
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,440
should have the ability to create

485
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,480
privileged accounts

486
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,959
on the flyer what that gives you the

487
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:51,759
ability to do is

488
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,680
create those accounts give the right

489
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,120
just when they need the rights when

490
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
you're done with it

491
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,000
revert the change delete the account

492
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,680
there is no count that rest there's no

493
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,800
privilege at rest

494
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,720
apart from the account that you utilize

495
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
in which you will have monitor

496
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,920
you'll have control you'll have

497
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,079
protected one account is a lot

498
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,480
more one to five accounts is a lot

499
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,360
easier to control than 2 000 accounts

500
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,040
so that's kind of some of the

501
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,320
recommendations and how our

502
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,120
conversations actually steer

503
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,560
so why do we want that

504
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,360
kind of you know the mitigation the risk

505
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,079
reduction

506
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,160
um understand and reduce the uh the

507
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,440
attack pathway

508
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,279
at the moment if you speak to any sock

509
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,199
you know there's death by dashboard

510
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,560
they've got millions of different

511
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,959
dashboards through their scene platform

512
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,240
showing them all statistics that they're

513
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,480
not really pretty paying attention to

514
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,720
if you're sending everything up it gets

515
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,639
harder to actually identify

516
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,399
where you do have a problem where you

517
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,320
have been breached someone could try and

518
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,279
slip under there with

519
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,600
what looks like usual you usual user

520
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,120
behavior but you don't know because

521
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,880
you've got a million events

522
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,480
so what you actually want to try and do

523
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,079
is actually reduce the events that are

524
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,240
actually going up to your sync platform

525
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,279
you want to do that obviously for a

526
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,600
number reasons one operational cost

527
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,000
seems ain't cheap the storage

528
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,520
utilization from a lot of these things

529
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,319
platforms

530
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,319
then they talk about data retention yeah

531
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,559
you know minimum 12 month day retention

532
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,520
the same platform

533
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,599
storage becomes a big big concern than a

534
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,880
big cost you know

535
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,079
you don't necessarily need to do that

536
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,520
you're not seeing all noise events up

537
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,079
there

538
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,119
so reduce that noise to event ratio it's

539
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,640
keeps for actually a successful

540
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,640
you know sock being able to do their job

541
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,400
the other thing is is if you've got too

542
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,760
much information

543
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,679
you just might be overwhelmed and just

544
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,960
ignore it

545
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,400
i'll say that because i've experienced

546
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,320
it actually our customer

547
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,559
had a customer recall saying hey what do

548
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,080
these alerts mean

549
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,280
i jumped on them i go okay we'd only

550
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,640
enabled analytics and these were

551
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,000
basically these were threshold based on

552
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,520
leaks they weren't even machine learning

553
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,240
or anything

554
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,360
smart every one of them had triggered

555
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,240
and i mean like a christmas tree trigger

556
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,280
so

557
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,360
i reviewed the data and i was like guys

558
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,559
you're actually generally

559
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,320
been breached you're actually under

560
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,240
attack so we said

561
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,760
this is the ip address where it's coming

562
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,679
from it's an external app address

563
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,799
these are the accounts that have been

564
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,679
compromised you've got concurrent logins

565
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,640
from the same account across 20 machines

566
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,760
within the last

567
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,520
three minutes that's not useful

568
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,840
behaviour so this is what you need to do

569
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,039
so we actually gave them

570
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,600
an action plan just for their network

571
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,400
team to

572
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,840
prevent that happy address from getting

573
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,520
into the environment we told them these

574
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,720
are the accounts that you need to

575
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,200
reset maybe remove privilege temporarily

576
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,480
until you understand what the actual

577
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,600
damage is done

578
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,799
and it was like okay great great you

579
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,400
know we'll get back to you until then so

580
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,360
a week's past

581
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
haven't heard anything let me contact

582
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,840
this customer and find out what's going

583
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,360
on jumped on a cordless customer they'd

584
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,200
switched all the analytics off

585
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,400
i was like did you manage to do it's

586
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,080
like no because that was just too much

587
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,840
noise we were getting too much

588
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,200
you know too much feedback from our

589
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,160
management so we just switched it off

590
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,200
these guys had all the right tools

591
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,960
they just got too overwhelmed because

592
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,559
they didn't utilize the tools that they

593
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:00,880
had

594
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,440
effectively they didn't utilize the

595
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,200
actual ad hygiene so they had a lot of

596
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,160
privileged accounts that they didn't

597
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,360
even know they had

598
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,600
um and essentially they just they kind

599
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,760
of just gave up

600
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,320
so it's um it is a real world scenario

601
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,520
it does happen and it's quite

602
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,080
frightening

603
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,679
this particular company was a utilities

604
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,919
company as well and considering

605
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,440
what's recently happened in the us it's

606
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
quite frightening to actually understand

607
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,880
that's the case so

608
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,120
the problem then becomes well where does

609
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,400
it sit

610
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
it's an operational task is there a

611
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,559
security task

612
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,160
that's you know that's debatable but

613
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,600
really this is where

614
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,320
that uh that team segmentation needs to

615
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,280
kind of

616
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,480
needs to be dropped you know your

617
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,760
security team should be working with

618
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,280
your operational team

619
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,480
to understand that pathway so both teams

620
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,000
can act and um be proactive

621
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,440
and not reactive to actually when it

622
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,240
comes to active directory uh defense

623
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,240
um there was another one recently

624
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,280
where um

625
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,400
we actually did a just a quick poc

626
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,799
um we did it in a cloud lab and the

627
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,919
customer was like this is really really

628
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,360
good because it was all that fancy

629
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,480
threat detection stuff

630
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,240
it was like we'd like to poc it in our

631
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,000
environment so sure

632
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,919
sure we'll get on the call with them we

633
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,120
installed

634
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,760
20 minutes inventory their environment

635
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,919
showed them some of the key reports

636
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,799
so again um sensiem security group

637
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,559
membership was incredibly high and

638
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,600
really really stupid

639
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,080
they had accounts in there that were

640
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,000
clearly generic accounts with password

641
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,120
ages over a three years um passwords

642
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,960
were set to never expire

643
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,799
you know you're just asking for trouble

644
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,720
when you've got conditions in your

645
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,840
environment

646
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,120
they're that bad right so

647
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,039
we recommended okay your first approach

648
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,880
you need to clean up you need to reduce

649
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,280
your

650
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,159
uh your freight uh front pathways so

651
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:54,640
you've got

652
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,159
a better indication when it comes to

653
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,840
that detection response

654
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,039
um we talked about um

655
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,200
breaking that attack chain how can we

656
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,559
break that attack chain

657
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,559
you know um i think a lot of the

658
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,640
conversation at the beginning

659
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,880
was around you know detection of stolen

660
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,400
tickets they were obsessed with stolen

661
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,200
tickets

662
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,760
it's like great to get us that to

663
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,120
actually steal a ticket you need

664
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,559
privilege

665
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,240
you know in order for you to gain

666
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,760
privilege you need to go and compromise

667
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,480
your account

668
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,000
the conversation comes back to the root

669
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,919
cause ad hygiene

670
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,360
you know reduced amount of

671
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,039
over-production access you've got

672
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,159
reduce the the chance or you know you

673
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,280
don't want to give the keys

674
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,120
to an attacker and make it easy for them

675
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,960
you know if you put up enough hurdles

676
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,000
they will give up

677
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,080
that's you know i mean there was some

678
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,679
studies recently to actually act

679
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,120
um that pointed to the fact that you

680
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,799
know with enough kinks in a chain or

681
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,080
enough breaks in that chain

682
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,520
and a bad actor will just give up and

683
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,120
move on to its next target

684
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
you know so now you can start looking at

685
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,960
well what controls can i do

686
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,880
you know everyone wants to be a domain

687
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,320
admin when you're talking to operation

688
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,000
teams i need to i know i used to work in

689
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,039
an operational team

690
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,480
so i'm speaking from experience when

691
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,919
we'll get an order in and the high life

692
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:02,240
team

693
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,799
members go oh but i need i need the main

694
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,960
admin to do my job

695
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,480
what rights within the main open do you

696
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,159
actually need to do i need to log into a

697
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:10,880
server

698
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,720
you don't need domain names to do that

699
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,919
oh i i need to do

700
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,240
this web server application and stuff

701
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,440
you don't need the main evidence to do

702
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,000
that

703
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,960
so it starts to become the cleanup of

704
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,640
essentially lazy it

705
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,039
you know i know from getting up at four

706
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,799
in the morning for a

707
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,640
a call that's because i'm on call

708
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,320
evening and a server has gone down and

709
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,440
you're trying to find your credentials

710
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,720
you're trying to wake up and remember

711
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,440
what it is you actually need to be doing

712
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,520
so if you're putting too many obstacles

713
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,880
in place

714
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,760
and over complicate your security um

715
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,840
policies

716
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,240
your admins will work around those

717
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,200
policies it's

718
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,039
it's an unfortunate fact whether that's

719
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,039
the case um

720
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,559
so it's definitely focus should always

721
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,400
your initial focus should always be

722
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,720
understanding of my attack pathways

723
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,320
and that applies to not just you know

724
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,840
your privilege you know you can when

725
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,600
you're looking at things like

726
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,320
patch management patch management's easy

727
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,679
if you've got a small fleet of endpoints

728
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,039
but when you're talking

729
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,679
hundreds and thousands of endpoints

730
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,520
where do you do your patch management

731
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,960
understanding just because it's a

732
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,880
critical patch

733
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,600
understanding well if i don't apply this

734
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,880
patch

735
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,960
how can i be compromised how hard is it

736
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,000
to be compromised

737
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,400
and if that patch is compromised well

738
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,679
what can i do once they've compromised

739
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,120
it can they move laterally

740
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,200
if they can move laterally what service

741
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,280
can they con service can they get

742
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
and then you can start going well i

743
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
understand this attack path right now

744
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,559
these are the servers that i will

745
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,880
actually patch first the other rest of

746
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,520
the fleet

747
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,600
minimal risk doesn't matter we'll patch

748
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,960
those on a

749
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
tight skirt not such a tight schedule

750
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,320
and then that way it actually allows you

751
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,080
to get in front of your patch management

752
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,159
again all about understanding your risk

753
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,240
reducing that risk pathway

754
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,360
um to enable you to actually be able to

755
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,320
detect and respond

756
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,640
be react don't be reactive be proactive

757
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,559
is what is the message there really

758
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,000
so um so with that i just if anyone got

759
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,840
any questions

760
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,320
do we have any we certainly do um

761
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,520
so we've got simon asks how often should

762
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,480
an organization

763
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,720
undergo your type of ad assessments

764
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,640
the type of reporting we actually talk

765
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,320
about here

766
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,679
you know they take minutes to run

767
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,600
you could do them once a week in fact

768
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,919
the the bulk of the work for any sort of

769
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,120
clean up

770
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,640
you know once you get the bulk of the

771
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,120
work done and then you move on to that

772
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,720
monitor and protect

773
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,159
you shouldn't see those conditions

774
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,640
reappear you're protecting those objects

775
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,520
you're preventing

776
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
those types of changes from occurring

777
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,200
again

778
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,120
you're preventing weak passwords to be

779
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,440
set so you won't have any passwords

780
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
so typically when we actually set these

781
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,039
things up we run these reports once a

782
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,559
week

783
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,840
once a week any changes no you know once

784
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,520
you've done the remediation

785
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,880
those reports should be looking pretty

786
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,039
blank fair enough

787
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,279
another question here from scott how

788
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,240
many companies

789
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,760
actually implement red forest approach

790
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,600
in my experience i have

791
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,799
seen two one still in trying to do it

792
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,159
and one didn't actually do true red

793
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,480
forest they just did segmentation of

794
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,000
active directory

795
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,320
and was it effective no it was too hard

796
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
for them to maintain

797
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,000
when we used to talk to them about okay

798
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,440
so what you're actually doing to put

799
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,640
those controls in is

800
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,000
the first thing that you could hear it's

801
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,240
a big sign saying it's an administrative

802
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,880
nightmare

803
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,159
and it's a financial headache so that's

804
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,279
where

805
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,760
um where microsoft themselves have now

806
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,200
changed shift and said you know

807
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,880
that zero standard privilege is the best

808
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,240
approach you know

809
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,360
it's it's actually a lot easier to

810
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,080
achieve

811
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,240
than most people think if you have a

812
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,559
right pam solution for one

813
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,880
they can actually give that just in time

814
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,679
access

815
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,279
and then remove that privilege at rest

816
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,679
and you've done that id hygiene you

817
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,120
clean up then you're actually

818
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,640
your security posture is going to be

819
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,159
greatly greatly

820
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,200
increased fair enough where's the

821
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,279
majority of the cost

822
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,520
in you know you come in you see the

823
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,320
state it is

824
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,400
is the majority in the cleaner or is it

825
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,799
in the licensing to run this

826
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,159
over time the licensing

827
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,039
yeah so the licensing is actually not

828
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:33,440
that

829
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,480
expensive when you consider what would

830
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,559
happen if you're breached

831
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,440
um i think that recent ransomware attack

832
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,159
saying like

833
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,960
75 bitcoins have five million dollars

834
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,039
you're not spending five million dollars

835
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,360
software licensing to actually do the

836
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,840
right thing

837
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,279
so operationally

838
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,200
i think that first three to six months

839
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,159
to actually

840
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,559
go through change control understand

841
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,919
what you've got going on

842
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,080
um and do the cleanup but once you've

843
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,919
got there the cost of running the actual

844
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,360
software itself once everything's in

845
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,159
place

846
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,679
you know you might have to you might

847
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,279
have initial outlay for professional

848
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,480
services or something like that to

849
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,640
actually get you into a

850
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,000
point where it's configured and you're

851
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,399
ready to go and it's just minor tweaks

852
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,240
operationally then that operational cost

853
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,960
drops obviously you then have the

854
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,000
reduction in infrastructure required

855
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,600
and yeah i don't know um just one that i

856
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,240
thought of

857
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,960
what would be the way you would sell

858
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,600
this

859
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,000
and very simplistically up to sort of

860
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
board level what are the

861
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,279
what's the key risk or two that you're

862
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,600
really mitigating at that

863
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,120
so in my experience um i've been sitting

864
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,720
with sale guys for three days so

865
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,559
i've got a green glow you understand why

866
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,080
um

867
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,320
my experience is present an executive

868
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,399
report of

869
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,520
high low medium risk we'll do

870
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,720
we can go in and actually run a

871
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,000
different sets of jobs from these

872
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,520
reports and actually give you an

873
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,039
executive summary ago this is your

874
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,679
top ten risk and then we you can

875
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,600
actually associate um a financial

876
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,960
implication to those risks

877
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,480
whether it be compliance um

878
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,720
whether it be what would be the cost if

879
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,919
you were breached

880
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,520
um what's the cost of your reputation

881
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,760
and that dependent on the industry so

882
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,799
reputation within the industry

883
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,679
especially when you're

884
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,840
dealing with customer information is

885
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,200
everything you can't pull price on that

886
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,679
have an anonymous question here which is

887
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,760
what additional value can you bring if

888
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,360
we already have an ad

889
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,880
audit plus well we can come in and

890
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,440
actually

891
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,960
review so this really is more of an

892
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,640
agnostic approach this is you know this

893
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,480
is what we're seeing guys if you've got

894
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,799
an auditing platform that gives you this

895
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,399
information already

896
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,000
you know we're happy to come in and

897
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,159
actually review and assist

898
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,159
to say okay this is the areas that you

899
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,760
should be looking at

900
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,679
um do you have that information if you

901
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,039
don't okay this is how you can get that

902
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,520
information

903
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,480
