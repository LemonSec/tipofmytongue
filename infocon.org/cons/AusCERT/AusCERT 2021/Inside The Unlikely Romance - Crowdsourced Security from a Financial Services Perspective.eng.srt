11
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,479

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,159
this

18
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,320
my next speaker needs no introduction

19
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,920
uh so casey is the chairman founder

great

74
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,040
so yeah uh as cynic kind of went through

75
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,239
what we're talking about there's there's

76
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,440
a talk i've done for a while called

77
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,200
inside the unlikely romance it's this

78
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,480
whole idea that like hackers and

79
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,000
organizations playing nice is a little

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,680
bit like dogs and cats

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,000
you know living together um and it's a

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,280
counterintuitive concept of people i

83
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,319
haven't really thought it through so

84
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,000
i've got a talk that basically

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,480
sets that up this is with the bent of of

86
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,159
you know the more conservative

87
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,360
industries that are out there so

88
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,319
financial services

89
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,080
is one example i'll go through some of

90
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,760
the others uh in in a little bit but

91
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,400
that's kind of the

92
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
the idea of it because i think our model

93
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,680
it was

94
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,920
kicked off from silicon valley it's

95
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,839
known as this kind of crazy tech company

96
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,959
thing to do

97
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,320
a lot's happened since then so i'm going

98
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
to unpack some of that

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,440
who am i so i started off in a college

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,280
shirt this morning i've like i'm slowly

101
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,040
morphing back into the

102
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
the you know my hoodies in the dry

103
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,680
cleaners is the joke i put out on

104
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
twitter this morning

105
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,479
um but there is the you know the hack

106
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,160
persona and the hustle persona

107
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,479
as a company leader as a board leader

108
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,840
all of those different things that's the

109
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,880
business guy

110
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,639
and very much a technologist um that was

111
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,320
my origin that's still what i try to get

112
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,520
back to i think the older i get the

113
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,639
better i was but

114
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,840
i still give it a good shot right um

115
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
and really that's i think the uh the

116
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
introductions kind of set everything um

117
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
the one bit is lives in san francisco

118
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,440
lives in i

119
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,479
don't really know um we actually um

120
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,639

121

123
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,840

124
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,280

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,160
how we got here like what's the progress

154
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,680
of this industry how do we get here

155
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,120
especially with respect to financial

156
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,000
services and

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,360
you know the kind of organizations that

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,720
you wouldn't necessarily expect to be

159
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
running a bug bounty program

160
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,880
or do any kind of crowdsourcing or

161
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,360
multi-sourcing like

162
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,440
what's the journey of that looked like a

163
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,639
couple of war stories

164
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,160
um kind of my broke versus woke

165
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
hot take section in terms of how

166
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,000
thinking about all of this stuff

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,840
has progressed and some ideas about how

168
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,360
to go forward and then q a

169
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,080
on the q a side i love being able to

170
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,759
hear what y'all have in mind that you're

171
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,800
wanting to learn

172
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,039
so you know make use of the the app you

173
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,240
know we can do just

174
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,520
random yelling at the end of this

175
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,759
session as well um alright

176
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,680
so we're good to go yeah browsing

177
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,080
come on people wake up i know it's just

178
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,000
after lunch but it's all good

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,800
uh okay so when you know as i mentioned

180
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,560
when we first started the concept of

181
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,319
crowdsourcing the concept of

182
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,160
you know hackers as a help not just a

183
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,360
harm

184
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,199
really was birthed out of the technology

185
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,360
industry when we started bug crowd one

186
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,160
of the first things

187
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,759
i wanted to do was to basically have a

188
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,919
jump out of the sandpit right um

189
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,440
silicon valley is interesting the it's

190
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,120
kind of the lunatics validating this

191
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,960
the asylum in a lot of ways you've got

192
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,560
all these early adopters that are doing

193
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
stuff and then selling it to themselves

194
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
and that's good because it's usually how

195
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,759
things are going to look in the future

196
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,240
but until you break it out of that space

197
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,759
and make it relevant to

198
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,120
you know industries that are more

199
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,360
ubiquitous you haven't really in my mind

200
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,280
proven your concept until that point so

201
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,800
we set out to do that

202
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,680
um so let's go after the oldest

203
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,240
financial services

204
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,319
organization you know pretty much in in

205
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,840
the planet the joke was at the time that

206
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,960
western union

207
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,440
is is probably older than america itself

208
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,080
um

209
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,639
which could be true might not be uh but

210
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,080
it was one of these organizations where

211
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,360
if you looked at them doing this type of

212
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,880
thing it's like ah that's interesting i

213
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,000
thought that was just a facebook

214
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,639
thing now they're doing it i'm i'm

215
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,360
intrigued

216
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,160
um the introduction to them was really

217
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,199
actually through

218
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,639
we started to talk to them about the

219
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,240
whole model um what they actually had

220
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,639
was

221
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,440
literally a distort an extortion uh

222
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
attempt so someone had a vulnerability

223
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,479
this is not like

224
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,160
big bounty or people doing that sort of

225
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,680
thing it was straight up flat out

226
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,400
extortion like um pay us money otherwise

227
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,840
we're going to exploit this phone drop

228
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,960
it on the internet all that sort of

229
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,919
thing

230
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,759
so they called us saying well you speak

231
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,280
hakka like how do we

232
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,840
how do we do this um we basically helped

233
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,360
them out of that situation

234
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,800
they then went on to start a private

235
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,720
program and in march 2015 they became

236
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,360
the first

237
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,440
publicly traded financial services

238
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,960
company with a with a public bug bounty

239
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,599
program um which was pretty great like

240
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,199
at that point in time that was a

241
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,280
revolutionary idea that an organization

242
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,880
like that would even entertain this idea

243
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,159
in the first place and i think it helped

244
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,719
the whole

245
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,000
help bug crowd along but i think it

246
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,440
helped the whole model and the whole

247
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,399
industry along the same time so fast

248
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,000
forward to today

249
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
uh really financial services is a

250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
substantial chunk

251
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,519
of our business it's a substantial chunk

252
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,040
of you know the people that are going

253
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,440
out

254
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,760
and and working out their own ways bit

255
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,360
through vol disclosure through whatever

256
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,000
else finding

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,320
ways to basically engage the help that's

258
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
outside the force of their organization

259
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
to help them stay safe

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,680
i you know one of the things that we saw

261
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,839
last year was that covert drove

262
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,320
huge acceleration for us in this market

263
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,120
as a business

264
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,560
um primarily because of the bricks and

265
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,240
mortar aspect that kind of went away

266
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,440
so you had all these like digital

267
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
transformation projects that were

268
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
planned for 2022 that

269
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,040
rule of sudden plan for june how do you

270
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
secure that stuff like we can scale into

271
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,959
that so they they definitely

272
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,000
picked up the pace there um i think with

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
this whole model and for us you know we

274
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
often find ourselves at the top

275
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,160
of a cso's roi stack ranking um and this

276
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,279
is something that we actually try to go

277
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,480
out and do objectively

278
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
so much so that the the cso of nab just

279
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,000
joined us over the past

280
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,640
past couple of months so nab's been a

281
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,399
customer they were an early adopter

282
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,320
in in the australian market in fincerve

283
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,399
as well started privately and then

284
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,080
worked their way out to more public and

285
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,519
more exposed programs at this point

286
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,240
they're doing

287
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,000
pretty much everything that we do in

288
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,360
some form or fashion

289
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
um nick saw that and thought okay this

290
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,800
is really you know this is going to be

291
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,880
an inevitable part of how we do

292
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,560
at least some aspects of security in the

293
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,080
future i want to be a part of it

294
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,519
so we're pretty stoked to have him

295
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,640
aboard and you know why did he do that

296
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,680
i think it comes back to the

297
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,200
fundamentals of what we're trying to get

298
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,839
done here

299
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,360
like those of you who are in the uh the

300
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,560
panel this morning would have heard me

301
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,200
say i

302
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,959
fundamentally believe cyber security is

303
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,399
a human problem

304
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,800
the tech just makes it go faster right

305
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,160
so we end up in this position

306
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,079
where you can kind of see it here you've

307
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,560
got you know the baddies on one side and

308
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,079
we don't know how many of them there are

309
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,600
what they're capable of why they're

310
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,959
pulling on the rope in the first place

311
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,200
but we know they are there then there's

312
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,959
the computer which is the battleground

313
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,240
and whoever

314
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,480
is employed and usually paid by the hour

315
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,360
to try to

316
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,519
try to fight back the thing of it is

317
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,200
that that person can be

318
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,000
brilliant it's actually the math that's

319
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,079
the problem it's the idea that

320
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,839
you know there's an imbalance of forces

321
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,279
there's an imbalance of resourcing and

322
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,880
creativity that can be applied

323
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,160
and meanwhile you've got the white hat

324
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,920
community standing around

325
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,360
you know those of you who are from the

326
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
hacker space like we've been

327
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,000
trying to help for the last 30 odd years

328
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,720
um

329
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
we've never really gotten a seat at the

330
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,200
table until the last 10 or so so that's

331
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,880
that's really you know i think something

332
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
that i'm quite

333
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,720
chuffed about with this whole thing and

334
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,760
how it's all progressed

335
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
really this is why people like nick at

336
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,880
this point in time looking at it saying

337
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,399
that's actually the future

338
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,920
because honestly like we're not going to

339
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,360
solve all this with automation we're not

340
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,160
going to solve it

341
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,600
all of this with the people that we hire

342
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,279
regardless of how smart we are we need

343
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,640
to level the playing field right

344
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,399
and really you know i think the other

345
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,160
thing that's happening uh alongside

346
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,079
that is is the cso the actual role of

347
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,000
the csos in the process still

348
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,880
of being defined um i see this all

349
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,519
around the world

350
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,519
um definitely in australia it's also

351
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,680
true in the us uh in in other parts of

352
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,800
the world where okay

353
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,320
we've got the security person in the

354
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,959
boardroom now we don't really know why

355
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:45,680
they're here

356
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,600
other than the fact that they should be

357
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,200
they're still trying to figure out how

358
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
to be here and how to interface with the

359
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,160
rest of the business

360
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,440
um you know what's up here and that's

361
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,079
starting to be

362
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,320
formed right the way i see it is this

363
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,920
almost this balancing act three-way

364
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,120
balancing act between

365
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,040
the business and financial side the

366
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,959
political side which includes marketing

367
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,720
like internally and externally

368
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,160
and then this technical side and

369
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,320
oftentimes you get two out of the three

370
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,519
finding all three in the one person is

371
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,120
kind of hard right and that's just the

372
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,920
human thing

373
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
um so often times you get two out of the

374
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,680
three often times there's technical

375
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,079
basically debt in in the ability to

376
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,519
actually answer these questions and

377
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,720
guide the business

378
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,240
and again it's not the fault of the

379
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,600
people that are involved it's just a

380
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,120
hard problem to solve so how do we

381
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,959
backfill that

382
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,160
something that we spend a lot of time

383
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,079
talking about um

384
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,079
and educating on within bug crowd is is

385
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,519
you know what's the hacker's response to

386
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,320
that

387
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,279
because in this space you've got this

388
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,800
very broad variety of

389
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,639
of degrees of professionalism people

390
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,000
even understanding what that means in

391
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
the first place

392
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,760
um and you know there's education

393
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,320
involved

394
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,760
you know rookies who come in like what

395
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,120
does it look like to wear a suit and tie

396
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,240
to work sometimes

397
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,440
because you don't have to do that but

398
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,040
understanding that that's a thing is is

399
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,680
going to help you

400
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,800
it's going to be you know pretty

401
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
important and useful in your career so

402
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,680
the whole idea of

403
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,279
you switch between these two you've got

404
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,440
those kind of three sections for the cso

405
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
and then the corresponding sides

406
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,800
to the community that's a big part of

407
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,279
what we've been trying to educate the uh

408
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,959
and seeing honestly at this point in

409
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,720
time the hacker community actually have

410
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
a growing appetite for so if you go out

411
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,360
and look at the content that's being

412
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,160
generated

413
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,320
half of it's on how to build a career um

414
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,279
and how to

415
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,760
how to speak suit literally which is i

416
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,279
think a really really good thing

417
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,360
um the tech stuff's already there like

418
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,959
if people are in this space in the first

419
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,079
place they're gonna figure that stuff

420
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,959
out themselves

421
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,320
this is the hard bit that they probably

422
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
don't intuitively understand so

423
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,839
the fact that that's there's gravity in

424
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,040
that direction i think is a really good

425
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,639
thing

426
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,880
so when we've gone out and talked to

427
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,000
these industries

428
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,320
um you know financial services has won

429
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,440
we've done work

430
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,560
we've been working with the department

431
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,959
of defense in the u.s for the last

432
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,839
six or seven years at this point um

433
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,440
other sort of similar verticals where

434
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,160
you've

435
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,320
you know again you're like if facebook's

436
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,920
up one end these these folk are at the

437
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,839
other end of that spectrum right

438
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,440
and ask them like what's the problems

439
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,680
that you've got um that we can

440
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,120
potentially help solve these are the

441
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,639
three that have come back most reliably

442
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,399
like can't find the right people to do

443
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,560
the work i've got tooling that's

444
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,399
fragmented and it's inadequate if you're

445
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,760
talking about having it compete

446
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,959
creatively with the

447
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,839
adversary and my workflows are kind of

448
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,760
disjointed right

449
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,440
so really what we did as an organization

450
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,279
is build a platform to plug everything

451
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:21,839
in

452
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,680
so the idea behind bug crowd was really

453
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,440
the latent potential that exists in the

454
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,639
white house community

455
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,040
and then this growing problem of cyber

456
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,160
just in general

457
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,839
how do we plug that in uh because that

458
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,199
seems like a logical thing to do that's

459
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,240
really what we've been doing

460
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,880
now for the last 10 years simple right

461
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,000
there's a fair bit of devil in the

462
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
detail but that's the supernatural soup

463
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,320
the nuts of it

464
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,920
in terms of the priorities that we're

465
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,480
trying to help organizations solve what

466
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,040
we've heard them come to us with so this

467
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,240
is not again i'm

468
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,320
stressing this because it's not like bug

469
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,760
crowds marketing like we want to tell

470
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,959
the market how you're thinking

471
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,279
thing this is actually off you know

472
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,000
studies that we've

473
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,399
done like research like actually trying

474
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,079
to dig into like what is most important

475
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,519
because there's so many things we can

476
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,240
solve

477
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,839
like stack rank that stuff and tell us

478
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,360
how we can best help

479
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,800
and these were things these were the

480
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,160
things that came up you know risk

481
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,040
reduction

482
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
is fairly obvious it's not always a

483
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,120
given um but it's it's high on the list

484
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,040
improving time to market so you know

485
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,720
having security be as

486
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,800
minimal a blocker to getting new things

487
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,240
out to market as possible and that's

488
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
part of what we saw in 2020

489
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,760
with all this transformation stuff we

490
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,120
could scales to that because the

491
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,240
community's there

492
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
at the doorstep it doesn't it gives them

493
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,600
the feedback they need without slowing

494
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,279
them down that's really important

495
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,839
um improving the roi which is critical

496
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,279
because you know security is one of

497
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,639
those things where if it works nothing

498
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,360
happens

499
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,199
so this the scrutiny on budget and on

500
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,279
money that's being spent i think is

501
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,959
it's always a thing but i think in our

502
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,279
space the burden of proof on that is

503
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,320
even higher so

504
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,000
that's a that's a big one and then

505
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,160
contextual visibility like how do i

506
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,800
you know view a particular data point or

507
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,639
a particular piece of input in light of

508
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,360
my

509
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,680
overall attack surface my overall you

510
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,639
know threat model

511
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,000
like the risks i'm dealing with the

512
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,639
assets that i have to protect

513
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,320
so really kind of where we've gone from

514
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,000
here is from

515
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
our origins which was really talking

516
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,360
about bug bounty crowd source pen

517
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
testing those sorts of things is to

518
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,000
diversify out

519
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,320
how we deliver that um so bug bounties

520
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,160
in the in the traditional sense

521
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,839
vulnerability disclosure programs which

522
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,480
i'm an absolute nutter for like you'll

523
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,839
if you come up ask for a sticker or

524
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,759
whatever else later you'll pick that up

525
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,600
pretty quickly because i believe that

526
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,199
it's almost an issue of core corporate

527
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,440
responsibility to have a way to receive

528
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,880
security feedback from the internet it's

529
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,399
becoming like neighborhood watch right

530
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,000
and it went from being this novel idea

531
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,560
to a thing that just should be a thing

532
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,120
um

533
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,399
pen testing which is the one that

534
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,000
surprises folk that's actually where we

535
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,639
started

536
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,959
as an organization but we've gone into

537
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,240
you know different ways of delivering

538
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,839
that like crowd sourcing it obviously

539
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,440
moving into outsourcing different things

540
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,160
as well to

541
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,839
be able to deliver deliver that in ways

542
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,519
that are more traditional to the user

543
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,040
and to be able to satisfy questions

544
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,199
around assurance and and so on

545
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,880
uh and then attack surface management

546
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,399
which i think is a really interesting

547
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:00,800
one

548
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,040
um i think the asset note folk are doing

549
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,559
a talk uh

550
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,880
here somewhere and and i'll say this i'm

551
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,400
not speaking out of school on this one

552
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
you know they got their origin or their

553
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,760
kind of start

554
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
from basically operating in a bug bounty

555
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,119
model and realizing people don't know

556
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,319
where their crap is

557
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,480
um here we are like we've you know all

558
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,000
of a sudden the entire internet is

559
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,760
potentially our attack surface and our

560
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,640
burden is to prove

561
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,199
that thing over there is not mine how do

562
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,720
i do that at scale that seems like an

563
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,000
impossible problem

564
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,840
uh so there's all sorts of stuff around

565
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,520
that what we do is augment that

566
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
with with researchers that are focused

567
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,520
particularly on that that task

568
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,039
um and just in terms of you know where

569
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,200
we're up to this is like the yay slide

570
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,320
uh 200 employees 80 million raised 170

571
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,640
000 or so vulnerabilities annihilated 50

572
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,200
million paid out about 200 000 signed up

573
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,280
on the platform uh of which about

574
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,360
10 to 15 are actually active at any

575
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,640
given point in time

576
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,240
uh and thousands of programs of all

577
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
sorts of sorts of different uh shapes

578
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,640
and

579
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,200
sizes so i'm going to pause myself for a

580
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,760
sec for some water

581
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,600
i'm feeling the speed up as i go along

582
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,840
so yeah take a take a deliberate

583
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,399
shift here

584
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,080
so what does this look like on the

585
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,520
receiving end

586
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,120
with a focus on conservative markets

587
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,240
right this is the war story section and

588
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,679
it kind of introduces a concept that

589
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,960
i've started to use a little bit the

590
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,280
idea of like research driven assurance

591
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,200
like when you think about traditional

592
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,960
assurance it's usually built on

593
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,640
top of what people already know there's

594
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
folks that add research to that

595
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,240
um but for the better part that's not

596
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,160
the norm it's it's kind of the

597
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,559
the exception to the norm uh for this

598
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,280
model

599
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,960
you know we're deliberately drawing from

600
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,559
people that have focused on research is

601
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,080
how they do security assurance so what

602
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,559
happens when you plug that in

603
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,240
um this one was fun so aka the equifax

604
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,360
vulnerability it'll probably

605
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
be forever known as that and struts2

606
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,559
probably known as the thing that got

607
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,880
equifax owned um

608
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,160
which is just the way it is because it

609
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,919
was kind of a bad hack

610
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,640
um so an organization that we were

611
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,840
working with

612
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,799
they'd gone through and fixed struts to

613
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,039
and

614
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,640
and they thought they got it all dialed

615
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,840
in they'd missed a bunch of stuff

616
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,880
so equifax itself was announced

617
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,080
in july 2017 the compromise took place

618
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,840
in may of 2017

619
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,200
we basically went out and found this

620
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,039
stuff and told them about it in february

621
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,520
so we closed off that window in in terms

622
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,720
of organizations or

623
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,320
adversaries that were looking for this

624
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,840
particular

625
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,440
exploit as a way to get in and do bad

626
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,559
stuff to financial services

627
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,679
organizations we

628
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,280
closed that window for them by three

629
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,440
months which was pretty cool

630
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
that was one of the ones that was around

631
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,240
the time when we were bringing a whole

632
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,520
bunch of new people

633
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,200
actually into the into bug crowd from a

634
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,960
hiring standpoint

635
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,600
and it was like whoa okay that was good

636
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,880
like it was an internal proof point for

637
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,120
the organization as much as it was for

638
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,640
for everyone else who's watching on um

639
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,400
another like last year was a pretty

640
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,520
interesting year i think

641
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,280
there was a combination of increased

642
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,039
focus from an adversarial research

643
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,080
standpoint and i think

644
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,520
increased use of basically

645
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,760
you know vulnerabilities in in public

646
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,679
access and remote access systems so

647
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,720
pulse

648
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,120
um f5 to mui is the one i'm going to

649
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,480
talk about here there was a whole raft

650
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,919
of others there was actually an nsa

651
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,360
advisory that came out

652
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,039
i think in november that talked about

653
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,799
end day um

654
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,640
in use by nation state actors like why

655
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,240
are they doing it it's because it still

656
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,960
works

657
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,880
like why would you burn you know a half

658
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,320
million dollar capability when you can

659
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
download something of exploitdb

660
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,720
and still get the job done and that was

661
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,440
a thing

662
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,760
last year and continues to be so today

663
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
so with this particular one

664
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,280
what we saw was uh

665
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,440
the advisory so this was actually end

666
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,200
day in terms of what we saw come out of

667
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,799
the crowd the patch came first

668
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,640
then the patch got reversed we saw it

669
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,720
come through the platform

670
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,960
used in anger in the context of research

671
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,120
driven assurance

672
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,640
i think it was two days or three days

673
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,880
before exploit db and some of those

674
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,480
other places started publishing

675
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,559
uh proof of concepts so like that's

676
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,240
another example where there's this drift

677
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,679
and you can sort of see

678
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,000
how the model kind of draws out what

679
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,840
what people are able to do

680
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,200
but then gets that information to the

681
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,480
right place which is the place where it

682
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,200
can be actioned right

683
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,120
this one was fun it's a you know this is

684
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,720
i put this in the innovative technique

685
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,360
bucket

686
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,159
um so the idea of a type confusion um

687
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,559
that was earlier this year

688
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,640
we've actually seen that attack in the

689
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,280
wild since december or so of 2020.

690
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,520
um like variations of that got coalesced

691
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,720
written up into a paper and all of a

692
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,159
sudden everyone's talking about it and i

693
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,840
actually think this particular

694
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,520
this particular attack mode we haven't

695
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,120
seen the end of it um

696
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,280
because it really kind of leans quite

697
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,039
heavily on some of the assumptions

698
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,640
that we have on supply chain security

699
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,559
which you know apparently this year is

700
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,720
the year of the supply chain attack so

701
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,280
that's a that's a consistent theme um

702
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,840
again

703
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,559
you know this research driven approach

704
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,760
to assurance

705
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,520
found this stuff before it became widely

706
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,840
known and therefore broadly exploitable

707
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,120
and it continues forward you know today

708
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,320
we actually saw this happen in in

709
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,159
organizations that were able to take

710
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,760
that information fix the

711
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
like discrete issues that were pointed

712
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,200
out so you've got a problem with your

713
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,640
mpm or your

714
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,120
you know your gems or whatever else

715
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,039
basically apply that concept across

716
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,559
all the different areas where that same

717
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,720
type of issue might occur

718
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,960
and like proactively defend against this

719
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,080
type of attack which was pretty cool

720
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,360
this is a fun one this was actually

721
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,080
really early in in in buck grad we had a

722
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,320
alexa top 100 vinserv organization

723
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,640
um they've been around on the internet

724
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,320
for probably 20 years or more that the

725
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,240
particular site that got owned

726
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,440
um and what it was was an xxe

727
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,919
uh that could get pivoted across to ssrf

728
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,000
then got rc in the back end server

729
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,280
farm at which point stop

730
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,400
um and and you know the person

731
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,679
doing that and finding that and

732
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,320
reporting it paused at that point but

733
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,640
the

734
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,000
the degree of privilege they actually

735
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,760
had within that environment

736
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,120
and the things that you could do from

737
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,600
there was pretty you know dramatic and

738
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,080
pretty

739
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,159
pretty extreme it was a good bug they

740
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,000
got paid well for it

741
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,600
we like those it's like yeah that one's

742
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,080
really cool um

743
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,159
you know the thing is that that bug we

744
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,360
found out later

745
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,080
had probably been in play for about five

746
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,960
years

747
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,280
um they were able to go back to ir burn

748
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,440
down see if there was any you know iocs

749
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,000
created

750
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,760
through the skill train that like mapped

751
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,520
out other things that other people have

752
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,240
done

753
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,840
found that it hadn't to their knowledge

754
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,000
been exploited um but it had been there

755
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,679
exposed for about five years at

756
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,679
that point and the thing is that this

757
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,720
this is like

758
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
alexa top 100 it's in the top 100

759
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,200
websites on the internet gets pen tested

760
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
twice a year that had been going on for

761
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,039
15 years and this got missed

762
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,039
so that was a really interesting example

763
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,400
of you know when you've got that

764
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,000
curiosity in that drive and you've got

765
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,919
the kind of skills being brought to bear

766
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,440
to do this type of thing like what

767
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,679
actually pops out the other end

768
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,279
i think this is a really interesting one

769
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,960
as well so

770
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,799
um we actually we got involved

771
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,320
in the uh dod hack the pentagon program

772
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,000
early on in the piece doing mostly

773
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,520
private works there's the public side of

774
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,799
that everyone knows about

775
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,159
the part people don't talk about as

776
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,640
often as the private crowdsourcing piece

777
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,159
so with this we're actually doing source

778
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,000
code analysis which is like

779
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,640
wait what you could do that um yeah we

780
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,120
did

781
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,520
um you know environment testing azure

782
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,320
testing

783
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,080
crowdsource social engineering which was

784
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,200
really interesting i thought it was

785
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,400
quite brave

786
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,159
of the dod to try that because it was

787
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,679
definitely experimental it's something

788
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,200
that we've evolved since but it was

789
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,960
it worked it was really effective this

790
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,880
is a environment it was pre-production

791
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,200
but it was intended to be tssci

792
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,799
as a compartment so the fact that we

793
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,080
were bouncing around on the inside of

794
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,960
the thing i think is

795
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,080
is pretty amazing um 54 volumes 123

796
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,960
grand in rewards

797
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,039
top reward for that one was 20 grand

798
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,720
there was a lot of stuff that fell out

799
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,000
it was already as you can imagine a

800
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,559
fairly resilient environment because the

801
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,400
air force are good at that kind of thing

802
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
but there was still a lot that was found

803
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,919
and to me this is a proof point of the

804
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,120
fact that yeah

805
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,279
industries and and conservative

806
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,279
organizations conservative verticals are

807
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,240
starting to trust

808
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
hackers starting to trust security

809
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,000
researchers more

810
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,760
that ultimately is a good thing i think

811
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,679
it's obviously great for bug crowd as a

812
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,200
business i think it's just a globally

813
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,400
good thing to see happen

814
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,679
so there you go how am i going on time

815
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,960
all right so um and remember questions

816
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,799
store them up let's let's have a chat at

817
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,240
the end here this is my bro

818
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,919
first work i think the thing that's been

819
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,840
interesting about this space

820
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,520
is that when you say bug bounty

821
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,279
everyone's got an opinion they've got a

822
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,799
particular like

823
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,880
mode of what it looks like in their head

824
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,480
they've got a particular opinion of

825
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,799
what it's valuable for how it works and

826
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,400
there's varying degrees of accuracy and

827
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,679
truth in that i'm not

828
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,440
here to say that my point of view is the

829
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,120
right one um

830
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,720
but that is to say that like you know

831
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,159
words are hard in cyber security in

832
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,200
general i think

833
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,480
and just trying to kind of paint out

834
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,240
some misconceptions and talk about

835
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,520
different ways of thinking about stuff

836
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,279
as we go forward and this is cyber

837
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,240
security

838
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,720
as a space but then particularly around

839
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,159
research driven uh

840
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,360
assurance so broke this is more of an

841
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,039
industry one rub some blockchain on it

842
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,480
and it'll go away like we talked all

843
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,520
about this this morning

844
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,320
um in the uh in the panel you know the

845
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,520
idea is that like

846
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,880
cyber security is actually a people

847
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,480
problem uh the tech just makes it go

848
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,240
faster i think once

849
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
the industry and particularly executives

850
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,320
that are outside of our space

851
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,240
catch that and actually grow that idea

852
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,600
all of a sudden a whole bunch of things

853
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,720
get easier

854
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,960
you end up fighting less against the you

855
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,640
know the idea of the blinky box in the

856
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,440
corner

857
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,559
solving all your problems you can

858
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,240
actually approach things through a risk

859
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,799
lens

860
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,158
and start to solve real problems

861
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,240
bro vulnerability discussion programs as

862
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,159
a marketing stunt um this is

863
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,640
this is something that still happens um

864
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,320
we definitely saw it a lot early on so

865
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,360
people going out and saying i want to

866
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,480
get in techcrunch i'm going to start a

867
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,360
vdp

868
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,799
and that was really the only reason they

869
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,080
were doing it i do think that the

870
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,760
marketing benefit

871
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,600
and the statement of transparency around

872
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,120
the vulnerability disclosure program is

873
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,159
a powerful thing

874
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,919
um we actually did a lot of work with

875
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,600
the eac and the department of homeland

876
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,440
security in the us ahead of the 2020

877
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,880
election

878
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,600
to use vdp to basically not only find

879
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,279
vulnerabilities in election systems but

880
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,000
try to

881
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,520
bolster confidence in the voting

882
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,120
population that turned out to be

883
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,679
pretty important and um i don't feel

884
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,960
like we solved that problem but we

885
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,480
definitely moved the needle and actually

886
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,880
you know it got adopted which i thought

887
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,480
was phenomenal um

888
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,960
really you know this is this is where i

889
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,120
think the the true power of a vdp

890
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,279
stands out it's this idea of like to er

891
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,159
is human

892
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,159
um it's almost like an antidote for

893
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,679
ostrich risk management

894
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,360
within an organization right where it's

895
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,039
like oh if we just pretend this thing

896
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,279
doesn't exist um all of a sudden it

897
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,120
won't be a problem for us

898
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,200
that's becoming increasingly obvious as

899
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,799
something that isn't true

900
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,120
um and this drives that point home okay

901
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,559
cool like we're admitting

902
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,480
that we're not perfect turns out all

903
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,600
humans are like that so

904
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,279
that's not actually a huge stretch it's

905
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,279
just businesses struggle with that leap

906
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,279
right this is a vehicle for that i think

907
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,640
it's another powerful idea

908
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,960
broke literally bug benny is a silver

909
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,159
bullet uh the idea

910
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,880
of basically you know going out katie

911
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,159
mazuris

912
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,080
and i can get into tangles on on

913
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,240
different kind of aspects of detail

914
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,679
this is a particular point that we're in

915
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,360
violent agreement about

916
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
um because a lot of people go out and

917
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,960
say cool we've rubbed bounty on it and

918
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,000
now it's fine

919
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
that's not true like you've got to do

920
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,600
something with what people tell you

921
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,840
um yeah we have organizations come to us

922
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,279
and say i want to start a bug bounty

923
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:39,919
tomorrow

924
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,240
usually the answer will be no you don't

925
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,039
um

926
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,559
let's put the brakes on for a second

927
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,159
like what else are you doing

928
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,480
for you to suddenly wake up the next day

929
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,600
and go out and offer money to the

930
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,120
internet for hacking your stuff like you

931
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,559
have to be ready for that

932
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,320
so like let's have that conversation

933
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,840
first right you'd be amazed how often

934
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,880
that happens

935
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,480
bug bounty is a way to you know the work

936
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,760
version is bug bounty is a way for the

937
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,360
business to internalize the boogeyman's

938
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,720
reel

939
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,840
there's something profoundly impactful

940
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,159
uh for an engineer for a non-security

941
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,039
person

942
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,360
about getting your code hacked by some

943
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,399
random kid

944
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,000
halfway across the world it's different

945
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,440
to when your red team does it

946
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,360
because all of a sudden it's like ah

947
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,559
they're helpful

948
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,159
and friendly and all that i wonder what

949
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,840
their next door neighbor's like oh my

950
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,440
god this is possible

951
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,919
um i think a lot of the time that

952
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,360
internalization and that kind of

953
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,880
baseline awareness of the fact that it

954
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,080
does matter

955
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,559
um you know we could clean up a lot of

956
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,240
stuff if we just had that to work with

957
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,919
universally within an organization i

958
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,039
think this is a really

959
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,240
powerful way to help achieve that again

960
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,760
broke literally uh

961
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,159
total payouts is a vanity metric you see

962
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,520
organizations going out and saying we

963
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,240
paid out

964
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,480
you know 100 million dollars in the last

965
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,760
quarter it's like

966
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,919
are you fixing stuff are you like

967
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,440
actually getting better at not

968
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,960
introducing vulnerabilities in the first

969
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,440
place

970
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,039
i think there is a legitimate use case

971
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,799
for it and there's some organizations

972
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,159
a small number that do this well um but

973
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,399
like to hold this up as the goal that

974
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,760
everyone should aspire to

975
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,279
for starters it's not economically

976
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,960
rational for most organizations for

977
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,480
seconds it kind of reinforces the wrong

978
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,919
thing

979
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,760
so the work version is is required

980
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
payout as a proxy

981
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,159
for the cost to attack the company we've

982
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,120
seen actually

983
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,440
organizations in australia take this on

984
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,200
it's almost like the fireproof safe

985
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,360
right like if you eat a fireproof safe

986
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,039
into the sun it's gonna burn it's not

987
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,320
actually fireproof

988
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,399
um so what you've got on the box is you

989
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,000
know your passport's gonna survive for

990
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,919
six hours at this temperature

991
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,279
and that's how fire resistant it is

992
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,159
so transport that across to this we had

993
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:40,559
uh

994
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,960
uh you know as an organization we had a

995
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,840
payout of

996
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,919
ten thousand dollars we saw a bunch a

997
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,279
bunch of bugs come through then it

998
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,720
started to calm down

999
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,200
and then we increased it to 20 000 then

1000
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,960
that started to calm down

1001
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,559
all of a sudden you've got this

1002
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,080
basically trend line that you can show

1003
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,799
to a board

1004
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,799
because they understand dollar signs

1005
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,480
right um

1006
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,320
that you're improving this is actually a

1007
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,399
cost you know a cost to attack the

1008
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,080
business in a white hat context

1009
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,320
granted but it's still i think a

1010
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,399
holistic metric that's actually quite

1011
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,760
quite powerful and tell us the story of

1012
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,519
why we're all here like fundamentally

1013
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,880
we're here to make it harder for the bad

1014
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,519
guys

1015
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,240
right so all right if you've got data to

1016
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,519
actually support the fact that that's

1017
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,240
working

1018
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,760
that's a pretty powerful thing to to be

1019
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,000
able to use

1020
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,840
um bro pentest is an assurance only

1021
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,159
model uh so

1022
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,000
this is the tick and flick problem right

1023
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,320
i i think the idea of being able to run

1024
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,679
through a list of things and say that

1025
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,480
you did it

1026
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,240
there's a legitimate use case for it i

1027
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,159
prefer it when it's done well

1028
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,919
um we actually now do this um

1029
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,080
and you know bring alongside it

1030
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,679
competitive testing and

1031
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,200
matching and all these different sorts

1032
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,360
of things to be able to maximize our

1033
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,519
ability to identify risk in that process

1034
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,159
um but i think historically pentest for

1035
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,440
the better part we've been able to get

1036
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,600
away with it in the market collectively

1037
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,519
as just something that you know a wizard

1038
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,880
of the dark arts does

1039
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
you get paid a lot of money for and then

1040
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,600
you go flip to another vendor next year

1041
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,880
um i think that's a waste of

1042
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,519
effort frankly like for the better part

1043
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,080
you know

1044
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,840
the work version of that is okay let's

1045
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,919
do assurance but let's also

1046
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,559
optimize for impact i want to know about

1047
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,200
the risks

1048
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,880
that i have that i'm not aware of i want

1049
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
to know the unknown unknowns how do i

1050
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,840
get to those right

1051
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,760
and in doing that you create feedback

1052
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,600
loops between builders and breakers

1053
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,279
so again it's the engineers and the

1054
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,480
people that are deploying the attack

1055
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,000
surface how do you get them

1056
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,760
not becoming as like an offensive

1057
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,039
security expert

1058
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,120
necessarily but just thinking more about

1059
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,080
how it works

1060
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,840
like that's that's a huge lift if you

1061
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,320
can execute on that

1062
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,000
this is a fun one this is a recent

1063
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,559
addition to this list um

1064
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,840
because really solarwinds was

1065
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,480
[Music]

1066
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,760
you know there was uh confirmed activity

1067
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,640
and narratives around a certain fairly

1068
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,080
small set of agencies

1069
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,480
but in reality they got shells on you

1070
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,159
know tens of thousands of different

1071
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,360
organizations

1072
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,120
i think that's a new idea for most folk

1073
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,799
so you've got the you know the

1074
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,039
massage massage threat model james

1075
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,000
mickens from microsoft

1076
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,480
came up with that that's still true but

1077
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,279
here we are

1078
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,679
like noticing changes in the behavior of

1079
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,840
apt that's basically spray and prey

1080
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,320
get shells wherever you can in the hope

1081
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,600
or in the

1082
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,120
you know the model of being flexible

1083
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
enough to use them later that's a new

1084
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,640
thing for us to think about right

1085
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,320
so really what that provokes is this

1086
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,480
idea of how do i detect and contain

1087
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,080
a nation state assuming they're

1088
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,240
successful how do i just directionally

1089
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,480
like assuming that's impossible to fully

1090
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,320
solve but how do i like align with that

1091
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,919
as a north star at least to some degree

1092
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,120
and start moving in that direction

1093
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,080
because that's probably going to be a

1094
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,039
thing at some point

1095
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,240
in the future i think that's a really

1096
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,000
important one and again like a new one

1097
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,159
um and broke you know for all the

1098
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,840
security researchers in the audience

1099
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,360
who've experienced this

1100
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,120
um you know piping uh security at

1101
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
emails or kind of security input that

1102
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,480
comes in from the outside world

1103
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,919
to devnull on the the finder side

1104
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,039
actually trying to help out an

1105
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,559
organization that's not ready for your

1106
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,279
help

1107
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,639
and then having it be a black hole

1108
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,399
that's a really disenchanting experience

1109
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,520
depending on your degree of

1110
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,199
professionalism you know you see some

1111
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,599
people

1112
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,760
actually act out after that happens for

1113
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,960
the better part it's just kind of a

1114
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,440
bomber

1115
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,119
so you know i think there's leverage in

1116
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,440
getting good at this um the work version

1117
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,040
of that is like standardize it let's

1118
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,719
view vdp let's view a relationship

1119
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,239
between organizations

1120
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,440
and people that are trying to give us

1121
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,199
security feedback is just a normal part

1122
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,879
of being on the internet

1123
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,760
um what we've done a group of people

1124
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,800
this is uh

1125
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,320
something i've been involved in for a

1126
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,679
long time um there's you know dhs dod

1127
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,599
like github rapid7 all these different

1128
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,199
organizations that have people

1129
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,760
from them that contribute to this and

1130
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,879
make these things

1131
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,079
more effective over time it's

1132
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,000
standardization of legal language

1133
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,599
so if anyone's tried to actually talk a

1134
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,200
lawyer through how to stand up

1135
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,200
a vulnerability disclosure policy it's

1136
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,760
um and the problem with with lawyers and

1137
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,359
this is their job right so i'm actually

1138
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,800
not faulting them for this

1139
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,400
when they're uncertain they're ambiguous

1140
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,240
they'll tend towards verbosity so you

1141
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,000
end up with like war and peace

1142
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
meanwhile you've got someone on the

1143
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,760
internet who is not a lawyer

1144
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,359
possibly doesn't even speak english as

1145
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,800
first language and you're asking them to

1146
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,160
actually read that stuff before they

1147
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,839
engage that's just not going to work

1148
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,599
so so really what we tried to do here is

1149
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,839
simplify all of that reduce the friction

1150
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,440
and then coming around the top of that

1151
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,599
how do we you know reduce it even to the

1152
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,960
point where it's like literally a green

1153
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,680
padlock

1154
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,480
or the equivalent to that so that anyone

1155
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,079
can look at an organization and say okay

1156
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,200
i get what they're doing i've got like

1157
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,560
neighborhood watch for the internet this

1158
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,359
is cool

1159
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,200
um so that's what that is if you want to

1160
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,040
get involved penis it's open source

1161
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,119
all those different things so really in

1162
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,320
summary

1163
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,119
it takes an army to outsmart an army i

1164
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:49,920
think we're all

1165
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,720
kind of pretty aware of that um but you

1166
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,240
know demonstrating the fact that's true

1167
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,920
it was part of the intent of this talk

1168
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,359
the community is at the table it's ready

1169
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,560
to help um there is tremendous leverage

1170
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,680
available for those who think

1171
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,839
differently actually find ways to engage

1172
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,320
with stuff like this and your customers

1173
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,599
are starting to expect this

1174
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,280
um i think it's you know over time going

1175
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,720
to become more of a thing that's just

1176
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,760
like wait you don't have that um

1177
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,280
signing off with our patreon saying

1178
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,280
grace hopper our ship important safe

1179
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,119
is safe but that's not what ships are

1180
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,200
for i think if we can engage that in

1181
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,880
terms of how we try to solve big cyber

1182
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,839
security problems

1183
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,200
we're on the right track thank you

1184
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,680
thank you

1185
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,400
all right we have a few questions on

1186
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,680
there on the app

1187
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,880
via the q a button so they are

1188
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,800
somewhat related i'll read out each one

1189
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,079
of them so

1190
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,920
the top scored one was

1191
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,960
how do you pitch a vdp to execs who

1192
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,040
believe that starting a program

1193
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,320
will make the company a target in quotes

1194
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,119
or in brackets avoiding the head in the

1195
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,240
sand mentality

1196
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,720
yeah um my tongue-in-cheek answer i

1197
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,240
usually give to that is show them

1198
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,920
your logs because it's kind of already

1199
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,119
happening uh they're just not getting

1200
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,640
the report so like and there's an

1201
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,240
element of truth and that you're not

1202
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,000
always going to have a receptive

1203
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,760
executive to that particular approach

1204
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,839
um i think that's what i was getting at

1205
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,680
with uh

1206
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,079
with what we did with with the election

1207
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,599
stuff in the us it's actually turning

1208
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,359
this into almost a virtue signal but

1209
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,560
like a real one

1210
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
so it's like this is a thing that you

1211
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,480
know we as an organization can go out

1212
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,920
and tell our customers

1213
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,119
that we're doing that they can

1214
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,200
understand like that's the beauty of vdp

1215
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,000
um you talk about edr or you know all of

1216
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,480
saw sim all these different things

1217
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,960
grandma probably doesn't get it but if

1218
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,000
you talk about

1219
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,760
neighborhood watch for the internet oh

1220
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,440
okay i kind of understand what's going

1221
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,000
on there

1222
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,160
so to be able to help them sell it to

1223
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,839
themselves internally and then actually

1224
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,119
use that as a way to promote the

1225
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,400
business that's a pretty effective way

1226
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,040
to do it

1227
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,400
yeah definitely and maybe something like

1228
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,480
metrics as well and show them the

1229
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,000
internet and they were like wow okay

1230
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,280
well there's a lot of bad people out

1231
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,400
there why don't we just close

1232
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,520
our neighborhood as it turns out

1233
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,280
and the second question is is related

1234
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,560
but i'll let you decide

1235
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,359
um what advice would you give companies

1236
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,560
trying to roll out

1237
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,960
their own vdp because they don't have

1238
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,680
management

1239
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,160
management support to use services like

1240
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,480
yours

1241
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,520
got it um that's honestly part of the

1242
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,800
reason we

1243
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,160
you know the the people that came

1244
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,480
together so discloso was

1245
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,400
partly um a product of a law firm out of

1246
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,359
dc

1247
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,640
um partly out of the berkeley university

1248
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,839
a whole bunch of other people kind of

1249
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,240
coalesced into this initiative

1250
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,320
ncia doj like they're all kind of

1251
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,079
triangulating around this idea of like

1252
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,079
how do we help people just do this

1253
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,359
um start there honestly because i think

1254
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,320
the legal part

1255
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,680
you know using that as a tool of

1256
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,280
alignment within the organization

1257
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,400
actually understand what the hell you're

1258
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,119
about to do

1259
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,320
that's a pretty important step um

1260
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,520
i think beyond that uh it really is

1261
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,200
you know just make sure the stakeholder

1262
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,960
alignment internally make sure that

1263
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,079
whatever you're putting out

1264
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,839
on the internet uh are a set of

1265
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,119
commitments that you can follow through

1266
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,400
on don't over

1267
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,560
don't over promise and under deliver

1268
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,440
because that

1269
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,480
you know it's one of those things that

1270
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,320
you just don't want to do in in this

1271
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,920
space and if you put the work in it's

1272
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,640
achievable

1273
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,040
um yeah bug crowd's role in doing that

1274
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,839
is to help

1275
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,359
companies make that easy help them set

1276
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,880
it up successfully do it well

1277
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,720
i'm honestly a huge fan of when folk do

1278
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,400
it themselves even though we don't get

1279
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,839
you know the deal necessarily because

1280
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,200
it's just something that should happen

1281
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,800
on the internet and the rest of what we

1282
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,320
do kind of benefits as a byproduct

1283
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,280
anyway so

1284
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
yeah that would be my advice thank you

1285
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,960
for that now

1286
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,240
there are no more questions on the app

1287
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,480
but are there any questions on the floor

1288
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,079
i can just run around and get my steps

1289
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,520
up don't be shy

1290
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,079
one yes

1291
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,960
so you talked about this year being the

1292
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,800
year of the software supply chain

1293
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,000
attacks yeah um i mean that's

1294
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,400
pretty difficult for a platform like bug

1295
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,240
crowd because you can't just have

1296
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,160
your entire software supply chain in

1297
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,359
scope for a

1298
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,680
program like that but is you know bug

1299
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,319
crowd starting to look at that at all

1300
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,280
yeah and you're right like i think

1301
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,640
you're right in terms of the entire

1302
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,160
software supply chain because it's

1303
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,400
literally turtles all the way down

1304
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,000
at this point in most verticals so

1305
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,680
there's just a lot of stuff you have to

1306
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,119
look at the entire internet to feel like

1307
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,359
you've covered it off to 100

1308
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,119
um where i'd push back on that a little

1309
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,560
bit is you know in

1310
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,400
in context of scope and different things

1311
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,560
like that um

1312
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,599
people will remove

1313
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,920
dynamic systems that they're not

1314
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,119
authorized to

1315
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,520
allow testing on on behalf of the owner

1316
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,560
they'll take that stuff

1317
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,400
out because that's you know you don't

1318
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,640
want to encourage violation of cfaa or

1319
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,920
whatever else right

1320
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,599
but oftentimes it's the interactions

1321
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,280
that will still surface and actually

1322
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,359
find or demonstrate things that need to

1323
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,560
be fixed anyway

1324
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,720
so in a way it's kind of already

1325
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,760
happening um

1326
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,599
just by observation of those

1327
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,280
relationships and those different things

1328
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,400
i think you know going forward um again

1329
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,680
this idea of just

1330
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,440
basically making vulnerability

1331
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,359
disclosure and this idea of research has

1332
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,319
been good

1333
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,040
ubiquitous in terms of open source

1334
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,800
you've got more at that point hackers

1335
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,599
looking at

1336
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,040
you know open source projects and saying

1337
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,880
hey there's a problem there like can i

1338
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,839
help you fix it because usually it's

1339
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,760
like two and a half people and a cat

1340
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,280
maintaining like half of some of the

1341
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,960
powers half the internet that's like

1342
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,880
status quo and open source so that

1343
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,160
part's hard too

1344
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,480
um there's a bunch of different people

1345
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,920
working on that like bug crowd's looking

1346
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,680
at that in terms of doing it proactively

1347
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,520
we do that with oems all the time so

1348
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,359
automotive industry for example

1349
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,240
um there's examples there it's it's a

1350
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
really dense question because

1351
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,839
you have to basically answer the

1352
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,280
question of what is the supply chain

1353
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,720
first and the answer to that is like no

1354
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,560
one really knows

1355
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,319
so extending it out to as much of the

1356
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,000
risk that affects an organization as

1357
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,800
possible

1358
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,200
and then by extension the internet as

1359
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,079
possible that's

1360
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,240
ultimately our goal so we're continually

1361
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,400
pushing in that direction

1362
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,560
cool thank you great question uh any

1363
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,800
other questions on the floor

1364
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,240
got plenty of time

1365
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,480
oh one more going again

1366
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,040
so working with the dod yeah um they're

1367
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,079
an interesting crowd

1368
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,440
very secretive uh what was it like

1369
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,760
actually getting into that space but

1370
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,960
then also have

1371
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,520
getting your researchers approved to

1372
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,200
work in that space

1373
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,399
good question um

1374
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,960
yeah so so the the the folks that

1375
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,640
actually drove that initiative

1376
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,079
uh were a group called the defense

1377
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,760
digital services group

1378
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,200
which are essentially the digital

1379
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,040
transformation arm of the dod so

1380
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,960
it's a bunch of like technologists who

1381
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,400
also have

1382
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,680
you know a military or service

1383
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,520
background um

1384
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,720
pretty much commissioned to go out and

1385
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,560
be a pain in the butt and like drag

1386
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,400
everyone else into the future that was

1387
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,920
sort of their job and they chose to

1388
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,440
start with this

1389
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,839
um so i think that there's a key in that

1390
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:00,880
like there was there was

1391
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,480
an internal set of stakeholders that

1392
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,319
really believed in the fact that it was

1393
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,839
a good thing and they were just pushing

1394
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,359
it and pushing and pushing and pushing

1395
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,800
and eventually it worked

1396
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,960
um i think that same principle we've

1397
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,560
seen that apply in corporate we've seen

1398
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,359
it apply

1399
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,079
in financial services like same actually

1400
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:16,720
it was

1401
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,400
the same story for western union it was

1402
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,599
their transformation group that brought

1403
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,359
us in in the first place so

1404
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,880
it's not an uncommon thing um yeah like

1405
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,599
organizations that are that old and you

1406
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,880
know in the case of dod

1407
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,800
like with that sort of tendency to be

1408
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,560
conservative and kind of

1409
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,240
you know close to the chest and in how

1410
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,920
they operate they've got

1411
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,760
naturally more inertia to overcome to

1412
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,359
get an idea like this off the ground

1413
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,760
than than others do than facebook or you

1414
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
know a 20 person startup

1415
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,319
but there are ways to get it done so

1416
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,040
that's

1417
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,000
that's really um how we've seen that

1418
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,920
work on the adoption side on the

1419
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,480
on the hacker side it's yeah the way

1420
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,920
that we've done it is like across that

1421
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,400
200

1422
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,920
000 you know or so um member list that i

1423
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,119
called out before it's basically a

1424
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,119
spectrum of trust so on the bottom

1425
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,319
you've got folk we don't

1426
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,560
even really know who you are and we

1427
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,319
actually don't have to because it's a

1428
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,680
public program so if you're just

1429
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,119
submitting an issue

1430
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,400
you know the people running that program

1431
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,079
don't actually care about trust in the

1432
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,440
same way as

1433
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,359
the air force would right so at the top

1434
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,040
you've got those guys

1435
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,480
that came down to um you know basically

1436
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,200
sovereignty

1437
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,359
and and clearance there was some degree

1438
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,720
of clearance requirement

1439
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,920
the other thing that we're doing as bug

1440
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,920
crowd is understanding behaviorally like

1441
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,880
how

1442
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,960
professional are you like if we ask you

1443
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,319
to do a certain set of things are you

1444
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,040
gonna

1445
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,480
like because that's not always the

1446
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,760
answer that's not always yes in the

1447
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,800
hacker community so

1448
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,880
we have to figure out who's who and and

1449
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,480
match the right people in and

1450
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,400
that was a it was a success in that

1451
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,839
program which is part of why i talk

1452
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:46,880
about it it's one of those ones where

1453
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,240
it's like wow you pulled that off that's

1454
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,440
amazing

1455
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,720
but it did work so yeah cool

1456
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,319
and that's all we've got time for so

1457
00:44:54,319 --> 00:45:04,720
thank you very much
