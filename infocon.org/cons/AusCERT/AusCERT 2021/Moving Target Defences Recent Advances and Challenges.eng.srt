1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,800
hello everyone um all right coming up

2
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,599
now we have dr dan kims associate

3
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,039
professor at the university of

4
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,720
queensland

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,000
i'm a uq alumni myself

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,440
and he's here to talk about moving

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,200
target defenses

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,399
recent advances and challenges

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,760
thank you

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,719
uh it's very my great honor to give a

11
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,000
talk at all search conference

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,160
2021. uh today i'm going to talk about

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,640
moving target differences and

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,199
some recent events and some challenges

15
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,720
and before i'm going to talk about

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,320
moving target defense let me introduce

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,320
myself a little bit i'm an editor board

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,720
member of elsevier computers and

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,000
security

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,640
which is one of the top journal in cyber

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,920
security area

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,560
also i started serving the ieee

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,119
communications and surveys and tutorials

24
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,119
it's the number one impact

25
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,200
in the all italy journals

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
there are about 220 ipp journals and i

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,079
served as general chair and co-chair for

28
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,520
the conferences

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,560
acisp and pldc

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,119
and so on and my publication

31
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,640
according to the google scholar is more

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,159
than

33
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,920
3850

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,640
and i have published more than 130

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,560
papers

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,200
in journals and conferencing workshops

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,479
over the years

38
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,799
i have done some research in

39
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,439
and development uh in regard to moving

40
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,200
target defense

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,840
uh sponsored by new zealand governments

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,439
and also u.s

43
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,200
army research lab

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,199
and i got

45
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,760
fundings from u.s army's lab three times

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,319
i'm also working on that now

47
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,959
and this is the list of projects i've

48
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,920
done with the u.s omg lab in

49
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,839
regards to moving target differences

50
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,000
and this is a talk line line first i'm

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,599
going to talk about the

52
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,760
background of mtd

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,400
and then three-dimensional

54
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
aspect of mtd

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,280
and

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,319
uh what type of mtds are existing

57
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,560
and then some empty related mattresses

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,040
then i'm going to talk about some

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,400
of my work

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,200
in

61
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,200
mtd techniques for the cloud computing

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,080
in vehicle networks and iot

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,599
and

64
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,959
other areas and then i'm going to

65
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,519
introduce some other activities going on

66
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,879
in academia and also industry

67
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,440
and finally i'm going to introduce some

68
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,879
challenges and future directions

69
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,120
before i'm going to talk about mtd let

70
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,840
me summarize some terms the system so we

71
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,920
can think of the asset as it can be any

72
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,800
system resources including hardware

73
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,560
software and data and communication

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,879
facilities and some examples of iot

75
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,879
assets are infrastructure

76
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,680
applications endpoints and iot

77
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
cloud and supply chain

78
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,319
and

79
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,120
in

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,959
in the sys in a system or a network

81
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,000
there is a proven ability

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,239
vulnerabilities of flow or weakness that

83
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,120
could be

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,480
exploited by

85
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,799
attackers and to violate system

86
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,080
securities goals like cia

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,319
and there are tech surfaces attack

88
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,239
surface is a uh

89
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,280
a collection of reachable and explorable

90
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,920
vulnerabilities in a system and network

91
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,200
in the maybe the i.t assets

92
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
and then there are mitigation strategy

93
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,799
in terms of

94
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,720
prevention detection and tolerance and

95
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,920
sometimes resiliency

96
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,959
and then why we need an mtd

97
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,680
first reason is that is it possible to

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,599
make a perfectly secure system

99
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,759
yeah no it's not possible so there are

100
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,079
always a way to find vulnerability in

101
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,880
the system and networks

102
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,800
and how about this traditional defense

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,840
techniques are very passive mostly and

104
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,960
aesthetic

105
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,160
so once you apply it then you use it for

106
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,639
a long time

107
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,520
but attacker has advantage of a defender

108
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,919
because they have developed advanced

109
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,120
techniques

110
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,240
in penter writing systems and networks

111
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,919
developing new exploits

112
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,560
new ways to find the vulnerabilities and

113
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
then they exploit them continuously and

114
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,239
try to compromise systems and networks

115
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,840
then how then this call calls that uh

116
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,600
this generates a symmetry between

117
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,759
attacker and defender so attacker has

118
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,680
advantage over

119
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,120
defender

120
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,280
this way attackers are bigger than

121
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,520
and defender so can you change this

122
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,720
landscape

123
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,520
how

124
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,600
right that's my question that's why

125
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,240
their mtd is required so can you change

126
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,039
the situation like this way or maybe

127
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,320
a great uh

128
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,280
dependent has much more power than

129
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,840
attackers

130
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,360
so one way to do this one is to

131
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,400
apply

132
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,560
moving target defense

133
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,120
so moving target defense technique uh

134
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,880
continuously change

135
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,120
the attack surface

136
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,240
uh to twerk attacks

137
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
and uh

138
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,000
it's like a

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,039
trading or cyber or slash digital shell

140
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,280
game have you done initial game before

141
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,440
so you have a ball

142
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,479
right

143
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,800
and then you mix the cups

144
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,600
then

145
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,639
ask that where is that right so if a

146
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,000
system can be dynamically changed

147
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,199
right in a regular basis or maybe by uh

148
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,800
triggering events

149
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,600
then

150
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,039
uh attacker will be uh not easier to

151
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,919
attack that one so mtd

152
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,080
is trying to make it

153
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,440
much harder

154
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,639
for attacker to their dirty work by

155
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,240
consistently change

156
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,720
the attack surface

157
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,319
and also the

158
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,560
defenders environments

159
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,520
and

160
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,520
also it try to increase the urgent t

161
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,680
and also includes the complexity for

162
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,120
attackers

163
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,000
right

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
that's the main goal and there are three

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,280
dimensions in mtd first dimension is

166
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,639
what to move

167
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,080
so how you can change system

168
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,400
configurations

169
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,080
from the static configuration to the

170
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,280
dynamic

171
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,120
so what elements

172
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,080
we can

173
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,759
use to do that

174
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,039
that's the first

175
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,639
uh dimension

176
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,960
what to move so it's about moving

177
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,000
elements so it can be a single element

178
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,639
there can be a multiple elements

179
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,560
so and the second uh uh dimension is how

180
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,680
to move it's about techniques

181
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
so

182
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,599
how

183
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,319
you can choose an element or more

184
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,280
and how you can move that elements

185
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,599
right that's the second one technique

186
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,400
the third one is when to move

187
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,520
so it's about adaption strategy

188
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,319
uh

189
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,560
so first the

190
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,520
moving elements so i i listed

191
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,039
the potential layers we can think about

192
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,800
from the hardware

193
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,960
virtual machine monitor this is called

194
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,639
hypervisor

195
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,639
and virtual machine

196
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,680
instance

197
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,080
in a cloud or a virtualized system

198
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,919
an operating system

199
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,879
an application and so on so this can be

200
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,960
applied in many different areas so i

201
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,160
will show you

202
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
what are the albumin elements you can

203
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,919
think about

204
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,360
in a minute

205
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,160
and then second one is about how to move

206
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,120
uh i classify them into three different

207
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
categories

208
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,360
including diversity

209
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,319
redundancy and shuffle

210
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,440
okay

211
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,639
and for the uh when to move

212
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,199
we can divide them into three cases time

213
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,120
based

214
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,479
event based

215
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,319
and hybrid type

216
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,279
so now i'm going to talk about one by

217
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,519
one

218
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,919
the first one is what to move it's

219
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,279
moving elements

220
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,599
so we published this one you know a acm

221
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,720
ccs workshop mtd workshop there is a mtd

222
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,640
workshop annual workshop at

223
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,240
international with a acmccs conference

224
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,279
and we listed all the uh some of the

225
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,760
existing uh elements

226
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,519
that you could think about if you take a

227
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,200
look at this table

228
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,920
uh if you see the diversity

229
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
so what kind of

230
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,720
different

231
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,959
hardware we can use

232
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,320
to increase

233
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,959
the complexity of attacks

234
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,760
so from the hardware point of view we

235
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,959
can use different cpu and their

236
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,720
hardware architecture

237
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,959
and so on and for the virtual machine

238
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,600
monitor hypervisor level uh there can be

239
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,080
a you can choose a zen or a vmware or an

240
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,800
exi server right and so on then maybe

241
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,399
there are more than that

242
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,120
and the virtual machine uh we may use uh

243
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,560
same as os

244
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
or maybe different version and then os

245
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,240
level we can use different versions of

246
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,080
os and different version of kernels and

247
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,279
so on

248
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,200
and then for the application

249
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,360
for the same application we can use

250
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,959
different

251
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,519
software version right for example

252
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,080
web we can use iis or

253
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,800
apache and the different version as well

254
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,200
and for the redundancy we can think

255
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,480
about how we can use different uh type

256
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,880
of replicas

257
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,519
so that uh this this can increase the

258
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,399
availability and reliability of uh

259
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,640
systems we want to protect

260
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,399
the last one the shuffle

261
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,640
we can change some values

262
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,920
uh you know timely based or event based

263
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,640
so some of them can be the port number

264
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,959
can be changed where virtual ip can be

265
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,000
changed

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
and personal ip and port number can be

267
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,079
changed

268
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,160
on a regular basis that's all the

269
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,839
possible elements you can think of

270
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,160
course there are much more than that

271
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,000
but we summarize that into this table

272
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,079
and if i give an example for each

273
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,640
techniques shuffle can be

274
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,680
we uh can keep the real ip address as

275
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,880
they are

276
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,200
but we can change virtual ip address

277
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,600
every x period time so every one minute

278
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,880
birch life pictures can be changed and

279
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,760
then

280
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,560
uh

281
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,480
attacker is trying to scan

282
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,920
the network

283
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
then either change already right so what

284
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,079
is the typical the port scanning ip

285
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,800
scanning time it may takes maybe a few

286
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,720
seconds to the minutes

287
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,920
then if the ip address is being changed

288
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,760
then even though attack can find the

289
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,839
data ip address during that period of

290
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,959
time it's gone in the next pace

291
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,440
right that's why this is very efficient

292
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,160
so pressure shuffling can be applied how

293
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,200
we can realize that one we may use uh

294
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,440
scn technology uh software department

295
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,279
networking technology is easy to

296
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,519
configure that at the software switch

297
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,640
level or some some researchers use a

298
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,440
middleware or a proxy solver to do that

299
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,240
work

300
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,560
so real ip address does not change but

301
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,360
only the virtual ip address are located

302
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,320
to the real ip address is changing every

303
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,120
uh time interval right that's the idea

304
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,040
of shuffling a sharpening can be

305
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,600
happened in many different ways

306
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,560
based on what elements

307
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,760
a security designer can choose

308
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,000
the second one is a redundancy rather

309
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,160
than having one single solver but you

310
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,399
can think about having two solver

311
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,800
especially this redundancy is not very

312
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,560
new technique but

313
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,040
in the full tones design is very

314
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
commonly used

315
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,959
so if you increase number of replica or

316
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,959
a number of servers it's good for uh

317
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,680
availability perspective of systems

318
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,680
right so that's the redundancy can be

319
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,560
used and this redundancy can be

320
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,279
same replica or it can be a diversely

321
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,240
picked as well so they so

322
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,560
redundancy can be combined with other

323
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,040
techniques also this redundancy can be

324
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,519
combined with shuffle as well

325
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,800
so each

326
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,040
server may have different virtual life

327
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,120
addresses located rather than having the

328
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,639
same ip address

329
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,959
and the last one is the diversity we can

330
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,399
use different

331
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,160
version of software

332
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,959
this can be done at the os level

333
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,760
application level or compiler level or

334
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,880
different

335
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,560
program languages

336
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,160
so that's different implementations

337
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,000
and and this uh summarized

338
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,279
some benefits when uh diversity

339
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,000
redundancy supplies use shuffle is very

340
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
efficient

341
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,680
and uh

342
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,440
because it's you don't have to change

343
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,639
much thing but only ip address virtual

344
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,760
port number it's very efficient to

345
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,199
implement the redundancy can can help to

346
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,120
increase the reliability and

347
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,360
availability of systems

348
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,920
and the diversity can

349
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,360
enhance

350
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,920
resiliency and robustness of

351
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,760
the systems and networks that's the

352
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
benefits also they have a drawbacks i'm

353
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,440
going to talk about that too

354
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,480
soon

355
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,839
and the last

356
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,560
d is about when to move

357
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,880
so this can be done and when system

358
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,079
starts

359
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,320
time based one every

360
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,279
time interval for example 300 second

361
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,519
you can change the ip address

362
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,079
and move can happen right the average

363
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,880
another 300 seconds elapsed then

364
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,440
a move can be

365
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,399
happening and another move or this can

366
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,519
be done based on events or

367
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,399
uh

368
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,040
maybe all multiple events for example

369
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,880
on intrusion detection

370
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,720
alert is generated

371
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,560
then it may

372
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,720
uh trigger a move

373
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,800
right rather than waiting until the next

374
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,519
interval that's the idea of that so this

375
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,279
event can be any many different things

376
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,560
right so this event can be user-driven

377
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,000
so i want to do it uh randomly

378
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,199
because to to protect the system against

379
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,519
much more intelligent attackers

380
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,600
and this can be combined together so

381
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,800
this is called hybrid triggering

382
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,320
so event based and time-based mtd can be

383
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,440
used same time

384
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,519
and that there is some delay for this

385
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,959
one right of course in intrusion

386
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,480
directions alert is

387
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,760
uh

388
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,079
generated then you need to check that

389
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,040
whether this event is actually

390
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,360
a correct one or not and it takes some

391
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
time to check that

392
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,279
and so stretch-wise there's some delay

393
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,720
as well

394
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,959
and

395
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,440
now let me introduce some mtd related

396
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,360
mattresses so we can think about

397
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
security matrices

398
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,120
and the performability mattress and

399
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,040
economy matrices

400
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,839
so when we think about uh

401
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,480
to adopt mtd techniques

402
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,600
to uh our uh some system we want to

403
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,720
protect

404
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
first one security there are many so

405
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,079
many different types of security

406
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,360
matrices

407
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,759
some examples are system risk

408
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,920
system risk can be computed by

409
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,759
multiplying the probability and the

410
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,360
impact value

411
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,320
and

412
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,360
and also

413
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,959
attack cost

414
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,800
and attack path

415
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,440
and the vulnerability level and the

416
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,519
probability of the success and many

417
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,000
other mattresses can be used to

418
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,360
show that different aspects of mtd so

419
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,079
let's say that we have a static system

420
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,720
and also we have a stack system which is

421
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,399
adopting some part of some uh of the mtd

422
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,440
techniques

423
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,560
so can we compare that how efficient or

424
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,680
effective

425
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,480
uh the system adopting mtd technique

426
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,120
right so it may show that there's some

427
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,360
improvement in the system risk

428
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,079
but

429
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,079
it may uh

430
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,360
lower some

431
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,519
all right at that cost but

432
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,639
it may interest another problems one of

433
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,680
the problem can be performance so for

434
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,639
example

435
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,360
uh users are using a system

436
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,440
then they want to connect to the system

437
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,199
which is adopting mtd

438
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,000
then there's end-to-end connections

439
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,680
suddenly empty is triggered what

440
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,520
happened

441
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,000
the connection will be lost right so

442
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
especially that the

443
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,720
the tcp connection is long tail then it

444
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,919
may cause

445
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,919
maybe some performance drop

446
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,559
degradation right and this can be a

447
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,720
critical problem so we also measure not

448
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,760
only the security aspect of the mtd

449
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,720
but also performance so that it may

450
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
cause some blocking of

451
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,200
connections also dropping of existing

452
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,400
connections

453
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,080
and also it may

454
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,320
downgrade the qos level right throughput

455
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,720
can be dropped and so on right

456
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,960
so we we try to

457
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,720
develop mtd techniques which can satisfy

458
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,640
the secure level

459
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,799
also performance also

460
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,960
also this has some trade-off if you want

461
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
to increase the security

462
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,919
then we may need to

463
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,120
sacrifice this performance right so

464
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,039
let's say the attacker can

465
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,799
uh find the virtual ip address within uh

466
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,720
an order of seconds

467
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,960
then we have to trigger mtdg very

468
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,600
frequently right i think i can find the

469
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,679
virtual ip address being used

470
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,360
within uh order of minutes then we can

471
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,480
less frequently trigger mtd in terms of

472
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,200
the time-based mtd techniques

473
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,080
so that we we're going to lose less

474
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,200
connections of the estimated users right

475
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,960
that's the idea of that also when you

476
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,640
think about the cost

477
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,400
economic way so when mtd is adopted in

478
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,760
the system

479
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,880
uh does roi is improved a lot a lot

480
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
right return on investment or return on

481
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,960
security investment increases or not

482
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,120
that's that should be considered also

483
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,000
when we have a static system then

484
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,400
adopted mtd techniques then that

485
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,600
anti-technique uh may need some capital

486
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,919
expansion investment also operational

487
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,039
costs

488
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,840
so so with this all the compressive

489
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,080
consideration of security

490
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,000
econo uh probability and recurring

491
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,880
mattresses we can think about this mtd

492
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,280
technique is effective and efficient or

493
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
maybe considered ineffective or

494
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,280
efficient this is the idea of mtd

495
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,240
technique and mattresses

496
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,520
this

497
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,720
clutch

498
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,080
summarizes what i've done over the last

499
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,200
nine years

500
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,240
or so

501
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,799
so this paper published

502
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,400
2013

503
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,640
first one and then over there i

504
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,360
published a lot of papers in mtd area

505
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,000
so start with the how we can evaluate

506
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,720
the effectiveness of mtd techniques

507
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,799
and then develop the neural

508
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,320
anti-technique

509
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,640
and scalable mtd techniques

510
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,520
and

511
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,000
develop anti-technique for uh

512
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,600
iot

513
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,520
and sdn

514
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,600
and also cloud computing

515
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,400
the domain and also develop some dynamic

516
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,240
matrices for mtd techniques

517
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,039
and this is a summary of that uh

518
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,440
and then uh

519
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,360
i have a

520
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,679
supervised four graduate and they worked

521
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,600
on these different topics

522
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,000
and first one

523
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,640
mostly focus on effectiveness evaluation

524
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,559
of mtd techniques

525
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,960
so let's say uh if you

526
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,520
if a network is

527
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,159
adopting mtd technique does it improve

528
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,280
the security or not right how effective

529
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
or ineffective that mtv technique so we

530
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,320
need to evaluate that before we adopt

531
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
that one or maybe deploy that mtd

532
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,440
technique so this uh this ph student at

533
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,720
the time was focusing on uh how to use a

534
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,200
graphical model to evaluate

535
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,840
effectiveness of mtd techniques second

536
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,200
phd

537
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,320
she was working on the mtd and the cyber

538
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,600
session technology for iot domain and

539
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,200
third one developed uh high virtual ip

540
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,799
shuffling and virtual port shuffling for

541
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,159
uh scn networks and we also have a test

542
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,760
bed for that

543
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,280
the last one

544
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,600
here was interesting combination of

545
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,640
empty techniques for cloud computing so

546
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,919
i'll show some demo for that

547
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,760
so let me show you some uh

548
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,320
the technique applied to the cloud

549
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,039
some some sort real domain first one is

550
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,480
mtd for the cloud and the second mtd in

551
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
the uh sdn

552
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,880
and third is mtd for the in vehicle

553
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,400
networks

554
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,679
and the last one is uh mtd folder iot

555
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,520
networks

556
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,280
this is a real implementation so we use

557
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,039
a unitec cloud

558
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,520
and we also made a graphical user

559
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,880
interface

560
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,640
to trigger mtd in the cloud environments

561
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,679
and

562
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,159
let me show you some demo hopefully it

563
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,280
should work i just use a usb stick so

564
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,720
let me click that one

565
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,840
ah yeah

566
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,480
yeah it works

567
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,440
so this shows a shuffle so for the mtd

568
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,159
we use a virtual machine migration as a

569
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,840
shuffling technique

570
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,559
so you can see that uh some of the nodes

571
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,360
the virtual machine uh is moving from

572
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,320
one

573
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
logical host to the other

574
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,159
so we can change the configuration of uh

575
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,120
cloud computing so that uh uh it's not

576
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,200
dynamic anymore so a

577
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,440
virtual machine in the cloud virtualized

578
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,320
environment can move from one

579
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,640
to the other way so

580
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,039
on a regular basis or event based that's

581
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,480
the first demo the second one is um

582
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,280
diversity so we use different or virtual

583
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,600
machine version

584
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,720
so very slow

585
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,000
yeah

586
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,080
so you can see that the the os version

587
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,760
of course this can be implemented at

588
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,880
different way so application level or

589
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,240
other level but we we choose that one so

590
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,679
you can see that different version of

591
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,799
os's

592
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,000
and that that can be deployed uh

593
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,159
based on uh

594
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,960
our policy and the rules and then your

595
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,280
implementation so we use the api

596
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,120
provided by the

597
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,280
private cloud

598
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,480
and you can see that

599
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,120
we can apply different types of

600
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,799
os version in the cloud

601
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,679
and the last one is a redundancy and

602
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,000
this this one you can see that the sum

603
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,159
of virtual machine uh

604
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,559
have multiple replicas

605
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,240
so you can look at look at them in the

606
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,400
middle so some node

607
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,159
so you can see that the

608
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,400
new circle will be generated can you see

609
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,559
that yeah it's quickly happened so that

610
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,440
uh

611
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,400
we can generate redundancy uh in real

612
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,200
time of in the cloud environments so

613
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,840
that uh it can increase the availability

614
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
of uh

615
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,639
a cloud system

616
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,799
and the next one is that how we can

617
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,279
implement mtd in the sdn

618
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,640
so we have

619
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
tested this one in the stochastic

620
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,760
modeling

621
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,720
using petri net modeling and also use a

622
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,679
simulation also we have or our own test

623
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,360
bed so using a soft switch

624
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,240
and

625
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,840
the idea is this

626
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,039
when attacker is trying to penetrate the

627
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,760
system and then make a later movement to

628
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,200
reach a target and exfoliate the data

629
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,520
we assume that attacker can follow the

630
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,240
cyber key chain so located by team one

631
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,799
so from data collection right so the

632
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,360
first step is to collect data about that

633
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,080
so

634
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,840
very typically

635
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,640
attacker use port scanning or ip

636
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,919
scanning then if the

637
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,960
virtual ip address and

638
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,919
real ip address mapping is changing

639
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,440
every unit time

640
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,720
how effect

641
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,400
effective this one

642
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,440
against

643
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,000
port scanning ip scanning so we

644
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,960
tested that in the our scene test bed

645
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,039
and also measure that uh how long it

646
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,919
takes

647
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,799
to

648
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,440
find a virtual address address being

649
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,799
located to on end host right for a given

650
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,640
period of time

651
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,120
and this shows very effective way so

652
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,880
this is one of the example of that it's

653
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,400
called the flexible

654
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,840
random virtual ip multiplexing in short

655
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,520
flvm

656
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,440
as you can see that

657
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
one real ip address

658
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,320
is mapped with the multiple virtual ip

659
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,480
address and port number here port number

660
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,480
is a real port number the virtual ip

661
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,960
address is a different prototype address

662
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,880
so we can use 24

663
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,000
or 16 depending on how well uh this uh

664
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,960
system want to use right so 16 then if

665
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,760
you use a 16 sider then it's a 2 to the

666
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
16 right it can be used for the virtual

667
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,400
life address this is really hard to find

668
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,919
within a minute or three minutes that's

669
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,400
attacker so sometimes it's lucky enough

670
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,960
then i can find it then next one is

671
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,159
attacker can

672
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,159
find some vulnerability

673
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,679
in the end host

674
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,840
then scan that then they take another

675
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,039
time then uh attacker is successful to

676
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,200
find the vulnerability then attacker can

677
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,840
exploit that balloon ability then

678
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,760
entities triggered right then attackers

679
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,039
template is gone

680
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,720
something like that so attacker can

681
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,360
achieve all the steps from the data

682
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,559
collection

683
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,679
to the

684
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,360
backdoor installation

685
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,799
if it takes maybe

686
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,919
order of

687
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,360
between the

688
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
empty interval maybe during the second

689
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,520
then attacker will

690
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,440
maybe have that access to the internal

691
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,880
system right so we want to

692
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,440
reduce the time interval if there are

693
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,640
frequent

694
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,000
attack attempts

695
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,440
if there's less attempts then we can uh

696
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,760
increase the time interval right that's

697
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,840
the main idea of that and this is

698
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,559
implemented and tested as well

699
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,880
and a lot next one is that in vehicle

700
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,080
networks one of the the project uh i'm

701
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,640
currently currently working on uh with

702
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,000
the arl is that how to apply moving

703
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,080
target defense techniques to the

704
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,919
in-vehicle network this can be used to

705
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,640
the autonomous vehicle as well right so

706
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,679
in beacon network they have many ecu's

707
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,399
electric computer unit and then they the

708
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,320
ecu's are communicating

709
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,640
uh by our canvas

710
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,880
it's a chi area network

711
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,679
and

712
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,720
that uh if a attacker outside of the

713
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,919
vehicle can connect to the uh the car

714
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,760
then they can compromise some of the

715
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,679
ecu's then they can shut down the

716
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,480
function of the ecu how we can

717
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,120
make this difficult right

718
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,679
the one of the ideas use mtd technique

719
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,559
for

720
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,480
in vehicle networks so we started with

721
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,360
them and there was we also have an ids

722
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,640
module so it can detect ongoing attack

723
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,520
we are using ai technique to detect it

724
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
and also use a misused detection engine

725
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,919
as well so by detecting some ongoing

726
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,360
attacks we can adjust the trigger uh

727
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,480
interval

728
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,440
okay so that if you see a lot of alerts

729
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,120
generated from the

730
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,360
uh in vehicle network then we trigger

731
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,960
more mtd and also how we can develop the

732
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,720
empty techniques in this work we change

733
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,279
the address shuffling of a packet header

734
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,640
so that the attacker can get some of the

735
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,399
the canvas messages

736
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,039
but it's invalid after

737
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,679
uh after some minutes that's the idea of

738
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,320
in vehicle network mtd techniques

739
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,880
uh this is one of the state-of-the-art

740
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,640
work uh we have been working on

741
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,120
and the last one i want to introduce is

742
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,679
that how we can apply that to mtd for

743
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,880
the iot so here we combine the mtd

744
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,760
technique with a cyber deception

745
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,640
so this shows a very simple iot network

746
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,480
and you can see that there are multiple

747
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,240
subnets uh

748
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,799
represented as a dotted rectangular

749
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,880
and then we can put some

750
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,640
uh deception nodes

751
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,520
this decoy node reception node can be

752
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
low interaction decoy nodes or maybe

753
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,120
high interruption decoy knots low

754
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,520
interaction decoy node is cheap and

755
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,840
attacker can find out this is a low one

756
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,520
right it's easily figured out high

757
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,360
direction is a expensive but it mimics

758
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,440
real behavior of iot nodes and those

759
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,159
servers so when attackers trying to get

760
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,039
to the

761
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,480
deception nodes

762
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,720
then uh

763
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,320
it's forward to the uh decoy server then

764
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,080
attacker cannot get anything

765
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,039
and

766
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,000
also we can shuffle the network topology

767
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,080
so that the reachability from the entry

768
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,960
point to the target server can be

769
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,320
changed

770
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,679
uh based on the time-based mtd or

771
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,120
uh event-based mtd so this can be used

772
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,200
for their iot networks so we've been

773
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,600
doing this one also with the arl but not

774
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,679
not the same team with different team so

775
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,520
we publish some papers in this domain as

776
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,960
well

777
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,440
and i have listed some

778
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,399
activities uh being carried out in

779
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,679
academia

780
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,919
so arizona state university they are

781
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,320
interested in the mtd and sdn and they

782
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,120
try to apply the game theoretical

783
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,919
approaches to the mtd how attackers

784
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,480
behave and how defend they behave this

785
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,039
can be formulated as a game so that

786
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,200
that's what was done and the carnegie

787
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,240
mellon university and uh

788
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,559
sci the software engineering institute

789
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,399
in the canada university they want to

790
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,320
develop middleware for mtd techniques so

791
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,399
they do not want to change any legacy

792
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,240
system

793
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,200
also

794
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,120
but they want to provide empty technique

795
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,200
how what's the way they can build a

796
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,600
middleware which can understand

797
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,760
the static systems

798
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,919
configuration and the messages and then

799
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,000
the attackers right on the lessman user

800
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,840
so they want to develop middleware which

801
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,399
can provide mtd technique and the george

802
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,640
mason university they are interested in

803
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,200
mtd quantification also performance

804
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,679
model for mtd and penn state university

805
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,159
they are interested in how to use all

806
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,440
reinforcement learning uh to

807
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,519
decide which mtd actions are the best

808
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,760
and uh universal south florida they are

809
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,000
interested in empty theory and mtd for

810
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,640
the scn uh university queensland i'm

811
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,000
called

812
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,519
we're interested in how

813
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,000
can the model attack

814
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,480
attack model based mtd also we want to

815
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,039
develop mtd data metrics and also i

816
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,440
already introduced some of my research

817
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,440
outputs

818
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,960
and in the companies

819
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,440
uh i cannot interest every company but i

820
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,760
i want to highlight some of them so many

821
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,600
people ask about this mtd is actually

822
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,039
practical

823
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,840
yeah the answer is yes so you may know

824
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,399
that uh as a uh

825
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,279
asrl is already implemented in the linux

826
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,399
kernel right it's it's a long time back

827
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,360
so from 2020 so you can regard this as a

828
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,440
mtd technique it's a type of shuffling

829
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,799
technique

830
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,240
and also in the open bs bsd and the

831
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,679
window vista and what now windows 10 has

832
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,360
this one aslr and also kernel

833
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,039
aslr is applied in ibm research hi far

834
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,360
they they want to develop uh mtd

835
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,039
technique uh against rop so rp is a

836
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,799
return oriented programming right this

837
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,960
is a more advanced memory

838
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,080
uh based attacks uh in the systems so

839
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,440
they want to use mtd technique and by

840
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,799
shuffling the

841
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,720
uh the sequence of uh program executions

842
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,039
yeah so this is the ongoing work and

843
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,760
morphe sac is one company they want to

844
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,320
develop the cybersecurity solution based

845
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,440
on mtd

846
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,240
for and host protection so they want to

847
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,760
protect the virtual desktop

848
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,159
infrastructure and this is funded by

849
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,279
the usdod and dhs

850
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,600
there's several millions of project

851
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,760
and the next ie they are they are

852
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,600
focusing on the entity for the data

853
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,919
storage uh area

854
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,640
and the crypto next next one there they

855
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,960
want to develop hardware device it's

856
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,640
like a proxy between

857
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,600
uh

858
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,399
users and static systems right they want

859
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,880
to protect the system but rather than

860
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,039
changing the system they want to develop

861
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,760
a device like a secure box so they can

862
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,840
put them in the middle so this can

863
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,560
provide some shuttling techniques in

864
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,960
between so that they can protect the

865
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,440
legacy and static systems that's just a

866
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,879
long way to work of course i haven't

867
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,599
listed all the companies i cannot find

868
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,760
all of them but this is a somewhat

869
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,719
example that how the companies and

870
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,320
the products are being developed

871
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,679
okay last one is uh the challenge of the

872
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,839
mtd techniques

873
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,239
so i have listed four of them the first

874
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,079
one is the security and performance and

875
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,359
cost tradeoff so you can see that

876
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,520
if you trigger mtd a lot

877
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,119
then it introduced downtime

878
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,679
or maybe performance degradation and

879
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,000
also that downtime calls the

880
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,040
uh penalty of their services right

881
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,719
so how we can adjust this one it's a

882
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,119
trade-off second one is that can you

883
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,359
develop hybrid mtd

884
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,160
for that that can be optimized right so

885
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,880
how often mtd is triggered

886
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,880
and how often we can trigger event based

887
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,839
mtd

888
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,079
for a certain system so can you optimize

889
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,640
that that's the second challenge the

890
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,760
third challenge is about uh so i

891
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,920
introduced some practical services

892
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,680
but there are still some more

893
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,320
improvements right that needed to be

894
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,000
needed and testing as well so i

895
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,839
developed my own

896
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,599
purpose techniques and

897
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,320
and not doing research but we need more

898
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,880
tests and then deployment and and so on

899
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,960
that's that's the challenges and the

900
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,400
last one is that

901
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,079
can we advance

902
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,240
the mtd technique itself

903
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,480
against ai based attacks

904
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,800
so we assume that the dummy attackers

905
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
maybe a little a little intelligent

906
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,880
attacker not very smart smartest

907
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,040
attacker right smartest attacker will

908
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,920
use very sophisticated techniques to

909
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,160
from the data collection to the

910
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,520
achieving the goal

911
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,320
so can we develop empty techniques

912
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,280
which is adaptive and also

913
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,760
very intelligent about airbase attacks

914
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,520
that's the challenge as well and then

915
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,680
the last one is the future direction is

916
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,800
of how you can do these things right

917
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,520
that i list the same thing for that uh

918
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,240
fish interaction

919
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,240
okay that's it uh for uh today's talk

920
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,720
yeah thank you

921
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
all right um we've got one question in

922
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,920
there so far but if you have any

923
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,839
questions feel free to chucking me up

924
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,119
really quick

925
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,440
um so our first one is many

926
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,680
organizations struggle to do

927
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,400
basic bcp and dr

928
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,520
are there bite size mtd recommendations

929
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,760
that could be used to implement for high

930
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,560
risk systems as a first step

931
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,359
so

932
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,200
where can we get started with mtd

933
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,400
yeah so easy adoption could be the

934
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,480
virtual ip shuffling as long as we have

935
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,400
some infrastructure supports

936
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,720
soft switch that could be easy one so

937
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,760
andos have uh this virtual ip shopping

938
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,200
and purchase for shuffling it's easy to

939
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,599
implement and as long as

940
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,359
you can buy some

941
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,359
additional devices yeah that's possible

942
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,320
cool um from andrew great work and

943
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,240
there's many uses

944
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,400
and i wanted to chuck one question out

945
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,040
there myself um in your example for

946
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,720
diversity you had

947
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,599
uh

948
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,400
an example with uh apache servers and

949
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,920
iis servers

950
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,839
um does that end up

951
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,839
you know expanding your threat landscape

952
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,760
in terms of zero day vulnerabilities

953
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,920
yes so that's uh

954
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,839
even though we introduce diversity it

955
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,920
doesn't guarantee that the security will

956
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,119
be improved

957
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,079
yes it may interest more uh

958
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,520
attack factors

959
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,920
also attack surface you can widen that

960
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,320
so for the zero day uh

961
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,520
somewhat that we do not trust anything

962
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,839
then we do not know that what's the new

963
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,000
attack will be coming up by exploring

964
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,160
the vulnerabilities that the one way is

965
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,640
to change things right it may help may

966
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,440
not depending on how quickly attacker

967
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,920
can proceed with the majority

968
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,440
vulnerability let's say that new

969
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,599
generator vulnerability and then

970
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,680
x and later exploit can quickly uh

971
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,880
achieve all the goal from the entry to

972
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,079
the end

973
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,640
within empty interval the mtd will not

974
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
be effective

975
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,400
but if not then until entity is still

976
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,520
valid yep

977
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,040
old school

978
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,160
yep so is there value in uh in

979
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,240
disrupting the reconnaissance more than

980
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,280
there is on actually changing the the

981
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,520
architecture of the landscape so how the

982
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,880
things that what what what

983
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,640
infrastructure you might be using so if

984
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,640
you disrupt the if you disrupt the

985
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,800
reconnaissance in the first place

986
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,880
you put the attacker back so far that it

987
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,960
might never ever catch up and you can

988
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,880
slow down the other changes which are

989
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,640
there before you can keep your

990
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,560
availability going and you give up this

991
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,240
service disruption

992
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,200
but you you're holding back the attacker

993
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,560
by just giving them lots of false

994
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,400
information

995
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,040
yes that's possible so um

996
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,880
currently that we if you think about the

997
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,960
reconnaissance as a first step

998
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,280
and then that's the first attempt right

999
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,040
to block it but

1000
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,920
uh attacker has already done the the

1001
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
data collection about the potential

1002
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,839
server then we need to think about the

1003
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,880
next level mtd so not just a single

1004
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,320
layer mtd

1005
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,560
when you think about defense in depth

1006
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,359
so multiple layer of mtd so i also think

1007
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,160
about that too so how we can develop

1008
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,079
this um

1009
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,720
stronger mtd

1010
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,960
with a what-if scenario what if the

1011
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,560
first step is done

1012
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,800
and uh attacker is already inside of the

1013
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,040
network right yeah that's a very good

1014
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,960
question yeah yeah that's that should be

1015
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,599
more developed

1016
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,920
all right it looks like that's all the

1017
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,680
questions we have for we're just running

1018
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,079
out of time now too so um just another

1019
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,660
round of applause and thank you

1020
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,790
[Applause]

1021
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,440
you
