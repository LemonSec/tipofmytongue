conference i know you've been going for

58
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,360
longer than that but crucial work that

59
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,079
i've long

60
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,000
admired with the business community with

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,240
higher education and with

62
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,119

speaker

65
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,719
i'm slightly i think i'm pleased that

66
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,000
i'm going before him because he's

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,799
amazing

68
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,038
and but troy hunt is a global cyber

69
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,399
security treasurer

70
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,160
as a teacher now at a university who

71
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,319
teaches cyber security all i really have

72
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,280
to do

73
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,400
is tell students including world leaders

74
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,879
students in executive education programs

75
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,560
to type in their email to have i've been

76
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,239
pummed and then suddenly i've got their

77
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,360
attention

78
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,760
and the other genuinely is to um

79
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,720
australians

80
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,040
um particularly those in government in

81
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,840
um

82
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,000
in government service at the asd and the

83
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,680
australian cyber security center but

84
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,000
many

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,640
other partners as well i had no better

86
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,280
partner i ran uk cyber security for six

87
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,879
and a half years two and a half setting

88
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,959
up the national cyber security center

89
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,239
the other four running it and it was

90
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:48,959
brilliant

91
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,280
um as part of the five eyes learning so

92
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,560
much from australia's

93
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
um expertise and energy

94
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,840
we had our moments i think the uk and

95
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,440
australia are designed to have sometimes

96
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,040
a combustible relationship through time

97
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,560
zones somebody's going to be grumpy

98
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,239
because it's too early or it's too

99
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,400
late or somebody's flown a long way but

100
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,519
we couldn't have any

101
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,200
um better um partner so in the next 25

102
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,959
minutes or so i'm just going to take you

103
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,760
through

104
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,480
the theme of what is an organization

105
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,519
that doesn't exist to do cyber security

106
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,319
supposed to do about it how do we cope

107
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,040
with

108
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,440
all the fear and all the doubt and

109
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,280
the growing um but manageable threat

110
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,440
when we want to be doing something else

111
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,959
we want to be running healthcare we want

112
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,560
to be running businesses

113
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,879
um we want to be running at schools we

114
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,480
just want to be living our lives and the

115
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,440
way we are

116
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,560
and we can't afford always either the

117
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,200
time

118
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,519
or the money just to to make our

119
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,879
organizations about

120
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,680
um cyber security at a time when there's

121
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,640
so much

122
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,200
concern about cyber harm around i mean

123
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,120
look where we are at the minute i doubt

124
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
i haven't been obviously because it's

125
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,680
seven in the morning here

126
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
i haven't been at the rest of the

127
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,760
conference but i suspect the colonial

128
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,360
pipeline uh case has

129
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,519
um has come up look where we are now in

130
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,799
the united states

131
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,439
we have official government advice in

132
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,319
force today

133
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,640
asking people not to panic by gasoline

134
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,720
or petrol as we call it over here

135
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,279
and put it in plastic bags so if you

136
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,839
wanted

137
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,240
an illustration of the impact of cyber

138
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,880
harms

139
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,639
it would be hard to think of a better

140
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,639
one and in a sense this feeds

141
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,600
all those warnings over years over

142
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,680
decades about

143
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,240
about really difficult cyber impacts

144
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,479
cyber wars cybergeddon and all the rest

145
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,120
of it

146
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,360
the fact that these unstoppable what my

147
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
technical director of the national cyber

148
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,280
security center called

149
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,320
winged cyber ninja monkeys um

150
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,400
who were just sitting there in bedrooms

151
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,639
in suburban england suburban australia

152
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,120
teenagers unstoppable hacking everything

153
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,400
and there was nothing we could do to

154
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,440
stop them

155
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,199
and in a sense the panic on the east

156
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,280
coast of the us at the moment seems to

157
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,720
be fueling that narrative

158
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,759
except it's wrong it's absolutely wrong

159
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,520
let's take a look at what's actually

160
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,800
happening in in

161
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,759
in that case we have a bunch of

162
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,560
criminals

163
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
they're in over their heads operating

164
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,320
out of russia they've even issued a

165
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,240
partial apology for what they've done

166
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,000
because what they were trying to do

167
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,199
yet again is exploit basic weaknesses in

168
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,360
corporate security all over the world to

169
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,639
make money

170
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,400
and they've gone too far because what

171
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,320
they didn't realize was that by hacking

172
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,000
the it system

173
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,039
of a pipeline company

174
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,520
that that would then cause the company

175
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,240
for whatever reason to shut down um

176
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,759
the pipeline so you have yet again

177
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,639
an accidental spiraling out of control

178
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,400
just as we've had in the past i'll come

179
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,280
to this

180
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,919
where the um where a series of

181
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,160
structural weaknesses in the way we do

182
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,080
cyber security and the way the market

183
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,840
structure the way our organizations are

184
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,880
incentivized

185
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
has led to a public impact which is very

186
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,639
very

187
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,039
serious that's the bad news the good

188
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,880
news is when you look at the details of

189
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,280
this

190
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,800
and other cases there are things we can

191
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,600
do

192
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,000
about it we need absolutely to demystify

193
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,400
cybersecurity we have to treat it as an

194
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
ordinary um

195
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,440
as an ordinary business um risk

196
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,520
so in a sense what i want to get across

197
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,680
today is that any organization

198
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,199
however big or small whatever it does

199
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,680
has got a bunch of risks that it needs

200
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,600
to manage

201
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,479
the key messages i've got for you today

202
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,680
are

203
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,039
cyber cyber threats cyber risks

204
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,840
they're not catastrophes cyber harms are

205
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,319
the aggregation of small harms

206
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,680
hype fear uncertainty doubt that is our

207
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,639
enemy

208
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,280
what we need to do instead is understand

209
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,400
the who

210
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,520
the why what and the house

211
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,800
of cyber security we need to identify

212
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
the risk in each organization

213
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,280
and manage it accordingly it will differ

214
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,240
between risks

215
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,360
and between organizations and finally

216
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,880
smaller organizations any organizations

217
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,919
can do this so if we could just call up

218
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,479
the

219
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,599
first slide and just put it through what

220
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,160
i've done

221
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
here is because

222
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,840
in my time in government i was so

223
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,880
frustrated with

224
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,000
the whole fear uncertainty and doubt of

225
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
cyber security

226
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
um i don't know if we're getting the

227
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,680
slides up i can't i i i can't see

228
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,639
and because i was so um annoyed with the

229
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,160
fear and certainty and back to cyber

230
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,319
security as soon as i left what i did

231
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,199
was

232
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,720
i drew up a chart

233
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,400
of harm and this wasn't scientific

234
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,520
this wasn't meant to be um

235
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
saying this is all the harm in cyber

236
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,680
security

237
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,240
i was saying in six and a half years

238
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,120
running

239
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
cyber security for a major economy this

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,919
is what i saw

241
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,599
and it's absolutely based on the reality

242
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,000
of everyday cyber security so i don't

243
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,199
know if you can see

244
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,240
a nine box grid a taxonomy of cyber

245
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,440
uh of of of of cyber horn

246
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,639
what you will see in the bottom right is

247
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,320
catastrophic cyber harm

248
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,919
and by that and there's an asterisk

249
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,240
beside that and that's because

250
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,958
that is the one thing that has not

251
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,640
happened

252
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
there have been all sorts of cyber

253
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,760
attacks having many many of them

254
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,880
and the one thing that we can still say

255
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,800
thankfully is that the official death

256
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,240
toll caused by

257
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,880
cyber harms is zero there was a very sad

258
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,360
case

259
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,399
in germany last year where an um

260
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,200
where a patient on a heroic hospital and

261
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,560
had to be diverted to a different

262
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
hospital because of ransomware attack

263
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,399
but the german authorities couldn't

264
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,279
uh causely link to criminal justice

265
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,000
standards

266
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,080
the um um

267
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,399
the death of this patient to this cyber

268
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,399
attack so what we haven't had is the

269
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,080
catastrophic sort of attack what we've

270
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,959
had instead

271
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,519
is this whole state of sight of

272
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,800
categories of harm

273
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,720
caused and these are the ones that i uh

274
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,839
saw in my time

275
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,040
in uh government so what

276
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,360
uh what have we seen instead we've seen

277
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,200
three categories of harm they're called

278
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,760
getting robbed getting weakened and

279
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,399
getting

280
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,399
hurt i'll just walk you through them

281
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,920
quickly pausing on some of them and then

282
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,120
we'll walk through some case studies

283
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,560
because these are the sorts of things

284
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
that happen to real organizations

285
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,920
all the time people get cash stolen from

286
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,640
them

287
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,480
everyone's after cash as they can get

288
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,000
that can range from

289
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,320
first insulin i dealt with as head of

290
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,920
the national cyber security center was

291
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,800
an attempt

292
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,640
to brute force attack our national

293
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,079
lottery here in the uk

294
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,240
in order to get some uh in order to get

295
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,360
some cash

296
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,600
thankfully we managed to stop the attack

297
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,120
i'd like to be able to say they didn't

298
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,399
get away with any money

299
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,800
they actually go away with 13 pounds 50

300
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,959
so in one respect we failed on the other

301
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,600
hand

302
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
given that cyber security is about the

303
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
reduction of harm i'm reasonably happy

304
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,079
uh with that at the other end of the

305
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:24,720
scale

306
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,399
some north korean hackers in 2016

307
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,720
uh hacked the bank of bangladesh through

308
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,519
its um

309
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,200
the end point of the swift into bank

310
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
clearance system and they made off with

311
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
81 million dollars and had it not been

312
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,760
for a mistake in the english language

313
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,120
which alerted um regulators in new york

314
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,560
it would have been 850 million

315
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,160
you get into the more sophisticated

316
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,720
getting rolled you get into ip theft the

317
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,279
chinese state as we'll see in a minute

318
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,440
voraciously seeks the intellectual

319
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,279
property of other countries as part of

320
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,480
its getting rich

321
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,360
um strategy you get into data theft at

322
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,600
an

323
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,480
industrial scale and we need to

324
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,800
understand the different gradations of

325
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,000
data theft

326
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
because there's a huge criminal

327
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,480
underworld that sells and monetizes this

328
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,120
data

329
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,839
so it can match my email all the stuff

330
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,560
on how i've been honed and so forth

331
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,160
with other data sets and seemingly

332
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,800
innocuous innocuous data sets

333
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,480
in that way can get um can become

334
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,920
that valuable but sometimes data theft

335
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,760
is so significant it becomes

336
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,279
strategically

337
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,200
important and that gets into getting

338
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,360
weakened so you look at

339
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,880
in getting weakened this is where

340
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,640
societies as a whole as opposed to

341
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
individuals losing bits of money or

342
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
valuable property or data

343
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,800
societies as a whole get weakened by

344
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,760
strategic

345
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,959
um attacks

346
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,800
so on espionage one of the most

347
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
strategically impactful hacks of all

348
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,440
time

349
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,320
was against the united states in 2015

350
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,040
where

351
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,079
the chinese are believed to have stolen

352
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,959
the entire federal government database

353
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,040
of everyone who applied for

354
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,800
a u.s federal government security

355
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,240
clearance this

356
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,360
century 21 and a half million people and

357
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,320
if you've ever filled out your

358
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,399
government security clearance form and i

359
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,560
have you will know it's not just your

360
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,079
name and email address and maybe a

361
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,680
password in the last four digits of a

362
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,240
bank

363
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,120
card it's absolutely everything about

364
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,760
you

365
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,440
how did they do that they did some

366
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
social engineering they found the

367
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,800
systems administrator

368
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,360
on presumably on linkedin cultivated

369
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,959
that person

370
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,000
guessed some passwords and then spent

371
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,680
more than 24 hours copying the database

372
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,760
without the organization noticing this

373
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,959
massive use

374
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,160
of computing power so you can see

375
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,279
all sorts of red flags here this wasn't

376
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,079
an irresistible attack this is something

377
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,079
where there are various times you can

378
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,320
stop it but look at the strategic harm

379
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,440
that will do

380
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,760
to the us the chilling effect it will

381
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,160
have public servants knowing that a

382
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,399
potentially hostile state has this data

383
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,920
and you see how people can get

384
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,200
weakened we have seen societies

385
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,920
undermined

386
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,519
in the west by interference in elections

387
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,639
through fairly basic cyber attacks and i

388
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,440
know given

389
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,079
the important role that local government

390
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,440
plays in all cert

391
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,720
and the important role that local

392
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,040
government plays in

393
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,440
[Music]

394
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,560
in um election administration that's a

395
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
huge interest but of course these are

396
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,160
small organizations that need to know

397
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,680
how to protect themselves

398
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,760
we see pre-positioning that's when

399
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,399
states just menacingly put down

400
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,160
intrusions into energy companies

401
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
telecoms companies why are they there we

402
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,880
don't know

403
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,199
but it's a useful bridgehead if there's

404
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,800
a time of tension

405
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,040
so you go from getting robbed you go

406
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,399
from getting weakened

407
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,320
and then there are times where societies

408
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,240
get hurt they suffer disruptive

409
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,240
um damage and destructive um attacks

410
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,560
many of these like colonial pipelines

411
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,920
are seemingly

412
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,360
accidental in the summer of 2017 in fact

413
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,279
four years ago today

414
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,040
um on the uh um towards the end of the

415
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,519
week

416
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,240
i was traveling home or called to go

417
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,360
back to london

418
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,120
because our hospital booking systems

419
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,959
weren't working why

420
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,600
seemingly they were being extorted by

421
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,560
unknown

422
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,360
actors i remember thinking why is anyone

423
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,040
trying to extort the british national

424
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,480
health service it's what the one

425
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,320
organization that famously

426
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,959
is frequently short of um money and

427
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,320
isn't the light and it's one of the most

428
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,560
scrutinized organizations in the world

429
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,399
it turns out it was the north koreans

430
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,760
trying to steal more money as they've

431
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,320
done from bangladesh

432
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,480
at the bank of bangladesh but their

433
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,839
ransomware attack had gone out of

434
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,240
control it had gone viral

435
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,399
and had disrupted not just the booking

436
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,600
systems in the british

437
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,760
national health service but had taken

438
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,639
out the um

439
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,560
the notifications of german railway

440
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,639
platforms the following month the

441
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,000
russians attacked a professional

442
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,880
services firm

443
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,519
in ukraine and ended up disrupting and

444
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,040
i'm not making this up you can check it

445
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,000
given it's close

446
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,240
given it's in no run disrupting

447
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,360
production

448
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,040
for a while at a chocolate factory in

449
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,199
tasmania which i'm sure was not central

450
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,040
to the russia ukraine

451
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,320
tensions so these destructive um

452
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,399
attacks happen and they're often linked

453
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,120
to the scourge of ransomware

454
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
so let's just look at this in the round

455
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,680
what do we have

456
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,759
we this is the reality of cyber harms

457
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,279
it's not glamorous it's not

458
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,320
individual catastrophes it's all sorts

459
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,880
of

460
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,759
nebulous pernicious nasty little

461
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,320
incidents exploiting basic weaknesses to

462
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,839
add up to a big

463
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,639
big social problem so that's the what's

464
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,079
happening let's have a look at the next

465
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,759
slide very quickly

466
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,480
who's doing it well if you're a western

467
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,440
country

468
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,279
and like us um we face four nation-state

469
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,680
attackers and it's easy to put the flags

470
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,880
up there of china

471
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,199
russia iran and north korea but they all

472
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,959
are very different

473
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,880
i'm not telling you this just because i

474
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,240
think it's interesting although

475
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,839
i hope it is um it's because

476
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,399
we need to think about how to manage

477
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,120
risk

478
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,560
and to manage risk you need to think

479
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
about who might be attacking

480
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,519
you so let's take china and russia to

481
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,560
very

482
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,920
often malevolent actors on the global

483
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,160
internet um but they have very different

484
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,279
motivations

485
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,480
so the history of china's um

486
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,279
cyber attack capability has been

487
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,440
primarily not exclusively but primarily

488
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,320
economic

489
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,480
get rich quick rapid economic

490
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,880
development to steal other people's ip

491
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,240
of course global espionage is also of

492
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,560
interest to them and increasingly as

493
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,680
we've seen with

494
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,160
um all the debates about supply chains

495
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,920
and so forth increasingly china's moving

496
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,880
beyond

497
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,240
cyber um intrusions and towards actual

498
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,319
technological dominance of tech markets

499
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,359
which is a different

500
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,000
um problem so that's the way you think

501
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,679
about china have i got something

502
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,720
valuable

503
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,959
am i strategically important in terms of

504
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,240
intellectual property

505
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,520
or even you know well i will a chinese

506
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,439
state bank company want to buy me up

507
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,880
because i'm strategically

508
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,919
important russia is different russia is

509
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,760
trying to gain traditional geopolitical

510
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,199
advantage so it's much more interested

511
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,720
in political interference

512
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,440
much more it's much more interested in

513
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,000
for example

514
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
russian distance abroad it's much more

515
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,640
interested in intrusions into

516
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,120
strategically important sectors like

517
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,160
energy and

518
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,559
and so forth and so for example if

519
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,720
you're a big global law firm

520
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,160
and you're looking at the states

521
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,000
managing the state's threats from china

522
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,360
and russia

523
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
we say well i have lots of mergers and

524
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,440
acquisitions and intellectual property

525
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,640
well that's what china will be

526
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,360
interested in um but i don't have any

527
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,280
russian oligarchs who have tensions with

528
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,799
president putin on my books

529
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,559
well if you do russia will be interested

530
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,640
in that and that's a different way of

531
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,799
defending so we need to work out

532
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,160
understanding what you've got

533
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,840
and what a state actor might be

534
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,720
interested in iran and north korea

535
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,400
have both got rudimentary capabilities

536
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,600
but high risk appetite so

537
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
there are numerous examples of

538
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
organizations or countries

539
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,799
annoying the iranians and then

540
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,799
retaliating with cyber intrusions

541
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,640
including destructive

542
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,919
ones like um ddos attacks on american

543
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,120
banks or attacks on saudi oil companies

544
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,880
which go beyond what they'd be prepared

545
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,480
to do in the

546
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,600
physical world similarly with north

547
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,200
um and korea who famously hacked sony

548
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,960
and embarrassed george clooney and other

549
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,480
celebrities but also caused real

550
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,760
problems to the

551
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,039
um real problems to the company but are

552
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:55,440
now

553
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,760
actually become the world's first in the

554
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,840
words of the us department of justice

555
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,080
state sponsored cyber criminal because

556
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,520
they're desperate for money so they're

557
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,280
trying to disrupt financial systems in

558
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,720
australia in the uk

559
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,360
and everywhere else so those are the

560
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,880
state attackers there are others who are

561
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,400
trying to get into that

562
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,240
but the biggest biggest biggest threat

563
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
to everyone is on the next slide

564
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,280
which is international that's organized

565
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,559
cyber crime and the colonial pipeline

566
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,320
intrusion has shown this

567
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,640
to be um has shown the way this works

568
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,200
this is a service these are not terribly

569
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,640
sophisticated technically although

570
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,760
they're not bad

571
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,919
but they're well organized and they're

572
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,520
not single monolithic

573
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,160
beasts they pay other people they pay on

574
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,919
this slide they pay data miners

575
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,840
intrusion specialists money launderers

576
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,120
people who've got something to do

577
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,400
with um with cyber security now what you

578
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,360
don't have

579
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,679
on this slide are terrorist groups they

580
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,160
haven't developed cyber um

581
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,640
capabilities you don't have all powerful

582
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,679
hackers sitting

583
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,280
in their um in their bedrooms

584
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,400
what you have basically is two sets of

585
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,960
things

586
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,240
you have state attackers and you have um

587
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,600
criminals who are causing all of this

588
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,400
problem and again they're doing it

589
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,360
through largely

590
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,000
basic exploitation so if you look at the

591
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,159
next slide in one of the examples

592
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,799
this is one of the most impactful

593
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,039
economic espionage cases of all time so

594
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:25,919
you look at the top

595
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,320
wanted by the fbi in the top 10 at the

596
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,880
time very sort of glamorous

597
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,799
hack by the chinese into the managed

598
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,559
service providers the i.t services

599
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,159
company on whom most of the western

600
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:38,960
world's

601
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,840
um i.t services um uh depend

602
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,159
the fbi director uh christopher wray

603
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,240
called this the a to z

604
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
of american business where among the

605
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,400
victims there's a huge global campaign

606
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,840
of corporate espionage

607
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,280
damage is incalculable and

608
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,760
i'm worthy of an fbi poster let's look

609
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,960
how it was done

610
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,480
the bottom left you've got the melissa

611
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,360
virus it's from the year 2000

612
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,600
and the way that this intrusion um

613
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,360
started in japan it may not be the start

614
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,640
of the whole intrusion

615
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,880
was that um some word attachments

616
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,799
running macros with the melissa virus in

617
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,240
them were sent and opened by some

618
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,320
japanese business executives

619
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,799
it's not their fault any version any

620
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,480
modern version of windows would have

621
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,240
stopped it but it wasn't there

622
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,840
and then on the right we've got the quiz

623
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,600
our remote access trojan which sounds

624
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,360
very glamorous but you can buy that off

625
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,159
the internet

626
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,799
you can buy that for 700 pounds or 700

627
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,080
sorry us dollars

628
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,480
you can get a training manual for it but

629
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,360
it was able to

630
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,159
roam across from japan on unsegmented

631
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,280
networks

632
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,799
freely for months undetected

633
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,440
so a very very strategically impactful

634
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,159
um

635
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,919
hack worked off very very basic

636
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,120
capabilities

637
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,600
similarly on the next slide two big

638
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,720
intrusions

639
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,080
into um us and british politics the us

640
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,600
one being much bigger and much more

641
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,280
famous against secretary clinton

642
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,919
in 2016. below secretary clinton is one

643
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,840
of her aides john podesta and the way

644
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,960
the russians did that

645
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,360
firstly they hacked into the server of

646
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,039
the democratic national committee that's

647
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,320
a small

648
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,880
organization and then they hacked into

649
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,960
the gmail of mr podesta and then they

650
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,640
just did a data dump

651
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,080
similarly in the 2019 general election

652
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,840
these are two british politicians liam

653
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,200
fox conservative

654
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,280
trade minister at the time and jeremy

655
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,640
corbyn then the leader of the labour

656
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,520
party

657
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,240
and someone in mr dr fox's department

658
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,000
sent an email to a gmail so they could

659
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,520
work on it offline because they didn't

660
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,159
like this

661
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,640
safe remote working stuff and that ended

662
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,159
up um

663
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,200
being a very controversial election uh

664
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,799
leak uh where um documents about the

665
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,840
relationship between

666
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,280
um the apart the alleged privatization

667
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,039
of health care and post brexit trade

668
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,159
deals became a big

669
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,039
uh talking point so very very basic

670
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,480
security lapses

671
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,520
leading to quite high impact and stuff

672
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
in the next slide we see some of the um

673
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,799
interesting points about critical

674
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,159
infrastructure and we're going to be

675
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,840
talking about this more and more

676
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,400
after the pipeline i hear i think we

677
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,080
have to think about getting

678
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,520
getting security right as well as safety

679
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,600
english is a very interesting language

680
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
because it's got separate words for

681
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,120
security and safety and most european

682
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
languages have the same words of urad

683
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,600
and

684
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,159
spanish security and french and so forth

685
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,159
and we're actually quite good at safety

686
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,840
so look at colonial pipelines

687
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
everything's been switched off safely

688
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
it's just because of insecurity major

689
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,679
disruptions happening but if you look at

690
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,559
the left

691
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,640
this is this fascinating case from only

692
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,080
january this year

693
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,840
in a small town called oldsmar in

694
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,200
florida where

695
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,760
somebody believed to be a disgruntled

696
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,960
employee

697
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,480
actually hacked into the remote working

698
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,279
facility

699
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,080
for a water treatment plant in the city

700
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,840
of wolves morgan

701
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,080
and somehow managed to use that

702
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,440
compromise to start

703
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,760
changing the chemical composition of the

704
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,880
drinking water

705
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,640
so this is disastrous that that can

706
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,919
happen the good

707
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,400
news is that there were multiple checks

708
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,440
on um the water going out ph checks

709
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
uh other uh checks so it didn't come

710
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,640
close

711
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,039
to affecting anybody and that's so

712
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,799
that's an example of bad practice in

713
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,559
that in the first instance

714
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,240
the water should never have allowed to

715
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,840
be altered through remote

716
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,480
and access but good practice and there's

717
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,279
that resilience that non-cyber

718
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,240
resilience which gets us through and

719
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
that is why

720
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,880
if you look at the book title on the

721
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,120
right about click here to kill everybody

722
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,440
we're actually containing some cyber

723
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,159
threats

724
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,000
into disruption rather than real harm

725
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,919
so in understanding these harms and

726
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,440
understanding how our systems work and

727
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,840
the relationship between cyber and

728
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,520
non-cyber we get to the positive stories

729
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,120
which is the last sort of

730
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,559
war story um if you go to the next slide

731
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,760
about how we can try to contain this

732
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,600
so everyone's talking about ransomware

733
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,679
and it's a disaster and it is

734
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,320
we need to do more but let's be

735
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,159
optimistic there's some really really

736
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,360
good examples

737
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,880
of good practice here so this is a

738
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,799
polish company called project red

739
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,480
they got ransomware but they had good

740
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,240
backups

741
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,440
they had a good incident response plan

742
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
so what they did was they kept going and

743
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,520
they announced they'd been ransomward

744
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,039
and they announced they weren't going to

745
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,200
pay it they wrote to the customer saying

746
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,640
look apologies if these

747
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,799
criminals leak the data but we will do

748
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,320
everything we can to contain

749
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,799
the harm and they publish the technical

750
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,799
details of the attack so security

751
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,400
researchers could have a go with these

752
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,200
people

753
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,159
so it's not all bad and it's not all

754
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:52,880
doom

755
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,080
and gloom we need to think about

756
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,000
protections and we need to think about

757
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,520
getting protections right so i'm going

758
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,279
to give you a quick example

759
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,200
before we finish about how to get

760
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,480
protections wrong

761
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,559
and then right so if we look at the next

762
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,240
slide

763
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,919
so much of this and so much of what

764
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,840
we've been talking about has been about

765
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,559
passwords sorry has been about basics

766
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,320
and basic accesses and one of those

767
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,520
things has been about password

768
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,279
compromises it's come up with various

769
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,159
points including

770
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,840
the chinese attack on the american

771
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,240
database

772
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,520
so here's some mathematical

773
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,760
approximations about how to

774
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,480
um compromise a password so if you have

775
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,559
something very basic just a few letters

776
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,640
it can be done instantly by a hacker

777
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
then if you do something very

778
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
sophisticated as in the bottom right

779
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,559
where you've got your special characters

780
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,240
letters numbers uppercase store cases

781
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,279
will take you sort of

782
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,880
quadrillion years so everybody goes

783
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,480
great we're going to have long complex

784
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,240
passwords

785
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,120
unfortunately um when you have to have

786
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,919
separate ones for every uh account

787
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,720
then um and they all have to meet that

788
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,050
um

789
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,960
[Music]

790
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,279
that sort of gold standard criteria what

791
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,159
happens is

792
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,039
the next slide and in the next slide

793
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,080
that is 600

794
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,400
digits i have the uk sorry just go to

795
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
the previous one just to 600 digits

796
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,480
at the previous slide uh sorry i um

797
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,159
and at my previous job at the national

798
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,080
cyber security center

799
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,360
and we got a professor of psychology

800
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,960
to compute what we were asking the

801
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,640
average person to do with passwords and

802
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,240
she came back and said we're asking

803
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,080
people to do the mathematical to do the

804
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,760
mental equivalent of learning

805
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,720
a new 600 digit number every month it's

806
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,399
crazy and people count

807
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,159
people can't do it so by looking at

808
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,320
too narrow an aspect of the problem what

809
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,399
makes for a strong password we're asking

810
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,840
people to do the impossible

811
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,039
when people are asked to do the

812
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,200
impossible they take shortcuts when

813
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,480
people take shortcuts

814
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,120
hacks happen so look instead and if we

815
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,399
go to the next slide

816
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,159
this is now what the national cyber

817
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,000
security center in the uk

818
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,279
by australia um uh uh similar in

819
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,720
australia similar in the us

820
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,760
now he's saying use sensible password

821
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,919
policy use password managers

822
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,559
organization should allow people to

823
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:08,960
paste

824
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,080
passwords into um websites

825
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,399
through password managers because that

826
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,799
is sensible risk management i have one

827
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,399
master password

828
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,440
that you can sensibly um

829
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
learn and protect because that is the

830
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,720
keys to

831
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,240
the kingdom this is why

832
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,960
just as i begin to conclude the overall

833
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,880
approach if we go to the next slide has

834
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,679
to be one

835
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,600
of risk management so homework

836
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,919
don't just tell people that when they

837
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:40,960
work from home

838
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,200
they have to um make sure they don't

839
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,000
click on links

840
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,760
give them good equipment give them vpns

841
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,679
make sure they know bring your own

842
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,679
device and all the rest of it

843
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,799
so you don't have crazy outcomes such as

844
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,720
the one in the water plant

845
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
and an aggregate if we go to the next

846
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,480
slide

847
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,840
which is crucial i'll probably um uh

848
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,200
finish on this um manage risk well

849
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,760
at organizational level board

850
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,120
leaderships whether that's

851
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,760
a charity a university a local

852
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,399
government

853
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,320
national government small business big

854
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,080
business boards

855
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,880
need to understand a little bit about

856
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,159
cyber security now

857
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,720
they need to get a little bit technical

858
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,559
they need to know the sorts of hacks

859
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,640
that happen as in that nine box grid

860
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,240
that i showed everywhere

861
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,799
that i showed earlier and they need to

862
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,679
be able

863
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,159
to have an informed conversation about

864
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:36,799
that

865
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,640
i used to when i was in government i

866
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,080
used to enjoy teasing

867
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,159
oil company executives when they'd say

868
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,320
the cyber security stuff it's very scary

869
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,039
and i don't really

870
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,080
understand it might take them you can

871
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,799
extract

872
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,440
fossil fuels from the seabed safely and

873
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,720
economically

874
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,480
and get them transported although not

875
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,840
this week in america

876
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,279
get them transported um to consumers and

877
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,080
businesses

878
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,120
all over all over the world you can

879
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
manage enormously complicated health and

880
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,799
safety risks you can manage enormously

881
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,399
complicated financial risks

882
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,000
but if i mention computer network

883
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,880
security too easy it's too complicated

884
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,480
you wouldn't have a board member of

885
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,320
sitting out of discussion on pension

886
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,159
liability saying well i'm afraid i have

887
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,440
nothing to say here i don't really

888
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,600
understand that the same has to be true

889
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,880
at cyber security and so in this

890
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,960
this is a summary of the national cyber

891
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,039
security center's board toolkit which is

892
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,279
the sort of conversation organizations

893
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,320
need to be having

894
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,159
and as we know have we done a cyber

895
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,840
security risk assessment oh good

896
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,520
an expensive company has done that

897
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,320
before us it's

898
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,760
it's conversations like this

899
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,320
assuming that somebody's going to click

900
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,480
on a dodgy link because we can't expect

901
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,320
people who are busy with other things to

902
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,279
spot everything

903
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,360
how are we going to manage the fact that

904
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,960
people get into our network

905
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,559
how are we going to manage not being the

906
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,159
next colonial pipeline how are we going

907
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,679
to notice this

908
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,679
are we going to notice this intrusion

909
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,679
it's stuff like that it's who is our

910
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,360
systems administrator

911
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,399
what is how big is their team

912
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,399
and how are we protecting those people

913
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,080
who are more important strategically

914
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,080
in cyber security than the chief

915
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,519
executive or the

916
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,760
chair so i would encourage people have a

917
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,120
look at the australian government's

918
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,720
guidance british government's guidance

919
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,080
all freely available

920
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,000
and just manage risk well enough

921
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,440
you don't need to have nation state

922
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,799
defenses so we just lose the slides for

923
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,240
the last minute or two

924
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,679
it's very easy to be terrified of cyber

925
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:42,640
security

926
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,000
it's very easy to be infantilized

927
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,200
by cyber risks and the hype around

928
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,559
cyber security but there are

929
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,080
good news stories firstly no one is

930
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,279
asking small organizations universities

931
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,039
local government no one's asking them to

932
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,399
be able to take on

933
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,480
the best of a hostile nation state the

934
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,080
best of the chinese state

935
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,200
on their own if you get

936
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,679
targeted and not many do but some do by

937
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,440
one of those elite actors

938
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,559
then you're entitled to government and

939
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,159
help that's what national security is

940
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,320
so for example where i now work in the

941
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,760
university of oxford

942
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,600
a small research institute called the

943
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,279
general institute suddenly became the

944
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,640
center of world attention because it

945
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,919
turned out they've got quite

946
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,200
quite a few good people who were

947
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
excellent at making cheap coronavirus

948
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,159
vaccines

949
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,080
and that became the subject of the

950
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,240
world's um

951
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,679
tension including the attention of some

952
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,760
of the most hostile actors

953
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,440
so the uk government helped that

954
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,200
organization protect itself because it

955
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,320
was too small

956
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,799
to do it and it's a small medical

957
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,039
research facility not a cyber security

958
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,320
facility

959
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,840
but the final story because i've given

960
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,200
you all these stories of things going

961
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,000
wrong

962
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,919
i would like to pay tribute to them to

963
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,440
our american friends

964
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,200
in what they did to protect the election

965
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,159
of 2020 from outside cyber interference

966
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,720
look at the legacy of 2016 and how toxic

967
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,600
that proved

968
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,279
look what they did in 2020 they got

969
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,919
the state and local governments together

970
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,840
they got all the major agencies together

971
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,760
they got all the businesses together

972
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,559
and it meant that tiny organizations in

973
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,399
rural states like nebraska and the

974
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,159
dakotas and so forth

975
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,960
actually knew how to manage cyber risk

976
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,000
effectively

977
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,240
knew how their systems work knew how

978
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,440
resilient

979
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,559
um to be and how to achieve that

980
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,320
resilience knew how to share

981
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,880
that information and they did that

982
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,200
through a well-informed partnership

983
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,559
between government federal government

984
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,760
local government

985
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,559
businesses ngos and so forth and the

986
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,320
sort of partnerships that all certainly

987
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,080
have been fermenting over the last 20

988
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,399
years

989
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,120
are ideally suited to meet these

990
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,240
challenges

991
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,799
so understand the harms

992
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,720
have a risk-based approach a realistic

993
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,440
approach

994
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,239
and work with partners and we can get on

995
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,599
top of this problem

996
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,280
thank you very much for listening to me

997
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,119
this afternoon and enjoy the rest of

998
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,839
this great event

999
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,000
professor kieran professor kieran martin

1000
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,199
thank you so much for that karen can i

1001
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,480
just ask you one

1002
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,960
quick question and ask this as a

1003
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,119
conference mc who's a bit of an outsider

1004
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,079
to this space

1005
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,320
but i hear about the um the the you know

1006
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,760
the big events you're talking about of

1007
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,119
recent times there's seem to have been

1008
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,320
four or five really

1009
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,440
high profile hack events recently but

1010
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,079
then again you take us back to 2015

1011
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,480
for that massive case of cyber espionage

1012
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,679
so

1013
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,399
is it a particularly hot patch at the

1014
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,440
moment or is this

1015
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,040
just business as usual

1016
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,800
we've had a number of reminders we've

1017
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,119
had a big spying intrusion in the us

1018
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,040
from so-called solarwinds case and

1019
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,960
another one from chinese on

1020
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
microsoft again in the us we've had the

1021
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,640
water plant incident and now we've had

1022
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,760
the colonial

1023
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,520
pipelines disruption and the good news

1024
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,800
for people like us is that they're all

1025
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,240
in the united states

1026
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,400
it reminds me of uh when i sent my

1027
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,520
deputy to a

1028
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,880
conference i don't think it was all cert

1029
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,160
but i sent him to a conference in

1030
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,880
australia

1031
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,119
and he was um saying the same thing this

1032
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,560
will often he was saying the same thing

1033
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,680
as i was saying about

1034
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,520
you to manage risk be good enough you

1035
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,680
don't have to see off every attack

1036
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,160
um and he said my job is not to send

1037
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,119
them

1038
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,119
is not to stop all cyber crimes to send

1039
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,400
it to france

1040
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,839
unfortunately um you know this being the

1041
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,760
global internet age this got back to my

1042
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,040
french counterpart

1043
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
and is it getting worse i think it's

1044
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,480
actually steady but i think we're

1045
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,560
becoming more aware of the impact

1046
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,760
um and i think it's variable so i

1047
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,040
think that um we the lesson

1048
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,200
of the last while and the lesson of the

1049
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,119
last six months is that it's glaringly

1050
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,119
exposed to a much bigger audience the

1051
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,800
fundamental weaknesses and things like

1052
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,079
supply chains

1053
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,880
you know why is one company which turns

1054
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,839
out was

1055
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,599
its updates were poisoned by russian

1056
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,440
state actors why is one company

1057
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,960
supplying half of the most important

1058
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,400
federal governments in the world

1059
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,839
without checks and supply chains and

1060
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,359
that's why president by michigan

1061
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,480
executive order

1062
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,440
trying to solve that problem last night

1063
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,040
so i think what we've had

1064
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,200
um are a series of more visible

1065
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,839
exposures of non-existing problems

1066
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,839
so don't despair and there's stuff we

1067
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:26,960
can do

1068
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,320
fantastic please give professor kiran

1069
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,440
