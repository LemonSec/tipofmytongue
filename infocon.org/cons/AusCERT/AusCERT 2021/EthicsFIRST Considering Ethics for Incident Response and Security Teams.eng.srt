1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,280
interests are in the developing ethics

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,560
of cyber security

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,120
and we also have sean who is a senior

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,960
program manager in a wide variety of

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,240
business applications at

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,280
nvidia she is particularly experienced

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,440
in incident response software security

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,520
privacy compliance and release

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,640
management

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,760
specialities include incident response

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,279
security program management privacy

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,960
program management software compliance

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,640
and payments compliance

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,400
so they're both oh i can see them now

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,320
hello uh so they're both going to be

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,079
talking about ethics first

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,920
considering ethics for incident response

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,280
and security teams

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,040
so we can give them a very very warm

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,879
welcome all the way

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,559
from oh i assume one of them's from

22
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,680
netherlands i have no idea where the

23
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,960
other one is but thank you

my name is sean i am being into you live

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,840
from seattle washington so

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,200
uh right before my bedtime um so today

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,479
we're gonna be talking a little bit

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:08,799
about

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,280
ethics for security teams we're kind of

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,479
gonna go over and give you a little

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,439
insight into

36
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,799
how we came up with this and why uh

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,280
go over the uh the pillars the duties

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,560
that we've come up with

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,640
and some of the challenges that we see

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,119
uh facing security teams and how a code

41
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,479
of ethics like this

42
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,360
we believe can help um as we go through

43
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,000
this if

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,079
you have questions you know let us know

45
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,520
and we'll be happy to

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,000
address anything that you have and with

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,720
that if you can skip to the universe

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,479
excellent so the the the horrible part

49
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,000
about all this is i would much rather be

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,439
in australia with you guys than hanging

51
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,720
out it looks like you'll ever have a

52
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,759
great dinner tonight

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,159
and i'm really missing out the other

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,680
part is you're missing the fact that i'm

55
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,000
about

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,799
two feet shorter than your own uh so

57
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,880
we're quite prepared on stage

58
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,759
uh uh we are co-chairs of the ethics

59
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,960
city that's a special

60
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,880
interest group at the forum of install

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,000
response and security teams

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,360
both of us have been participating there

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,760
for quite a bit and i am currently

64
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
a board member so i'll let you talk a

65
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,319
little bit

66
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,840
yeah so um good morning indeed it's very

67
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
early in the netherlands and i'm

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,040
i'm joining your adversary uh

69
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,959
small correction to my introduction i

70
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,080
used to be at the university of

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,000
amsterdam at university of delft i'm now

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,480
with the

73
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,079
the university of twin

74
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,440
but other than that we're all good um i

75
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,400
saw

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,239
some discussions on slack about wi-fi

77
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,760
passwords and and

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,280
network uh performance and i i long for

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,840
those

80
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,440
those days that i could experience that

81
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,160
again um

82
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,360
but um today we're we're here to talk

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,000
about the

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,200
ethics first um

85
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,080
we uh let's so let's see the

86
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,599
introduction we started with

87
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,280
a uh with a birds of a feather session

88
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,200
in 2016 uh there was just a very small

89
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,599
group

90
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,680
of mostly senior people who were

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,319
starting to realize that

92
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,120
cyber security was growing and and it

93
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,640
was growing

94
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,680
at a at a very fast rate um

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,480
uh first the first conference was was

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,360
growing a lot

97
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,040
uh there were over a thousand

98
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,720
participants or

99
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,159
close to that at least um

100
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,159
and we were starting to realize that

101
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,480
that um

102
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,599
the the informal part of uh

103
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,080
of cyber security uh and insulin

104
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,440
response was not

105
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,239
was no longer working and we needed to

106
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:46,879
make the

107
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,640
the implicit explicit so we we needed to

108
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,560
we felt that we needed to develop a code

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
of ethics and

110
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,879
we started with a small group of people

111
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,159
um

112
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,200
and now we we have a dozen of duties

113
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,599
um uh sean joined in along the way and

114
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,120
i'm very happy that she joined

115
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,640
um uh and many other people have joined

116
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
uh so that we've gotten a very

117
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,319
international input

118
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,760
uh on all of these duties one thing i

119
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,680
i have to say we're still techies at

120
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,798
heart so we

121
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,720
we use in our introduction we refer to

122
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,960
the idea for the rfcs

123
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,639
and the idea of all of these duties is

124
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,639
that they're recommended

125
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,919
as as we state in in rfc so you you

126
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,680
really should be doing these

127
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,360
um and there's there's um

128
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,000
you should be taking this with um if you

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,560
don't

130
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,080
do this you have you have to have a

131
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,000
valid reason for it for not doing

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,880
it you have to be able to explain it and

133
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,080
that's a little bit of how

134
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,120
we um how we look at these dodies

135
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,360
and and of course we can we realize that

136
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,440
they conflict and we'll get to that

137
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,560
at the end uh

138
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,000
with that uh so the basis of the of

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
the whole code of ethics is the next one

140
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,199
the the

141
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,240
trustworthiness um

142
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,800
the whole basis of of instant response

143
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,560
and working together

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,720
is that we have to have a level of trust

145
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
and casey just referred to

146
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,360
the trust levels this is also a function

147
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,639
of um of

148
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,759
first to create that network uh

149
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,320
to to create those relationships um

150
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,039
and to set a bar of what it is that we

151
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,880
expect from one another

152
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,759
and um all of these duties that we've

153
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,479
described

154
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,479
they they build on top of that they try

155
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,479
to create that trustworthiness that

156
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,320
that community sends and

157
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,600
that predictability in how you behave

158
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,240
and what we can expect from each other

159
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,960
one of those is of course the duty of

160
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,360
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

161
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
this is something that we have a lot of

162
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,319
experience with in the netherlands

163
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,360
because we're one of the

164
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,759
few countries that that actually has a

165
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,960
legal framework for this um but this

166
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,800
this tradition of vulnerability

167
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,240
disclosure is of course much

168
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,240
older than um than that and it's been

169
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,759
around in the

170
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,199
incident response inside the security

171
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,639
community for a very long time and

172
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,080
everybody appreciates the value

173
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,160
of this um and so this is why we've

174
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,360
taken this up

175
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,280
uh as a duty for for instant responders

176
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
to coordinate vulnerability disclosures

177
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,039
to coordinate your actions so that we

178
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:33,520
don't

179
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,880
collide into each other and

180
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,400
we should minimize harm and we should be

181
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,919
very clear on the timelines

182
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
and the release of information to

183
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,520
minimize the risk and impact to the

184
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,479
users and

185
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,840
and to our constituency

186
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,440
and with that i'll hand it over to sean

187
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,080
awesome thank you so on to the next

188
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,199
slide where we start talking about

189
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,400
confidentiality

190
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,120
um this really ties into quite a bit

191
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,680
with the

192
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,840
what we were talking about with the cbd

193
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,120
earlier

194
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,319
you know we have to be able to

195
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,960
to respect the request for

196
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,160
confidentiality you know

197
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,840
if you get somebody who's sending

198
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,199
something into you

199
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,560
you want to make sure that you can

200
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
let them know you're going to keep it

201
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,479
confidential you let them know when

202
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,840
you will be able to publish the

203
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,039
information and set their expectations

204
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,280
now again there's there's always some

205
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,479
great errors and they're going to be

206
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,840
sometimes where you can't

207
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,120
respect uh one of the things we

208
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,800
we suggest is trying to be transparent

209
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,599
when that comes up so if you are going

210
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,400
to

211
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,240
have to break embargo for whatever

212
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,160
reason if you're going to

213
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,400
you know have to alert another vendor

214
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,599
whatever it is

215
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,680
our recommendation would be to try and

216
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,319
be as transparent as you possibly can

217
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,800
with the

218
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,599
yeah so this is also an area where

219
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,919
the background of me and and sean are

220
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,199
very different because i'm in a

221
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,039
governmental organization

222
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,039
and there's just rules and laws that i

223
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,800
have to live up to and

224
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,160
i know about them so i can be

225
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,919
transparent about them and i can warn

226
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,199
you about them

227
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,120
um and that situation is slightly

228
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,400
different for sean

229
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,840
for example this is true companies tend

230
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,279
to run a little differently but

231
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,120
you know companies fall under uh

232
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,719
different jurisdictions as well

233
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,719
we'll get a little more into that as we

234
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,880
go

235
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,959
uh for example if you go out to most

236
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,720
of the vendors that we work with they

237
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,320
will state that they follow

238
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
coordinated volatile disclosure they set

239
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,080
your expectations on how they will

240
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,240
follow embargo and things of that nature

241
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
and it's just a good practice to have

242
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,440
that public information

243
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,240
out there so let's go ahead and go on to

244
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,680
the next slide

245
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,200
and then we'll talk a little bit about

246
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,959
acknowledging so

247
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,320
i have seen this one bite teams before

248
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,680
um it sounds so easy and so basic

249
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,240
somebody submits information to you and

250
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,320
you acknowledge you perceived it

251
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,200
sounds very easy it's amazing how often

252
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
it doesn't happen

253
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,959
sometimes it's because it's teens maybe

254
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,040
don't have their incident response team

255
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,440
set

256
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,720
up or it's decentralized or the person

257
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,399
who's receiving the information doesn't

258
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,480
know what to do with it

259
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,560
things can happen for different reasons

260
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,920
uh occasionally you'll just have

261
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,720
something

262
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,519
you know we all get busy and your email

263
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,399
box is full

264
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,760
and you didn't quite get to that day's

265
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,120
email attendance that you should have

266
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
whatever it is again we do highly

267
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,320
recommend

268
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,760
having timely responses even if it's

269
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,160
hey we've received your email thanks for

270
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,440
writing in

271
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,760
my preference is it not be a can stand

272
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,600
but if that's what works

273
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
you know for you that's what works at

274
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,040
least i will know my email

275
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,200
my communication has gotten through to

276
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,399
you

277
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,800
confirm what you're going to do and then

278
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,240
set expectations

279
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,079
you know am i not going to hear from you

280
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,440
for another month because

281
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,279
it's busy and you're in lockdown for

282
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,279
something or can i expect to hear back

283
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,360
from you within the next few weeks

284
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,279
by setting that expectation with me it

285
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,880
will let me know

286
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,720
uh you know when do i need to pay you or

287
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,240
not hearing that from you

288
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,959
um i've had occurrences in the past with

289
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,880
other teams where

290
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,680
somebody got to let the communication go

291
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,640
sale

292
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,680
and the researcher got very upset

293
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,320
and started uh tweeting that they were

294
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,839
going to zero day to that company

295
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,760
because they couldn't get a response

296
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,600
that's certainly that response quickly

297
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,240
but definitely not a positive one on

298
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,760
either side so

299
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,120
by acknowledging and setting

300
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,440
expectations it helps to

301
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,360
maintain those relationships and

302
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
hopefully maintain them in a positive

303
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,959
manner

304
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,160
and now we'll go on to the next slide

305
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,399
yeah to add to the previous one it

306
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,600
doesn't matter if you

307
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
if you can't live up to the expectation

308
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,519
but at least be transparent about it

309
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,480
and and just let people know that you're

310
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,519
aware that you had

311
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,760
you you promised something you're not

312
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,200
going to make it and then just tell

313
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,040
people

314
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,800
and it makes a whole lot of difference

315
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,880
um and it just builds upon

316
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,959
the trust level that we need to uh

317
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,440
that we need to build up and maintain um

318
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,480
so the the next duty um is the duty of

319
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,519
authorization

320
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,120
and um i mentioned before we all have

321
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,399
very different teams

322
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,399
we have different constituencies we have

323
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,079
different um

324
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,920
stakes that we represent and um

325
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,839
we have to be aware of how our actions

326
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,959
our constituents our users

327
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,399
um and we have to ensure that we don't

328
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,839
cause them additional harm

329
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,959
while we're doing things for them or

330
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,560
to them we need sometimes we need to

331
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,880
uh uh we need to do forensics

332
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,000
uh investigations within the network or

333
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,200
or somewhere or other and you have to

334
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,920
have

335
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,240
make sure that you you have uh

336
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,040
authorization before you enter there

337
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,720
and and make sure that you're you're

338
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,160
only doing what you're supposed to be

339
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,480
doing

340
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,160
um this also slides in with the next

341
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,440
duty that's the

342
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,160
duty to inform whenever you're doing

343
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,639
something

344
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,040
on behalf of your constituents or

345
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,000
something that's

346
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,279
that may impact your

347
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,360
your constituents or your user you have

348
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,200
to inform them

349
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,880
and you should also

350
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,440
be aware that inter-responders and

351
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,720
security teams

352
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,279
usually get advanced notice of

353
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,720
developments

354
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,600
we have part of our job is basically

355
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,279
having a good information position

356
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,880
on what is what is happening in the

357
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,560
cyber security world

358
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,800
and not all of our users in constituents

359
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,600
are

360
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,720
um have this

361
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,600
um and it's our duty to to keep them

362
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,800
informed about

363
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,560
their current threats and risks um

364
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,240
and of course we have to do this with

365
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
appropriate efforts

366
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,880
considering confidentiality privacy laws

367
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,560
regulations

368
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,959
and any other obligations that we have

369
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,000
towards

370
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,160
others countries or our

371
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,639
partners

372
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,519
um

373
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,560
yeah i think that that's uh

374
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,000
awesome yeah you just have to be um

375
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,199
um we have to keep them informed uh in a

376
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,639
way that they can understand also

377
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,320
that's a good point um respect for human

378
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,760
rights

379
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,120
as incident responders we have access

380
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,720
to a lot of information a lot of things

381
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,639
that can impact others

382
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,800
whether it's sharing information

383
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,120
possible bias in our actions

384
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,360
or even an infringement property rights

385
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
in some in some spaces

386
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
and we need to realize we've got access

387
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,040
to

388
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,440
personal sensitive confidential

389
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,560
information

390
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,160
we're handling all these different kinds

391
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,240
of instances um

392
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,519
you know we normally have some

393
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,519
guidelines into how we handle that

394
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,760
but keeping in mind that there's a human

395
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,680
being potentially on the other end of

396
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,760
this investigation is very important and

397
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,880
that we have to respect

398
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,360
those rights this was kind of a very

399
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,120
interesting one for us to discuss

400
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,240
because

401
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,160
i think there's some different regional

402
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,320
perspectives on this

403
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,600
i know for some of our members who are

404
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,000
over

405
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,880
in europe where there's a lot more

406
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,399
around human rights and

407
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,480
and governments stating as much versus

408
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,920
where i am in the states where it's not

409
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,880
blindness is heavily influenced

410
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,120
if you will it has to be some very

411
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,800
interesting discussions on what

412
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
what that means from a cyber security

413
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,839
perspective uh

414
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,920
we try to leave it fairly general

415
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,120
because again it's

416
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
going to vary kind of from organization

417
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,600
to organization place to place

418
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,240
but the main part we wanted to reiterate

419
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,959
is that

420
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,680
during an incident we shouldn't be uh

421
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,160
acting in a biased manner

422
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,199
and we should be trying to do the least

423
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,160
amount of harm

424
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,759
during an incident because you know

425
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,000
sometimes you have to go in and

426
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,759
as you were saying you're you're

427
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,600
investigating and tearing a few things

428
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,959
and trying to find what was happening

429
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,600
uh but just to be aware of where that

430
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,240
could uh

431
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,959
put cross lines and for the purposes of

432
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,240
this principle we

433
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,000
took the notion of property just to

434
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,639
clarify from the human declaration of

435
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,880
human rights article 17

436
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,279
uh just so that includes intangible

437
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,199
things like intellectual property

438
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,360
uh as well as other ideas and concepts

439
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,440
in general uh regardless of whether

440
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,120
they're legally protected or not so that

441
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,759
was a

442
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,000
that was an interesting route that we

443
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,920
talked about a lot before we came up

444
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,399
with this

445
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,079
conclusion

446
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,880
the next slide please team health this

447
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,199
is actually one of my personal favorites

448
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,000
because i've worked on some not so

449
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,839
healthy teams

450
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,240
can you say toxic maybe yes um

451
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,759
we want to make sure we're taking care

452
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,399
of our teams we have stressful jobs

453
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,120
um especially for an incident responder

454
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,920
it's like what

455
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,279
what day do you actually get to go in

456
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,720
the office and do the things that you

457
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,240
had written on your to-do list

458
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,120
not very often potentially so how do you

459
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,839
keep your team

460
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,399
physically and emotionally healthy you

461
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,800
know how do you keep them safe

462
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,240
and how do you make sure that you're

463
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,000
reducing their stress

464
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
um the physical and emotional health is

465
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,240
we have jobs we have to do we tell our

466
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,839
constituents that we

467
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,280
are going to handle incidents that we're

468
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,880
going to you know

469
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,919
release bulletins whatever your role is

470
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,359
but to be able to have people who are

471
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,359
functioning you need to make sure that

472
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,000
they're they're

473
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,039
relatively healthy um

474
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,839
we also want to make sure that normal

475
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,119
operations

476
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,599
aren't always emergencies and so that

477
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,880
people

478
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,520
can be supported during that time and so

479
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
you have that normal day

480
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,120
and you're able to rest up and able to

481
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,880
have that normal day so when the

482
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,120
incidents the bad ones do happen

483
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,720
they seem to be free more frequently in

484
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,320
the last few months

485
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,559
uh you're able to step up you're able to

486
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,360
actually

487
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,200
do all the things you need to do to take

488
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,799
care of the united states

489
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,799
it's a good investment because one if

490
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,919
you don't

491
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,840
people make mistakes from a tire or

492
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,120
under stress

493
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,280
and number two if you keep folks under

494
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,960
stress constantly

495
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,799
you have a high likelihood of having

496
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,280
turnover and there's all that wonderful

497
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,720
experience walking out the door um

498
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
i've been on teams where if you would

499
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160
survive a year and a half you would

500
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,840
consider going to the old grey dogs

501
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,559
um i don't know about you but nowadays

502
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,160
a year and a half turnover would drive

503
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,320
me insane and would be very unproductive

504
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,440
for the team

505
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,000
so to me this is this is the

506
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,960
trustworthiness

507
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,400
i think two of the most important ones

508
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,000
in my mind just to to

509
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,039
get the all the overall incident team in

510
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,160
a better position to do their roles

511
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,360
and could go to the next slide please

512
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,080
yeah so yeah one of the things we have

513
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,840
to realize is we can't be superheroes

514
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,880
all of the time

515
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,039
um and we have to we have to

516
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,760
cater to the team's abilities we also

517
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,840
have to be aware that subsecurity is

518
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,960
changing a lot

519
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,400
um and it's happening very rapidly

520
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,160
um and but we have a responsibility to

521
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,799
to our constituency to to our jobs and

522
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,360
and

523
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,720
uh to the community to to keep up uh

524
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,679
and to keep updated so you also have to

525
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,679
be aware that there's a duty to

526
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,640
uh to ability and to maintain that

527
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,919
ability so that

528
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,200
you provide opportunity for study um and

529
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,039
and you plan to everybody's strength and

530
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,320
diversity each

531
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,320
person brings a unique perspective

532
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,799
and you should be open to that and and

533
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,760
they should have time and resources to

534
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,960
be able to study

535
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,039
and um

536
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,960
get the grips with with the most

537
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,799
advanced technological and scientific

538
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,320
knowledge within their areas of

539
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,400
responsibility and there's

540
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,160
there's a lot happening and it's and

541
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,880
it's very valuable to keep up with that

542
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,520
um to be able to work with the new

543
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,039
insights

544
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,679
and it's just not just important it's

545
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,320
also very inspiring and it helps you

546
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,360
to keep your job interesting and it

547
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,480
helps prevent that turnover

548
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,360
um and if we go to the next one there's

549
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,640
a

550
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,159
responsible connection i mentioned

551
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,240
before that there's sometimes you have

552
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
to do forensics

553
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,120
um you're going in you're you're logging

554
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,280
traffic um

555
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,159
your logging emails your logging package

556
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,440
whatever

557
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,120
um i mentioned before you should be

558
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
aware of what your authorization is

559
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,600
how far you can go with with actually

560
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,520
capturing all of this

561
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
and of course when when you when you

562
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,880
start an investigation

563
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
you have no idea what is going on and

564
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,720
you're you're just trying to capture

565
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,679
everything um but once you start

566
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,120
figuring out

567
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,960
during your investigation what is going

568
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,400
on then you can narrow the scope

569
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,159
and you should narrow what you collect

570
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,760
you shouldn't be

571
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,039
casting the net out wide

572
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,200
all of the time you should be very

573
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,880
focused

574
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,559
on what it is that you're you're lacking

575
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,640
in order to support your investigation

576
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,679
and of course

577
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,640
um you may make uh it may be necessary

578
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,440
to make data available to other teams

579
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,000
um but be aware that it may be necessary

580
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,200
to redact some of that

581
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,440
information the personal information

582
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,880
that you don't release more than you

583
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,240
have to

584
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,919
um you should be outweighing the risk

585
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,360
against the benefits um we

586
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,640
we often have to work with law

587
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,720
enforcement and

588
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,440
they have a different uh stake in these

589
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,360
kind of investigations than you do

590
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,480
um and and sometimes those align and

591
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,240
sometimes those

592
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,200
go against each other um and that's not

593
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,960
necessarily a bad thing you just

594
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,480
need to be aware of them and you need to

595
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,400
be aware of what uh what that

596
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,120
might impact um how that might impact

597
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,280
others that you were

598
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,880
that you're working with um

599
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,640
and one of the things that is very often

600
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,200
forgotten is

601
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,840
destroying data in accordance with data

602
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,039
retention policies

603
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,679
and of course i'm in in the eu and

604
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,400
there's lots

605
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,760
lots of discussions on the gdpr um

606
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,080
one of the things that that's very often

607
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
forgotten still even in the eu

608
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,280
is is safely destroying data and

609
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,200
and having data retention policies

610
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,679
and policies and measures in place that

611
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,120
you actually

612
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,679
provably destroy data

613
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,280
one of the things that's happening now

614
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,360
is i see that we're in a zoom call that

615
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,400
has only 10 minutes left

616
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,159
and i think our session is longer

617
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,879
but yeah we'll see how that goes um

618
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,320
up next is the jurisdictional boundaries

619
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,360
for you john thank you

620
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,320
so obviously when we're doing incidents

621
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,480
especially when they are intense that

622
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,559
uh stand outside of our our local area

623
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,799
we're going to have to be very cognizant

624
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,960
of

625
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,240
this can be you know country to country

626
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,559
this can be organization organization

627
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,600
region to region state uh

628
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,559
county whatever the breakdown is where

629
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,440
you are

630
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,400
um the fun part is sometimes as those

631
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,200
laws are not

632
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,400
always uh congruous and we can

633
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,360
kind of go against each other and so

634
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,000
it's

635
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,400
always good to try and try and figure

636
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,919
out kind of what those boundaries need

637
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,159
to be beforehand if you can

638
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,360
uh working with the uh working with your

639
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,240
lawyers

640
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,799
uh to identify where there may be risks

641
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,480
is very important

642
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,559
uh keeping in mind because when you're

643
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,840
in the middle of an incident trying to

644
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,480
go and get

645
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,960
the legal questions answered can be

646
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,720
difficult and time consuming you might

647
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,960
not have a lot of time on your hands

648
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,640
as you're fighting this um

649
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,960
laws and regulations and other legal

650
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,679
issues

651
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,559
like those related privacy protection

652
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,240
data bridge notifications

653
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
and they're going to potentially differ

654
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,360
from place to place

655
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,799
um i know i get pulled into

656
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,039
discussions with vendors all the time

657
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,000
about what

658
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,559
are the uh what are the incident

659
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,840
response requirements

660
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,320
uh for for notification and breaches and

661
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
it can vary from region to region

662
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,520
and trying to get one set

663
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,799
across all of our our active vendors is

664
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,159
very difficult

665
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,120
um we've got issues between uh different

666
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,960
political regions different

667
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,600
even here in our in the states where we

668
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,720
have some students that are

669
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,760
much more um litigious than others and

670
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,600
have a lot more rules and regulations

671
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,320
than others

672
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,480
and so being aware of those is very

673
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,559
important especially when you're

674
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,640
dealing information and collaborating or

675
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,480
handing off information

676
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,919
or sharing vulnerability information

677
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,159
just want to be aware of the key issues

678
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,880
that are affecting each jurisdiction

679
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,799
including but not limited to obviously

680
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,640
privacy and data breach

681
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,840
um cyber security and privacy laws and

682
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,760
regulations evolve and continued to

683
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,400
change

684
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,640
uh and i've been seeing things change

685
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,080
over the last couple of years

686
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,559
uh very quickly and so it's very

687
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,159
important to stand on top of those

688
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,480
and be aware especially if it's areas

689
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,360
that you are

690
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,880
doing a lot of interactions with uh so

691
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,039
you know i with my company where we

692
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,000
currently are there's

693
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,760
a lot of things we do obviously with

694
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,840
folks in the asia pacific region

695
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,679
so being kind of aware and cognizant of

696
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,640
that has been very important for us

697
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,760
and we'll go on to the next slide please

698
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,279
evidence-based reasoning um

699
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,400
this is pretty basic we

700
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,520
use the facts um provide

701
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,200
evidence and and scope that's

702
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,559
transparent

703
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,200
uh if it's not possible for some reason

704
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,240
in that

705
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,600
corporate legal government whatever it

706
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,400
is

707
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,840
uh try uh try to at least let folks know

708
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,919
why you can't share the information uh

709
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:10,880
you know saying hey

710
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,840
it's under embargo or you know we're

711
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,080
legally obliged to do something else

712
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,520
sharing what you can being as

713
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,120
transparent as you can

714
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,880
and the understanding of their limits

715
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,159
depending on what

716
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,919
organization you're coming from um

717
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,919
trying to refrain from starving rumors

718
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,760
um it's always good

719
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,080
that um thank you thank you

720
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,000
that we share our thoughts on things we

721
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
all come with different experiences and

722
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,360
sharing kinds of things we've seen the

723
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,039
past are great but when you're in the

724
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,640
middle of the incident you want to deal

725
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,960
with the facts and not

726
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,880
not something that that is going to

727
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,279
prove to be false and lead you down a

728
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,840
rabbit hole you don't need to be going

729
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,200
down

730
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,360
and transparent evidence and reasoning

731
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,120
processes are also important even in

732
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,679
cases of automated sharing

733
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,520
during the automation process showing

734
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,039
large amounts of data

735
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,159
you want to make sure there's a

736
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,960
description of the data mining process

737
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,200
and make sure that's communicated at an

738
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,880
intelligent level of detail so

739
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,400
if somebody's looking at from the other

740
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,840
end they can understand what it is

741
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,559
they're getting

742
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,399
where it's coming from and with that so

743
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,919
we've talked about all these things

744
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:20,880
we've talked about

745
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,559
how things can be in congruent and kind

746
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,799
of fight each other and so now

747
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,000
it's going to walk us through a little

748
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,760
bit only dealing with dilemmas

749
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,879
yeah um

750
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,320
and i mentioned before uh we have all of

751
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,799
these

752
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,000
duties uh we have a dozen of these um

753
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,679
and they may conflict with each other

754
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,200
and you're you're ending up with

755
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,960
dilemmas

756
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,320
and uh so you end up in a in a situation

757
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,120
where it's hard

758
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,240
to to see your way out of it um

759
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,080
and i used ernie here with this rubber

760
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,279
ducky um

761
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,600
and this is a principle that's that's

762
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,320
also

763
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,600
um that works with debugging is rubber

764
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,360
ducky debugging

765
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,520
and the same thing is with dilemmas you

766
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,799
you you talk

767
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,840
you talk to somebody polly preferably

768
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,279
somebody who's aware of these

769
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,399
these duties and by

770
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,679
talking out having the discussion um you

771
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,679
you very often you see what is what is

772
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,279
going on what what the

773
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,399
um what the different values are how

774
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,640
they affect stakeholders etc

775
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,440
and then with that you can you can work

776
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,799
your way out of the dilemma

777
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,000
and and it may not always be

778
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,200
to your liking um

779
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,279
and if necessary you could you could

780
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,039
make a recommendation that's different

781
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,120
than what you're doing

782
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,320
you note that that that's um that that's

783
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,039
how you

784
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,640
uh see this situation um

785
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,679
and then yeah and we have to go on

786
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,360
um because very very often our work is

787
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,200
time sensitive

788
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,520
but still take some time to to deal with

789
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,480
these dilemmas

790
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,600
and and reflect on

791
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,840
what it is that you're doing and that's

792
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,760
i believe that that's very valuable

793
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,559
in maintaining that high level of trust

794
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,520
that we have

795
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,440
um to both within our community but also

796
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,720
uh from society to us uh one of the

797
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,799
other recommendations that we have soon

798
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,799
i know discussing this is when you have

799
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,080
a dilemma

800
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,440
is potentially depending on again get

801
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,720
talked to your legal advice

802
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,799
documenting their kind of your your

803
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,039
options and why you took the route

804
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,720
[Music]

805
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,279
yeah and there's something with with uh

806
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,159
brainstorming

807
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,440
uh that helps a lot this is um either

808
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,840
to um change the way that you're you're

809
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,720
documenting it

810
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,000
and so either speaking or writing down

811
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,640
it often helps you gain different

812
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
perspectives

813
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,080
but still noting down what your options

814
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,440
are and why you chose what you do

815
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,200
it helps um

816
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,760
and uh so we have a couple of case

817
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,640
studies that we

818
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,960
that we can go through one of them is uh

819
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
is it a personal one um that i

820
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,200
experienced we had a researcher reach

821
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,520
out to us

822
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,200
and they found vulnerabilities in ssds

823
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,000
so secures

824
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,039
so the hard drives portable hard drives

825
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:33,679
and there's

826
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,399
encryption in there he took a closer

827
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,360
look at the

828
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,480
the encryptions of those hard drives and

829
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,919
the implementation was lacking

830
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,600
and it turned out to be a industry-wide

831
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,279
problem um and then we started reaching

832
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:51,760
out

833
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,240
so first of all of course we have to we

834
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,600
have the duty of vulnerability

835
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,120
disclosure so

836
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,080
we took this up um this was an academic

837
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,000
researcher it's very hard for them

838
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,840
to to reach out to all of the different

839
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,760
vendors to to even figure out who the

840
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,480
vendors are

841
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,399
and the contact information um

842
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,120
so we took it upon us to coordinate this

843
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,519
issue

844
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,279
we reached out to vendors and then we

845
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,559
started to realize that

846
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,320
was actually um

847
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,519
the vendors were not allowed to talk to

848
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,039
each other

849
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,320
due to market protections and this

850
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,080
created a very difficult situation for

851
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,320
us

852
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,720
because we needed to talk to them and we

853
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,559
needed to relay information

854
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,720
between them um but then without

855
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,679
identifying explicitly identifying the

856
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,880
other vendors that were affected

857
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,360
and that uh yeah that created a very

858
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,799
interesting situation where we had

859
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,080
multiple conversations

860
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,840
uh and at some point of course they

861
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,120
realized who the

862
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,640
other vendors were um but still we

863
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,000
couldn't explicitly state

864
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,799
that uh and and we had to coordinate all

865
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,200
this with different conversations

866
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,360
uh be transparent to each of them

867
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,600
um there were some legal negotiations

868
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,240
which also was very difficult because

869
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,640
the

870
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,120
the very different jurisdictions because

871
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,879
it was a dutch academic researcher

872
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,559
vendors in in korea and other countries

873
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,240
and so this was just

874
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,919
this took a long time um and there were

875
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,320
very many different dilemmas that kept

876
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,200
going up

877
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,320
uh and it took some

878
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,159
serious discussions with colleagues and

879
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,360
and how to uh

880
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,919
uh keep going with this and doing this

881
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,000
in the right way

882
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,960
in the end we did

883
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,919
we did uh end up with with vulnerability

884
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:54,559
disclosure

885
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,519
open it was coordinated and and i

886
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,039
believe things have been fixed

887
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,679
so that's a win at least

888
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,200
and then the next one um we didn't

889
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,159
identify this

890
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,200
within our um case studies

891
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
we're currently working on a set of case

892
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,440
studies uh but while

893
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,159
discussing this and seeing developments

894
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,080
over the last few months

895
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,120
we i i just felt we couldn't uh ignore

896
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,159
this one

897
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,000
um and of course this this picture is

898
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,640
from the

899
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,600
wannacry ransomware um that i had the

900
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,200
pleasure of dealing with in

901
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,480
the netherlands um but

902
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,399
other than i mean we're seeing a lot of

903
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,519
different threats

904
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,399
of ransomware to many different uh

905
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,320
organizations

906
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,880
and it's just rise with dilemmas that

907
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,360
that

908
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,360
uh keep coming coming up because there

909
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,960
are so many different actors

910
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
involved there's different jurisdictions

911
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,880
there's different

912
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,240
impacts of user data confidential data

913
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,519
that may be leaked out or not um impacts

914
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,720
to privacy laws

915
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,480
impact to um

916
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,480
intellectual property um

917
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,918
and you want to go after the people who

918
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,359
the perpetrators but of course that's

919
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,280
not what incident responders do

920
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,839
uh so you have to work with law

921
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,639
enforcement

922
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,560
uh but then you have to be aware of what

923
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,359
what it is that you can and cannot

924
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,399
exchange with law enforcement

925
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,599
um in the case of wannacry there was a

926
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,800
nation-state actor

927
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,918
uh behind this you may have to work with

928
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,960
with uh intelligence agencies

929
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,000
um that opens up another kind of worms

930
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,040
that that

931
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,079
kind of dilemmas that come up

932
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,359
so i can imagine that this is just

933
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,399
uh um

934
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
these kind of things will come up in the

935
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,880
dating operations

936
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,280
of many teams and uh yeah it's just

937
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,839
i didn't we just want to say that we

938
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,680
explicitly identified that this is hard

939
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,520
and that there's no solution easy

940
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,000
solution i think the other point to

941
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,599
mention here too as well as you know

942
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,640
we're sitting here and giving you

943
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
external examples which is a lot of what

944
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,880
the case studies that we're working on

945
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
are around but some of these are going

946
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,680
to be internal to your own organizations

947
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,800
um i had an incident where a researcher

948
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,079
reached out to me and said

949
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,800
hey i found all of this open data out on

950
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,240
the internet

951
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,520
i said wait stop telling me no more

952
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,880
he had broken the terms of service now

953
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,599
at my older company i knew we would be

954
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,000
fine

955
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,400
since the information we worked through

956
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,839
yesterday that's fine

957
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,320
but this new company i wasn't sure they

958
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,119
were a little

959
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,720
a little newer a little bit different

960
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,119
culture and so i had to stop

961
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,800
before i was given anything that could

962
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,160
be potentially

963
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,800
damaging and go to the lawyers and kind

964
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,359
of educate them on what cbd was

965
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,560
uh educate them on kind of certain

966
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,599
expectations

967
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,119
and so you know make sure they were

968
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,440
comfortable with how this was going to

969
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,480
uh to go and once i had that legal

970
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,680
buy-in that no

971
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,520
we would not as a company go after this

972
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
person or do anything

973
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,599
of that nature i could then go back to

974
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,760
them and say we're good to go please

975
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,680
allow me to have that information but i

976
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,040
wanted to be transparent with that

977
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,880
researcher to let them know hey

978
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,800
hold off and then work on the

979
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,640
jurisdiction side the legal side of

980
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,599
things to make sure

981
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,680
that it was an internal thing that i had

982
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,640
so

983
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,359
all sorts of cases that's that's what we

984
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,200
meant with the duty of confidentiality

985
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
and being transparent about what what it

986
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,400
is that you can keep

987
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,680
uh confidential what you can't

988
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,599
and awesome yeah

989
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,200
cool all right last almost last slide

990
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,640
please

991
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,920
yeah so what's what's next so we've been

992
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,680
working on this for about two years we

993
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,760
have these lovely set of duties

994
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,560
which are now translated into arabic

995
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,359
chinese

996
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,880
french russian and spanish

997
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,720
we're now looking for organizations and

998
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,040
companies to endorse the code

999
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,000
not saying that you're going to say

1000
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,599
we're going to follow it step by step

1001
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,800
but that you think this is a good idea

1002
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,040
we're looking for help into completing

1003
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,320
our cases

1004
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,839
uh for the duties so again it's not the

1005
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,680
same 12 of us have been looking at this

1006
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,440
a while and we could certainly use

1007
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,680
some fresh perspectives some fresh

1008
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,200
experiences

1009
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,760
uh the nice thing to know is you do not

1010
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,280
need to be a member of first

1011
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,599
to come and join our state our special

1012
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,640
interest group

1013
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,079
uh you can come and we have uh meetings

1014
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:46,960
that are

1015
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,480
both regional uh somewhat regional

1016
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,119
friendly

1017
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,480
um from this united states perspective

1018
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,400
and an early morning on a late afternoon

1019
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,720
so we're trying to get to get somewhat

1020
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,640
friendly for all the regions

1021
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,839
um we're also looking to create training

1022
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:04,880
and content

1023
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,200
the big thing at first is we want to

1024
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,560
help bring security

1025
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,960
up for everyone so that's creating

1026
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,000
standards that's

1027
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,720
creating education and training and

1028
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,680
documents

1029
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,000
that will that are usually free of use

1030
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,640
for anyone whether you remember or not

1031
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,560
and so we want to create some training

1032
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,839
around these codes

1033
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,839
to help people when they're creating

1034
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,200
their own or

1035
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,240
taking ours and munching it a little bit

1036
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,200
the things they want to think about um

1037
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,800
one little bit of thing about us

1038
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,119
is that this started off as a project to

1039
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,560
create a code of ethics for

1040
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,880
first itself that was kind of our scope

1041
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,160
when we started

1042
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,920
but as we took it to the board and they

1043
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,280
looked at it wow this

1044
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,880
this was a lot of work this was a great

1045
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,040
idea and they saw a benefit

1046
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,480
into sharing this more broadly for other

1047
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,320
teams to look at and potentially create

1048
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,000
their own so

1049
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,760
very excited with the amount of work we

1050
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,839
still have left to do

1051
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,400
i should note also that we um uh we

1052
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,839
worked with lawyers

1053
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,800
to look at the text and has been phrased

1054
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,040
in such a way that it doesn't

1055
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,079
it doesn't present requirements it's not

1056
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,960
um uh how'd you say this

1057
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,520
it's voluntary and and it's just

1058
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,000
suggestions on how to deal with dilemmas

1059
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,440
in incidents etc

1060
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,240
um it doesn't require you to do anything

1061
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,839
so if so if you're interested our emails

1062
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:36,400
are here

1063
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,720
sean at first and and you're inventing

1064
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,119
ncsc.now

1065
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,079
we would love to hear from you um and

1066
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:44,400
with

1067
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,240
that i believe we're down on our last

1068
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,920
slide and to see if anyone

1069
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,520
has any questions yeah cool have a round

1070
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,839
of applause real quickly

1071
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,440
so uh there were a few questions or a

1072
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,119
couple questions but we are

1073
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,640
very quickly running out of time so we

1074
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,720
need to swap over laptops so

1075
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,880
if we get mark and alex to come up the

1076
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,319
stage maybe we can do it simultaneously

1077
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,520
so we can answer the questions is that

1078
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:13,920
all right

1079
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,359
[Music]

1080
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,560
fantastic so the first question

1081
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,000
um is to join um

1082
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,200
you are doing some impressive work and

1083
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,839
important work in your experience does

1084
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,839
the dutch government apply principles

1085
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,319
set by the ncsc well enough

1086
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,520
or does mark root rut

1087
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,800
not take this seriously

1088
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,920
so margaret is our is our

1089
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,160
prime minister he um

1090
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,960
there are different ministers there are

1091
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,000
different

1092
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,440
stakes involved in government um my

1093
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,599
my so i work for the minister of uh

1094
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,200
justice and security

1095
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,400
um and as the name implies he has

1096
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,359
different

1097
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,720
uh uh constituencies so the dutch police

1098
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,760
is also

1099
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,920
reporting to that minister the law

1100
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,040
enforcement the

1101
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,160
uh et cetera so

1102
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,200
there are different stakes involved we

1103
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,520
do

1104
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,440
support the the encryption

1105
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,440
and we're very vocal about that and

1106
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,480
different parts of

1107
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,599
our government support the idea of

1108
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,200
encryption um and and we try to

1109
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,640
uh be very open about that yeah

1110
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,359
and i i do my best to be an advocate for

1111
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,560
that

1112
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,520
thanks fantastic thank you and we do

1113
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,240
have

1114
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,319
maybe time for one more question really

1115
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,680
quickly so

1116
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,160
uh we often talk about designing our

1117
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,000
processes with ethical principles in

1118
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,280
mind

1119
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,760
what should we do when we find our

1120
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,200
current processes were

1121
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,920
very unethical already how should we

1122
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,800
respond to that

1123
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,480
well that's that's a good question i

1124
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
think uh the first thing to do is kind

1125
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,040
of do

1126
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,359
a gap analysis of where you're seeing

1127
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,240
things fall

1128
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,880
down um you know where are the areas

1129
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,280
that need to be addressed and then

1130
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,920
you know work together to find what the

1131
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,400
right

1132
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,839
direction is to to shore those up um

1133
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,359
it's all you can always change your

1134
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,880
process and policies

1135
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,280
to better align it's always better to

1136
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,960
say yeah we used to do it like this in

1137
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,040
the past but we've learned better and

1138
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,480
now we're doing it like this

1139
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,599
in the future um certainly uh

1140
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,720
you know talk with uh talk with your

1141
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,800
constituents internally and get their

1142
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,240
input as well

1143
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,200
do you have any other funds yeah so this

1144
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,000
is this has been

1145
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,800
one of the goals also to uh of ethics

1146
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,280
first

1147
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,960
to to change that um and create a public

1148
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,280
resource for others to

1149
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,040
be able to point at explicitly and

1150
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,800
saying this is how we do things and

1151
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,040
answer response and security

1152
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,079
and now we have this on on ethics first

1153
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,119
it's supported by first.org and many

1154
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,520
other organizations and you can use that

1155
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,960
to advocate for

1156
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,720
for a different approach

1157
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,280
cool thank you so much for that um and

1158
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,960
kind of a massive round of applause

1159
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,800
because we've got jern who's coming from

1160
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,680
netherlands

1161
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,359
probably got up at five in the morning

1162
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,119
this morning yes we got

1163
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,960
sean on the other side of the world

1164
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,720
which is quite late over there as well

1165
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,960
so time zones are very difficult in

1166
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,079
covered world

1167
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,960
