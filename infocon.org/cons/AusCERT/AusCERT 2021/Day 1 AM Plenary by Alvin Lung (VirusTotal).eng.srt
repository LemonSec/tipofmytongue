1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,000
to wrap it up and get us to our morning

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
tea break a customer engineer at google

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,359
cloud who specializes in threat

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,080
detection

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,680
15 years of experience in the managed

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,200
security service and the

7
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,759
cm space to help customers improve their

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,120
detection capabilities and identify

9
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,599
threats

10
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,440
unknown to their environment he's

11
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,720
presented by one of our

12
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,279
sponsors virus total thank you so much

13
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,080
virus tuttle

14
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,880
from google cloud talking about threat

15
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,920
intelligence

16
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,039
without context is just noise this is

17
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,840
alvin long give him a round of applause

18
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
albert

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,800
can everyone hear me okay yeah

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,480
well thank you for joining me with this

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,399
talk about threat intelligence without

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,239
context is just noise and

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,920
as i already introduced my name is alvin

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,360
long and i'm a customer engineer at

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,840
virustotal

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,719
now just about every organization today

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,160
adopts some sort of threat intelligence

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,800
strategy

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,160
as part of their overall security

30
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,239
strategy and what i'm going to talk

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,280
about today

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,360
are some of the ways to deploy a better

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,960
threat intelligence strategy

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,880
and how to build that solidly into your

35
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,640
organization

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,439
to provide the desired results and i

37
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,560
also cover some of the

38
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,200
common mistakes that we see and the best

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,240
possible ways to avoid them

40
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,000
now just a couple of words around threat

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,600
intelligence itself

42
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,400
it's a heavily used word and widely

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,479
adopted in marketing materials

44
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,520
and as we all know threat intelligence

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,439
has been around for centuries it's

46
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,520
simply just information about threats

47
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
and threat actors that are related or

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,520
relevant to you or that's associated

49
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,479
with you

50
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,560
and how do you take that information to

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,960
potentially mitigate harmful events

52
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,479
and all we're trying to do now is apply

53
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,200
that into cyberspace

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,720
so keeping that in mind what are your

55
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,560
goals and what is it that you're trying

56
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,479
to achieve

57
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,040
because the discipline on its own

58
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,880
virtually does nothing

59
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,040
it's how you adopt that information and

60
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,320
then apply that to your goals

61
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,639
now

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,959
sorry it's a bit of a mind-blowing yeah

63
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,200
um

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,879
and it might come as no surprise to you

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,959
it may be controversial to some of you

66
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,440
that you can't buy threat intelligence

67
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,640
threat intelligence

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,840
is a result of suggestions based on the

69
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,200
data

70
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,879
and then you make a set of decisions or

71
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,239
a specific decision

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,239
depending on your goals as well as the

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,440
knowledge you have at that specific

74
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,959
point in time

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,800
so we should be very specific about the

76
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,319
data we want to incorporate

77
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,239
and making sure that it's relevant to us

78
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,760
otherwise it ends up just being noise

79
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,480
now how successful our investigations

80
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,200
are depends on our methodology

81
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,480
and this very much applies to threat

82
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,280
intelligence as well

83
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,400
now

84
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,680
sorry there's something missing here

85
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,120
now i'll cover off some of the most

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,280
common use cases

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,640
that are commonly used with fair

88
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,400
intelligence now the first one being

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,720
alert prioritization

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,959
so it's no surprise to anyone

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,560
one of us here that security teams or

92
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,400
security analysts are inundated with

93
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,799
alerts and they're spending a lot of

94
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,440
time

95
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,799
trying to understand what is relevant

96
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,720
for them now

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,920
trying to understand what is relevant

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,200
and not what is not relevant isn't

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,080
always that simple

100
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,159
it basic is it's based on the data that

101
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,159
they have as well as the understanding

102
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,519
of the situation at that particular

103
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,120
point in time

104
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,560
the next most common use case we see is

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,239
around incident response and forensic

106
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,519
analysis

107
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,120
and usually with those particular use

108
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,959
cases you're starting off with a very

109
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,760
partial vision of something

110
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,599
but as quickly as possible you want to

111
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,360
identify everything associated with that

112
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,000
incident

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,840
so usually the who what where and the

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,239
what and the why

115
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,239
and then we also have tactics techniques

116
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,560
and procedures or ttps

117
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
these help characterize and understand

118
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,319
what an attacker is leveraging

119
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,720
and also how equipped your organization

120
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,798
is to deal with them

121
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,399
but each of these use cases requires

122
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,800
context and in in all of these cases

123
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,919
context is king

124
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,320
and when we do have the right context we

125
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,960
can

126
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,720
greatly improve our chances of making

127
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,840
these use cases successful

128
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,560
so already talked about this around and

129
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,080
i'm sure everyone knows security alerts

130
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,880
to take

131
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,479
thousands of alerts that analysts and

132
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,479
teams have to deal with every single day

133
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,560
and how do we try and use that with or

134
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,919
combine that with threat intelligence to

135
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,560
reduce that noise

136
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,759
now one of the first things we see and

137
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,440
one of the most common mistakes we see

138
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,680
is around simple characterization

139
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,720
and what i mean by simple

140
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,280
characterization is taking a single data

141
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,040
point or a single reference

142
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,479
and then making a determination from

143
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,960
that now

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
the most commonly seen that's been used

145
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,880
and that's with virustotal is

146
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,360
how many av engines have identified a

147
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,199
file as malicious

148
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,039
now i'm sure a lot of you have used that

149
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,560
and i definitely myself have

150
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,400
i've gone and checked a particular file

151
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,919
based on the number that's come back

152
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,919
then i'll make a determination and make

153
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,759
my next kind of move

154
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,840
or action now

155
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,560
just like in the graph here that

156
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,039
detection rate can change

157
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,960
and as we know with the start of a lot a

158
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,880
lot of the startup campaigns

159
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,280
there are no detections across the board

160
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,240
and as

161
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,960
time goes on the av industry catches up

162
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,880
and then detection starts coming in

163
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,360
so the vice versa can also happen right

164
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
you might have false positives starting

165
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
from day one

166
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,758
and these are the gmat programs

167
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,320
i'm not saying that using av engines as

168
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,600
a detection rate is bad

169
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
it's a great start but we should look to

170
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,120
add other characteristics

171
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,360
in our checks and i'll give you a very

172
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
very simple example

173
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
you may want to take in the or factor in

174
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,479
things like when the file was submitted

175
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,840
or when was the file

176
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,479
created and if these are relatively

177
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,360
recent

178
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,720
as well as the detection rates are

179
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,880
relatively low you may want to come back

180
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,080
again and check that file

181
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,160
sometime in the future now everything i

182
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,759
just said that is all relative

183
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,360
because it depends on your organization

184
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,800
depends on your risk factor

185
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,240
as well as depending on your resources

186
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,000
now give let me give you a real world

187
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,840
example

188
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,199
i'm sure everyone here has heard of the

189
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,120
tool mimicaps possibly the greatest

190
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,600
password ceiling tool ever invented

191
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,520
now for a long period of time the

192
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,800
detection of mimikatz

193
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,840
was purely on its hash there's many

194
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,600
use cases and many videos online about

195
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,520
this where someone would simply change

196
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,000
the name

197
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
mimikatz to say mimi dogs and upload it

198
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,560
to for scanning

199
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,919
and there will be zero detections across

200
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,319
the board and i give it a day or two

201
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,680
then detection starts firing all over

202
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,599
the place so keep in mind

203
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,960
you know if you're just using a single

204
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,080
criteria understand the risk or the

205
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,160
other chances of things that go and fly

206
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,199
past under the radar

207
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,639
there are other things that we can try

208
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,720
and take in and incorporate there's many

209
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,160
open source intelligence sources that we

210
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,039
can take in

211
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,039
that references artifacts in other

212
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,039
similar style attacks

213
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,880
we can take in things like yara rules or

214
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,560
sigma rules ideas

215
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,680
rules maybe even sandbox reports to add

216
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,599
additional criteria in whatever we're

217
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,919
checking

218
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,520
now again i'm not saying that every

219
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,280
single rule is going to be useful but we

220
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,199
should take into account what we need

221
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,960
so that way we can have a multi-angular

222
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,240
approach

223
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
with added criteria rather than just a

224
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,759
single characterization like

225
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,160
the number of av engines picking up a

226
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,919
file or saying whether it's malicious or

227
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,080
not

228
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
the next thing i want to talk around is

229
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
on local context or rather the

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,080
lack of local contacts that we all have

231
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,840
i can safely assume that everyone here

232
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,879
in this room

233
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,400
does not have complete visibility of

234
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,160
their own internal network

235
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,919
because chances are you're either not

236
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,759
logging everything or absolutely

237
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,720
everything

238
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,879
or your security teams doesn't have full

239
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,240
context and understanding of how

240
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,720
everything interoperates with each other

241
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,639
and so if we only have partial visual

242
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,479
vision even in their own network

243
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,800
pretty much at all times we want to try

244
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,240
and supplement that with other sources

245
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,599
of information

246
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,960
things like maybe people or

247
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,800
organizations that have suffered the

248
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,520
same attack or similar types of attack

249
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,440
because we know attackers are recycling

250
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
the same tools or the same attacks

251
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,879
over and over again to breach multiple

252
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,039
organizations

253
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,360
we see this even with apt attacks again

254
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,200
they might be leveraging the same tools

255
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
or they've built a whole infrastructure

256
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,640
to support a range of tools that they

257
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,440
have

258
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,799
and then they go and compromise multiple

259
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,559
organizations with it

260
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,720
and so if we can leverage that past

261
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,920
information

262
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,160
we can get a lot more details about the

263
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,839
attack and that quickly

264
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,120
accelerates our investigation

265
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,519
capabilities we can also see how

266
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,279
attacks evolve over time as well

267
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
now another thing i want to talk about

268
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,600
is obviously monitoring whatever it is

269
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,279
that is important to us

270
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,000
but also apply live enrichment on top of

271
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,519
that data

272
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,360
now i mentioned before yara rules and

273
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,120
sigma rules

274
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
these are great way to help track and

275
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
characterize a particular malware or

276
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,000
malware family

277
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,760
say for example you may be interested in

278
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,480
ransomware or a particular attacker

279
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,760
that is targeting your organization

280
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,600
this is a great way to proactively

281
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
monitor any activity from these

282
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,399
attackers

283
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,600
or whatever it is that you might be

284
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,160
worried about

285
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,120
so this is important just like how we

286
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,680
want to

287
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,920
be selective in the sources of data we

288
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,680
want to incorporate

289
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,839
we can see how the adversaries or

290
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,399
attacks evolve over time

291
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,560
so you could be using crowdsource rules

292
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,920
and there's a number of open source

293
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,200
repositories out there

294
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,040
from famous researchers that talk about

295
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,880
you know or track particular attackers

296
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,640
or particular groups of malware family

297
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,800
and you can incorporate those or you can

298
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,000
craft your own rules

299
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,279
based on the attacks that you've seen

300
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,200
inside your organization as well as

301
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,959
doing your own searches

302
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,560
and these are extremely powerful and

303
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,399
helps you characterize what is important

304
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,680
to your organizations

305
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,440
as well as enable your organization to

306
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,040
start actively tracking and monitoring

307
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,760
these attackers

308
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,279
the next step i want to talk about is

309
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,279
around instant response and as i

310
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,120
mentioned before

311
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,560
um incident response is something that

312
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,640
we want to understand how complex and

313
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,240
how dangerous an attack is

314
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,839
with as little time as possible now

315
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,240
when when ir's involved as we probably

316
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,120
all know things tend to be very hot

317
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
for example you might want to as quickly

318
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,959
as possible gather all the information

319
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:39,760
around this

320
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,480
suspect incident that you have without

321
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,839
alerting the attacker that they've been

322
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,959
discovered

323
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,079
or um the attack is still very much

324
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:48,959
ongoing

325
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,160
and you're trying to understand and

326
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,000
assess what's the best way to respond to

327
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,640
this situation

328
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,079
now nurse comes in no surprise we're

329
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,000
going to talk about context again and

330
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,839
this is around using data blindly

331
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,760
without context

332
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,240
so on the list up here i've got a list

333
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,279
of iss

334
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,800
taken from a popular threat intelligence

335
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,079
exchange now ises are the minimum amount

336
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,399
of information that can be shared

337
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,240
regarding some kind of attack so

338
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,160
typically what we commonly see are the

339
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,720
hashes ips domains urls and so forth

340
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,079
now this is extremely valuable

341
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,880
information but a lot of times iscs

342
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,079
or with the information that doesn't

343
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,160
come with ics are like where did it

344
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,640
happen

345
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,560
how did it happen who was associated

346
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,320
attack and so on

347
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,720
now this domain that's highlighted up

348
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,920
here hopefully you can see that

349
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
this is called gardencityclub.com now

350
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,240
this is associated with

351
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,720
the attack group ocean lotus and for

352
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,839
those that prefer numbers

353
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,959
this is abt32 now

354
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,240
if you have that information you're

355
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,839
going to say if someone goes to that

356
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,639
domain

357
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,320
that's probably a good hit right we know

358
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
that it's malicious what's known to be

359
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,279
malicious it's associated with apt

360
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,320
activity

361
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,920
but if we dig a little bit deeper a

362
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,519
little bit more deeper into

363
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,920
what's actually involved this domain is

364
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
a legitimate website

365
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,720
it's about a golf club in cambodia and

366
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,959
abt32 compromised this website

367
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,880
and then they injected some code into

368
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,959
that website and what that code does is

369
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,560
checks for incoming connections

370
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,399
and where it's coming from and if you're

371
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,639
coming from vietnam or cambodia

372
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,880
then it will send a secondary or inject

373
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,160
something into that connection

374
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,480
to compromise that user so which means

375
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,160
if you're coming in from anywhere else

376
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,519
other than vietnam and cambodia

377
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,440
absolutely nothing will happen

378
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,880
and so you may have inadvertently wiped

379
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,920
someone's machine while they're

380
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,120
researching for the next holiday

381
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,040
now

382
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,200
another thing we want to take note is a

383
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,279
lot of times iocs

384
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,440
are not going to be malicious forever

385
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,959
and so the time

386
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,360
or the value of it is relative and it

387
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,200
also depends again on our use cases

388
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,880
because if we load this rc for live

389
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,959
monitoring versus this ioc

390
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,959
for instant response and there's a time

391
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,399
period associated with when it was

392
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,279
malicious

393
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,920
that use is very very different and so

394
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,720
we need to properly cleanse that data

395
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,480
before we use it and make sure we apply

396
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
all the context as much as possible

397
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,519
possible context as possible

398
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,360
otherwise its use again is relative

399
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
now i mentioned before that a lot of

400
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
attacks are recycled and reused

401
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,839
but in some cases the iss may be unique

402
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,040
per victim

403
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,800
if the attacker has enough resources

404
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,399
they can go and change the ic for every

405
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,399
single attack that they launch

406
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,720
now there's a way to go and combat this

407
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,959
and that is using similarity searches

408
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,320
this is an extremely powerful technique

409
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,399
so for example you may start off with a

410
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,160
hash of a file that you suspect is

411
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,600
associated with an attacker or

412
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,959
this is what's causing that suspicious

413
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,279
behavior using a similarity search you

414
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,040
can quickly pull up all files

415
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,480
that are similar to the file that you're

416
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,880
researching and that can help identify

417
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,720
the potential malware family it belongs

418
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,440
to

419
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,320
or whether files that are similar in the

420
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,880
past

421
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,320
have been used by the attackers before

422
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,920
now there are a number of different

423
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,440
similarity searches and i'll go through

424
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,399
a couple of them

425
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,519
the first one being structural

426
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,160
similarity and as the name implies

427
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,199
you're looking at the structural

428
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,360
behavior of the structure of the file

429
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,800
and you're looking for the similarities

430
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
inside them and so typically you're

431
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,839
looking at the strings and patterns

432
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:14,720
inside them

433
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,880
which is commonly derived with the use

434
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,720
of yarra rules

435
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,240
then next one we've got is around

436
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,720
behavior and our analysis

437
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,360
and that is when the file is executed we

438
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,399
see what sort of

439
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,399
you know interactions that file does

440
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,320
things like what it does on the file

441
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,240
operating system uh what sort of files

442
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,600
it interacts with

443
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,480
and then what sort of network

444
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,120
connections it makes and then lastly

445
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,959
we've got visual similarity

446
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,880
so that is looking at things like

447
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,440
typically like office documents or pdfs

448
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,720
and they're commonly used in spear

449
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,800
phishing attacks to try and trick users

450
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,160
into opening a file

451
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,320
or clicking on something just like in

452
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,079
this example here trying to

453
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,079
enable editing to you know enable the

454
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,279
macros to

455
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,680
potentially compromise the user and so

456
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,120
again similarity search is extremely

457
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,560
useful and extremely powerful

458
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,680
and we should try and leverage that

459
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,480
wherever possible

460
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,320
lastly we come to tactics techniques and

461
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,639
procedures or ttps

462
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,000
now tcps help address some of the

463
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,360
problems i just talked about around rscs

464
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,000
because if we take david bianco's period

465
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,519
of pain as an example

466
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,279
we know that ifcs being at the bottom of

467
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,040
the pyramid are easily

468
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,320
replaceable and changed from an

469
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
attacker's perspective while ttps

470
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,320
at the top of the pyramid are much

471
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,759
harder to change

472
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,480
and even with apt attacks if we can get

473
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
them to change their ttps

474
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,240
we're making them waste and spend a lot

475
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,680
more time and resources

476
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,079
in order to do so and ultimately what

477
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,839
we're trying to do is

478
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,320
if they can assess and feel that type

479
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,160
making these changes is simply to

480
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
not worth their while they'll go and

481
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,600
then move on to something someone else

482
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,680
and again before we use ttps there's a

483
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,199
few things we should consider you know a

484
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,040
lot of ttps or some ttps

485
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,279
are simply too generic so for example if

486
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,880
i'm trying to classify an attacker

487
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,279
it uses spear phishing um it uses some

488
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,560
sort of encryption

489
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,240
they exfiltrate data in a compressed

490
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,480
format now even with all those three ttp

491
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,120
combined

492
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,880
that's really not saying too much nor is

493
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,240
it helping you classify any specific

494
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,560
attacker

495
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,639
now another thing that tcps don't tend

496
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,040
to do very well is we don't track it

497
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,600
as it evolves and what i mean by that if

498
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,519
we use the attack matrix

499
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,639
as an example we tend to use it in a

500
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,639
very very static way

501
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,880
so we keep adding more ttps associated

502
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,399
with an attacker

503
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,480
but a particular technique may have been

504
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,519
used just once

505
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,880
years and years ago so we should try and

506
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,360
use

507
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
time references so that we can see how

508
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,240
these ttps evolve

509
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,600
and also whether they're still relevant

510
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
for us

511
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,040
and then lastly we don't really tell

512
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,959
we can't oh sorry ttps don't generally

513
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,959
tell us which ones are being automated

514
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,480
from the attacker's perspective

515
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,600
and which ones are being manually

516
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,959
executed through the mail where they're

517
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,518
distributing

518
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,519
a bit of a technical detail here inside

519
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,199
one of these ttps right having said

520
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,799
everything that that we need for

521
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,160
consideration there's still a lot of

522
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,679
things that we can use with ttps that

523
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,280
can be very very interesting

524
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,839
now take this as an example we can

525
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,559
actually derive

526
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,160
iocs through this ttp now this is using

527
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,760
or this attacker is using a self-signed

528
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,599
certificate and inside that self-signed

529
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,760
certificate is a serial number

530
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,160
and so this attacker is reusing that

531
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,760
certificate with that serial number

532
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,600
over and over again and so you can

533
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
easily craft the yarra rule

534
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,960
and that will pick up all the malware

535
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,400
and potentially future variants of the

536
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,919
malware from this particular attacker

537
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
now the only problem with this is this

538
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,039
particular technique isn't very popular

539
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,799
and it's not commonly used today

540
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,960
because we're so used to iocs being

541
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,400
circulated around as

542
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,960
hashes ips domains and urls so that this

543
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,080
sort of information is often overlooked

544
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,480
or our tools are so commonly used in

545
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,919
incorporating those information

546
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,039
that we don't know how to make use of

547
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,080
this so keep this in mind that when

548
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,360
we're trying to incorporate additional

549
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,080
details

550
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,919
that we should be open into taking all

551
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,520
sorts of information and making use of

552
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,480
them wherever possible

553
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,320
now i talked about before some of the

554
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,640
tools that we can leverage sorry

555
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,559
no that's the next slide um

556
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,480
here we're talking about what sort of

557
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,320
ttps may be generated when a file is

558
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,000
being executed

559
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,320
so in this case i've just put up two

560
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
registry keys

561
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,960
and keep in mind how these ttps are

562
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,919
generally recorded

563
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,679
right they run through a sandbox and

564
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,520
automatically all that information is

565
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,039
recorded by the sandbox and then you get

566
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,240
a report out of it

567
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,760
but what they don't do is tell you how

568
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,919
commonly they're seeing how many files

569
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,600
or legitimate files it is associated

570
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,240
with

571
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,919
now the first one here if you run that

572
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,440
search through virustotal

573
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,000
you get 20 million results good and bad

574
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,640
now that's

575
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,240
really little value to us if we use that

576
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
tcp now if you can

577
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,760
now the only way to really address this

578
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,280
is you have a database big enough with

579
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,480
enough information

580
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,919
so that you can see how prevalent these

581
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,520
technical details are

582
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,559
so in that second example here

583
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,559
you actually see malware that's been

584
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,400
distributed by apt-28

585
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
with very little false positives because

586
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,160
common legitimate programs don't

587
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,919
tend to use this particular registry key

588
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,640
now i mentioned before about you know

589
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,960
some of the tools that we can leverage

590
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,240
um and i'll go through some of those

591
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,840
today on this particular slide

592
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,240
the first one is using something called

593
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,679
the attack navigator

594
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,440
and a lot of you may know about this

595
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,200
produced or developed by the guys over

596
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,240
at mitre

597
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,080
and it helps you understand all the

598
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,760
techniques that are available today

599
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,039
known to man

600
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,640
and this is constantly being updated a

601
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,720
couple of weeks ago we saw container

602
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,799
um techniques that were added more mac

603
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,280
os activities added and so forth

604
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,480
remember keep in mind that this is

605
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,840
constantly evolving and you need to go

606
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,559
back in time

607
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,840
you need to go back and constantly

608
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,600
re-evaluate this

609
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,240
now a great way to start understanding

610
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,120
what ttps your organizations can cover

611
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,200
is looking at the attack coverage or the

612
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,559
minor attack coverage

613
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,919
that your vendors have but you really

614
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:06,720
should test them

615
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,400
right looking at the or using the

616
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,640
mimikatz example as an example

617
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,120
it's not always what it seems so to test

618
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,960
it you can use tools like atomic red or

619
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,640
caldera

620
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,799
and that simulates attacks so that you

621
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,320
can go and see what is

622
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,760
being detected and prevented in your

623
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,000
tools as well as what logs are

624
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,760
generated so that you can wrap your own

625
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,280
rules around it whether it's in your

626
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,080
tools

627
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,960
uh in the tools itself or in a seam and

628
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,640
then you know find additional detections

629
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,559
and so forth

630
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,039
now for a more simplified approach you

631
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,280
can leverage a tool called detect

632
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,679
and this is generated again free tool by

633
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,159
the guys over at rabobank

634
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,320
and what this does is allows you to load

635
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,000
up sample log files across your

636
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,960
organizations

637
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,039
or you can interact with a gui and just

638
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,440
simply click on the tools that you have

639
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,679
and it automatically populates this heat

640
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,520
map across the matrix

641
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,280
as well as the different shades of color

642
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,120
to tell you how what percentage of

643
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
coverage you have in each of these

644
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,679
techniques

645
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,000
all these tools are free all these

646
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
capabilities are within well within your

647
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,159
graphs

648
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,000
for you to go and understand where your

649
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,679
gaps may be and where you want to spend

650
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,360
your time and resources in addressing

651
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,240
those gaps

652
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,159
now this is my last slide so you guys

653
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,480
can all go to morning tea after this

654
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,880
um campaigns do not end the day that

655
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,000
they discovered

656
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,280
or when the ttps and ics are published

657
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,600
in some rare cases they do but most of

658
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
the time they absolutely do not

659
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,880
attackers still leverage the same tools

660
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,559
or they evolve their tools to keep

661
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,720
compromising organizations

662
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,840
now let's take half of them as an

663
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,919
example we saw more organizations get

664
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:40,480
breached

665
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,400
after the attack was disclosed because

666
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,159
attackers knew how to leverage it an

667
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,760
organization simply tends to be slower

668
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,158
to keep up

669
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,880
now to summarize if we're just blindly

670
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,480
using threat intelligence without

671
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,679
context

672
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,520
all we're doing is simply adding very

673
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,880
expensive alerts

674
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,880
to our already inundated security teams

675
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,400
now i'm not saying that we can stop all

676
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,320
attacks that's absolutely not the case

677
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,280
here

678
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,480
but if we take some of the lessons

679
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,640
learned and apply

680
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,080
you know improve our use of threat

681
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,640
intelligence we can greatly reduce that

682
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
blind spot window or the dwell time

683
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,679
that attackers tend to have so

684
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,520
that is from the moment that attacker

685
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,799
gets through your defenses

686
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,720
to the time it takes for you to detect

687
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,200
understand and evaluate the impact

688
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,799
and then make an informed decision on

689
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,720
the best possible way to respond

690
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,650
