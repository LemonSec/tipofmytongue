00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,640
about

115
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,360
and in turn improve how security can be

116
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,920
done

117
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,400

security specialist

119
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,280
it's a fortune of speaking with a broad

120
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,120
range of different people advising

121
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
organizations around developing and

122
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,239
maturing their cyber security

123
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,840
capabilities

124
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,080
this work also often involves

125
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,360
collaboration across

126
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
a range of internal and external

127
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,680
stakeholders now that's complicated and

128
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,358
tricky so well done

129
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,040
to develop and improve the joint

130
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
solutions splunk and their security

131
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,479
ecosystem partners

132
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,520
bring to market to help solve a range of

133
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,600
cyber security challenges

134
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,360
so let's um let's just kick off

135
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,520
and what i'm going to do is i'll go the

136
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
opposite direction this time i'll start

137
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,880
up here

138
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
if each of you would like to just give

139
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,639
the audience a bit of a flavor a bit of

140
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,720
an overview of what we're thinking

141
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
where we're going uh what's the

142
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,840
direction

143
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
and obviously we're we're not too short

144
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,199
on time but

145
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,120
if i do the zipper thing that means

146
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,400
you're going too long

147
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,560
okay go for it thanks mike hopefully

148
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
that microphone's on but um

149
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,840
yeah look the way i sort of see it is

150
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,120
that we're sort of stuck in this state

151
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,960
from a security perspective of

152
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
constantly playing catch up or

153
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,240
constantly having to react

154
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,080
to sort of all the different challenges

155
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,440
that we're faced with um

156
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,960
from a security point of view so if we

157
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,479
look at it from the point of view of

158
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,240
simply just been able to support say

159
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,680
business transformation digital

160
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
transformation those types of things or

161
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,759
maybe getting the security basics sort

162
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,680
of right there's lots of fundamentals

163
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,039
that we need to probably do a better job

164
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,720
of getting right

165
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,320
and even looking at the ways that we

166
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,840
sort of deal with sort of

167
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,759
maybe the common metric of say dwell

168
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,360
time for instance and how long it takes

169
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,680
us

170
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
to find the important things or the

171
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
critical incidents and really sort of

172
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,600
see

173
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,479
uh soar as an opportunity in itself that

174
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:36,960
can

175
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,720
not only really help us to do things

176
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
faster but probably redirect and refocus

177
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,000
our efforts on

178
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,440
improving all of the things that really

179
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,680
matter so i really sort of see the

180
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,919
the the way that we should approach when

181
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,440
we're thinking about building out maybe

182
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,039
a saw capability as well

183
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,560
look at all the things we spend the most

184
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,639
time on work out how we can automate

185
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
those in a sensible way and then maybe

186
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
look at the resources we have in turn

187
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,759
available now

188
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,919
to maybe focus on some of those more

189
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,520
critical things to help us to improve

190
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,199
and maybe get in front of

191
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,479
what we need to think about from a

192
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,240
security perspective so

193
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,680
certainly said it's a big opportunity to

194
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,919
perhaps change the way that we approach

195
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,360
things so

196
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,240
indeed well said absolutely look it's

197
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
the next evolution of where we need to

198
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,080
be if we think back 10 15 years ago we

199
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,680
were dealing with spam and our

200
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,440
i.t people at the time were digging in

201
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,960
setting up spam filters and manually

202
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,919
clearing out

203
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,000
this is the next future for us is how do

204
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,160
we scale rapidly to use the advantages

205
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
of automation and orchestration to

206
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,600
actually apply the same logic

207
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,039
we don't think about spam anymore we

208
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,720
deal with three percent imagine if that

209
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,039
was in our security operation centers

210
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,639
we're our analysts who are overwhelmed

211
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,240
at the moment we're dealing 100

212
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,080
000 a million events a day what happens

213
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,000
when we hit a billion when iot really

214
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,960
hits and runs

215
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,639
and these hubs are the future where

216
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,960
technology converges so rapidly

217
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
just becomes an overwhelming challenge

218
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,639
the adversary is really good

219
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,919
they're disciplined they're thinking

220
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,599
it's no longer a 15 year old well

221
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,360
actually there are 15 year old kids out

222
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,479
there sitting there with their script

223
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,039
kitties

224
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,880
but the good guys the bad guys that are

225
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,240
out there are actually really good at

226
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,199
their trade craft

227
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,280
and they offer a significant challenge

228
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,199
our analysts are just as good but

229
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,400
they're overwhelmed with the sheer

230
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,840
volume of what they're dealing with

231
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,520
so we need to look at ways to actually

232
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
change the culture within the security

233
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,400
operations centers

234
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
so that this isn't actually a threat to

235
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,520
what they're doing but more about an

236
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,280
enablement of allowing them to focus on

237
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,919
the really

238
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,919
challenging wicked problems as opposed

239
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,280
to the volume crime that they're trying

240
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,159
to deal with every day

241
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,479
there's some there's some good 15 year

242
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,599
olds kicking around out there trying to

243
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,599
help out too so there is that

244
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,000
um so you know my point of view on this

245
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
is that um you know cyber security is

246
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,560
an intractably human problem like the

247
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,160
idea of people making mistakes that

248
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,199
allow

249
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,360
exploitation that predates the internet

250
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,039
by a couple of thousand years

251
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,639
um as does the idea of people taking

252
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,639
advantage of that for for their own for

253
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,240
their own gain so there's this element

254
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,400
of human creativity

255
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,879
that we're never going to fully remove

256
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,440
from

257
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,360
from you know what we're doing and our

258
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,560
work

259
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
but the counterpoint to that uh and this

260
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
actually it was you know coming from a

261
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,680
gartner conference in 2018

262
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,440
um you know risk-based vulnerability

263
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,879
management which is you know the space

264
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,360
that i

265
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,840
mostly play in uh had been a thing that

266
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,120
the cool kids were talking about for a

267
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,080
really long time

268
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,560
2018 felt like the year where everyone

269
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
realized that we're kind of screwed if

270
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,720
we don't

271
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,160
do that we're not going to get around to

272
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
all of it um and and where we're at now

273
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,440
i feel

274
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,919
as a kind of progression of that is this

275
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,759
mindset shift in security in general

276
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,680
from capability-based

277
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,440
you know programs and process and

278
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,880
approaches to security to one that's

279
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,159
risk-based

280
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
um because we have to and and that

281
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
involves the use of automation to

282
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,839
classify the use of automation to be

283
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,360
able to solve to make decisions on

284
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,679
behalf of the user guided by the user

285
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,959
they're really tying it back to the

286
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,880
analogy of the um almost the iron man

287
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,480
suit which is where i think saw comes

288
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,279
into it

289
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,680
the suit without the human is dumb but

290
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,440
the human without the suit is weak and i

291
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,959
think if we can get that pairing right

292
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,480
as we go forward that's how we solve

293
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,240
this problem

294
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,920
and i think it's really interesting

295
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,440
looking at it from the perspective of

296
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,560
being in a

297
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,680
sock team you're not going to be

298
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,200
automated out of a job

299
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
the aim of this isn't to automate you

300
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
out of a job the aim of this is to make

301
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,920
your job

302
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,000
way more fun you don't want to be

303
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,160
sending emails to users you don't want

304
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,560
to be

305
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,720
resetting passwords you want to be doing

306
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
cool stuff and focusing on things that

307
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,480
are actually important rather than

308
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,880
boring day-to-day work

309
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,600
and when it comes to security strategy

310
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
one of the big ones for me

311
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,399
is getting the boring things right and

312
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,080
doing that automation for the really

313
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,120
boring things

314
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,680
but also going back and focusing on the

315
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,640
basics

316
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,399
and getting the basics right from the

317
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,839
get-go so doing

318
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,160
proactive work and focusing on our

319
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,360
proactive rather than purely reactive

320
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,680
absolutely amazing couldn't agree more

321
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
now um

322
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,600
i did say that i don't want to do a lot

323
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
of talking here so

324
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,360
your goal everyone here everyone out in

325
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,480
virtual land

326
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,040
jump into the app and send through your

327
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,399
questions

328
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,160
so what we're going to do obviously is

329
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,600
they'll come through on the app

330
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,440
uh shortly adam's going to start reading

331
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,720
a few of those out

332
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,959
um please you obviously use this

333
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:11,920
opportunity

334
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,839
but there is a caveat i get in first

335
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,320
because as i said i love coming to this

336
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,760
conference because i get to meet all my

337
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,320
heroes

338
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,560
so i have a couple of questions first so

339
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,600
me first

340
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,680
all righty i've got a question for you

341
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,880
um

342
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,120
okay let's let's talk a little bit about

343
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,920
um

344
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,240
small business so a lot of enterprises

345
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,360
obviously reported

346
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,519
breaches you know we've had so many um

347
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,640
solar winds we have

348
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,320
ev everything that you could possibly

349
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,480
imagine has been a breach

350
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,120
assuming all of the businesses were

351
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,360
already adopting a saw approach

352
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,680
how could soar help a small to medium

353
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,839
business so the larger organizations

354
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,959
yeah okay they're probably

355
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,160
yeah if hopefully they're okay hasn't

356
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,560
stopped data breaches

357
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,959
in small business though what would you

358
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,800
suggest

359
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,680
uh let's go to who wants to take first

360
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,240
question

361
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,399
go for it it's actually a really good

362
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,160
one and my last job actually

363
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,399
tapped on this challenge quite well

364
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,079
working inside the health sector digital

365
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,360
health we were working with all our

366
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,959
partners out there in the um the health

367
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,320
sector delivering frontline health

368
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,200
services

369
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,120
imagine a small gp clinic that might

370
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,800
have five six doctors

371
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,040
the person who provides its support also

372
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
runs the reception and does a whole pile

373
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,839
of back stuff in that

374
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,440
and we sit down and work with them and

375
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,040
try and understand the challenges they

376
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,880
have in delivering their business

377
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,800
where their constraints are real world

378
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,560
they don't have the money to spend on a

379
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,839
security

380
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,680
analyst sitting in the environment and

381
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,200
we were always saying to this to these

382
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,079
people out there

383
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,000
find an msp that you can partner with so

384
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,440
you can actually leverage

385
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,959
the skill and the scale that they bring

386
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,720
to the equation in a cost effective

387
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,600
manner

388
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,760
with the an msp using something like the

389
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,200
sort framework and actually bringing it

390
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,160
all together

391
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,600
it actually means that this becomes a

392
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
commodity product that can actually be

393
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
delivered into the service

394
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,160
and allows people to move on with their

395
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,800
focus it's just unrealistic to expect

396
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,320
that people are going to be

397
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,160
delivering the specialty service like

398
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
healthcare and also being

399
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,600
astute enough to be able to deal with

400
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,800
the cyber challenge that's on the

401
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,519
landscape

402
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,680
right here and now they will get lost in

403
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,200
it and they will be sitting there in the

404
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,480
dark for ages

405
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,639
just getting wrecked on the side of the

406
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,560
road so this is an opportunity that i

407
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,480
think small business can partner with

408
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,680
now i know a lot of people are thinking

409
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,880
oh we're just going to push people

410
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,079
towards an msp

411
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,399
but so what msps are there to provide a

412
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,320
service the more people that consume

413
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,440
those services

414
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,200
drives competitiveness in the market and

415
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,560
then we'll be able to see this becoming

416
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,000
a cost-effective solution

417
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,079
we can't do it on our own and i think

418
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,240
saw inside an msp environment like a

419
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,279
sock as a service

420
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,320
really does move the needle yeah

421
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,720
to add to that um you know i spent a

422
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,680
decent chunk of time talking to

423
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,519
uh you know how do we how do we bake

424
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,200
security and like how do we prioritize

425
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,320
security um as a startup like

426
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,760
getting hacked is not your biggest

427
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,680
threat at that stage like your next

428
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,959
payroll is so

429
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,480
how do we approach this from a rational

430
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,320
standpoint and to your point like

431
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,079
really the idea of like in sourcing the

432
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,360
things that are core and then

433
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,880
outsourcing as much of the context as

434
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,240
you possibly can

435
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320
actually viewing that as a way to to be

436
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,000
able to double down on value

437
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,040
that you're building into the business

438
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,880
but the benefit of that on this side of

439
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,079
the question is that

440
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,519
you know you're either automating or

441
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,600
leaving some of the security aspects to

442
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,720
the people who actually have

443
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,000
defined expertise around those

444
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,920
particular things so it's it's

445
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,240
a question of economic rationalism as

446
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,920
much as it is you know staying sane i

447
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,120
think

448
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,440
you now i think as an example perhaps of

449
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
of something that we see

450
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,000
often from an automation first use case

451
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,440
point of view is um

452
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
automation of investigations of phishing

453
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,279
emails so if we think about

454
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,040
i mean phishing is a challenge we're

455
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
faced with continually

456
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,959
and small business doesn't matter what

457
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,560
size of organization

458
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,639
you are it's a problem you need to deal

459
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,639
with and if you can actually take that

460
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,519
on board

461
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,040
build an automation use case that's

462
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,639
going to cover investigations

463
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,240
of those phishing emails as a small

464
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,600
business that's one less thing you

465
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,800
potentially need

466
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,959
to worry about and it's certainly

467
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,079
something that

468
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,600
customers large and small they're all

469
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,959
usually starting with something along

470
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,480
those lines as their first use case when

471
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,600
it comes to automation because it's

472
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,839
usually the same process

473
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,839
emails are all traditionally the same

474
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,199
type of thing we can feed into the

475
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,720
automation engine and run through a

476
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
standard process to

477
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,000
to investigate and make a determination

478
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,839
is it likely to be fishing or not

479
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,440
and then determine what to do after that

480
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,519
maybe pass it to human for four next

481
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,800
steps or something like that but that's

482
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,399
that's probably a really fantastic place

483
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,079
to start

484
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,399
and i really liked anthony's point about

485
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,120
utilizing

486
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,680
msps and mssps because you get the

487
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,959
benefit then

488
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,120
of their experience not just dealing

489
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,560
with your organization

490
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,399
but with a whole range of other

491
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,839
organizations they're getting threat

492
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:48,720
intelligence

493
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,360
from so much more than just your org so

494
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
you get to leverage that so

495
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,040
while it may look like a large cost

496
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,399
you are getting so much more from that

497
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,279
right i suppose one of the follow-ups on

498
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:03,760
that

499
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,839
and look there are questions coming

500
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,760
through that's awesome i will

501
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,440
i promise i will shut up in a moment

502
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,880
just one more thing

503
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,920
um obviously and tony you mentioned that

504
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,240
the

505
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,720
drive to msps and you know obviously

506
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,320
that'll bring competitiveness

507
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,199
and price or competitive prices down one

508
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,959
thing that concerns me and having having

509
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:23,920
known a lot of

510
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,800
people in not cyber security but in pure

511
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,760
i.t

512
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,880
that have not potentially the best

513
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,600
approach to cyber security and a lot of

514
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,120
those obviously sort of hang up their

515
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,639
shingle and say right you know

516
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,399
his bargain bob's pc sales store and you

517
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,279
know

518
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,839
here's your antivirus endpoint product

519
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,120
thingy protection just go

520
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,959
use that you'll be fine and and you know

521
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,639
there's businesses obviously purchasing

522
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,440
these things

523
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,000
so i guess where i'm going with with my

524
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,560
thinking

525
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,920
is the industry probably needs training

526
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,800
programs

527
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,320
or incentives or something to drive

528
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,000
those small operators

529
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,759
towards some of the things that we're

530
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,759
talking about here does anyone have any

531
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,800
thoughts on

532
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,199
are there existing programs uh do you

533
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,160
have any suggestions

534
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,320
i think the the the past providers like

535
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,519
uh you know

536
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,000
the different folks that are basically

537
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,519
trying to enable the cloud

538
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,600
for all sorts of different companies

539
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,880
like ranging

540
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
they're scaling vertically so you can

541
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,399
you can procure it as a

542
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,480
you know small business or a startup you

543
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,240
can use it as an enterprise

544
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,320
seeing more and more of these like sore

545
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,360
like features

546
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,079
creep in because they can it's like okay

547
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,759
we've got visibility we've got telemetry

548
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,440
we've got the ability to act

549
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,240
um that's all stuff that we can do as an

550
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,079
organization it's becoming a value added

551
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,440
something that you know we can be

552
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
suggestive around if we identify

553
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,880
something really silly that's about to

554
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,600
happen

555
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,759
or we can make it configurable by the by

556
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,959
the user and the owner

557
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,680
yeah i love the concept of make secure

558
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,000
uh

559
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,720
make insecure obvious and secure easy

560
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,160
just as a solution

561
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,079
premise um and looking for the folks

562
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,520
that are really trying to trying to do

563
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,319
that

564
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,359
i don't feel like that's a solved

565
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,720
problem yet by any stretch of the

566
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,000
imagination but there's people that are

567
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,520
really actively trying to approach it in

568
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,559
that way and i think

569
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,079
you know finding those is part of the

570
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,679
answer to the question

571
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,599
all right i actually think that's a good

572
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,679
example too um one of the challenges

573
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,520
back in digital health was working with

574
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,000
these

575
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,839
small healthcare provider organizations

576
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,439
that were trying to run their own team

577
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,280
and picking up commodity services like a

578
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,799
cloud provider who actually

579
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,799
bakes in the foundation stuff that

580
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,880
traditional i.t would always be doing is

581
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,400
a really good way to jumpstart the

582
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,039
thinking

583
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,799
and start to look at how you can take

584
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,080
advantage of it

585
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
no one's going to rock up and expect an

586
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,480
azure an aws or a vault out there not to

587
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,880
provide you foundation hygiene products

588
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,559
built into the solution as a minimum

589
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,240
sort of basic requirement

590
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,160
so that's i think the first conversation

591
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,919
about well this is how you can

592
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,919
take advantage of atscale enterprise

593
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,840
technologies to deliver a solution and

594
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,360
then you can have that next conversation

595
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,640
with your technologist

596
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,559
about right the paradigm has shifted

597
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,080
it's no longer about a room full of

598
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,520
blinking lights it's about

599
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,360
a capability that you plug into to

600
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,880
deliver the business outcome

601
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,600
brilliant okay i think we're definitely

602
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,720
going to get somewhere with those

603
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,679
approaches

604
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,000
i'm going to uphold my promise and shut

605
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
up now i'll reintroduce the wonderful

606
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,679
adam and we have questions coming in

607
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,559
from from you

608
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,240
so thank you we do indeed we've got some

609
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,520
great questions coming through already

610
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,120
now you can identify a particular person

611
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,240
on the panel you might want to set the

612
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,440
question to or the question goes to the

613
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,640
entire panel

614
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,440
john asks how do state government

615
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,480
departments

616
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,280
with large technical debt reliance on

617
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,360
state id provider and no funding thank

618
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,640
you covert stimulus

619
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,679
get on top of things state government

620
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,520
departments anyone got any insights

621
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,240
how we can help them oh yes i have

622
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,000
worked for a state government department

623
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,679
so i have been there i have been in the

624
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,919
trenches i spent eight years working for

625
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,840
a queensland state government department

626
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,640
um a lot of it comes down to the people

627
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,760
i'm really sorry

628
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,799
there's no quick and easy fix um

629
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,320
you need to fight for it um unless you

630
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,200
have

631
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,400
the drive and the stubbornness and the

632
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,360
snark

633
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,679
to push for the changes that you want to

634
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,760
see in your organization it will not get

635
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,480
done

636
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,320
um you need to make sure you are carving

637
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,559
out time for that proactive work

638
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,080
in order to make sure that you are

639
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,919
making efficiencies and improvements

640
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,080
in your organization because you don't

641
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,760
have the budget and you don't have the

642
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,799
tools and

643
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,559
you do have a lot of legacy that you

644
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,160
need to deal with um

645
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,919
an example of that is a project that i

646
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,679
worked on to try and get rid of

647
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,600
server 2003 from the department that i

648
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
work from and it took me

649
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,880
nearly two years by myself i was it

650
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,799
i was the project manager i was the

651
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,880
operations i was the security person i

652
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,080
was everything

653
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,679
if you want to see it done you're the

654
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,000
one that has to do it

655
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,600
i think going back to something i think

656
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,919
casey mentioned before the idea of a

657
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,440
risk based or i like to say risk

658
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,960
prioritized approach you're not going to

659
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,600
be able to do

660
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,840
everything all at once you need to focus

661
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,440
on the most important things first take

662
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,280
them off move forward and maybe

663
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,720
shift your priorities as you move

664
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,159
forward because the landscape's

665
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,840
constantly changing as well too so i

666
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,400
think

667
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,840
getting a list together working on the

668
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,200
most important things forward and then

669
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,799
moving moving on from there

670
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,720
the interesting thing i mean it is we

671
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,159
always love having a laugh at how

672
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,320
you know anachronistic and dinosaur-like

673
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,919
government are but government also is so

674
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,679
big that when government gets something

675
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,840
right or does it well you're looking in

676
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840
like the covert app in new south wales

677
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,000
and that when that just clicked in

678
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,159
and just removed 25 other different

679
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,480
attempted systems and in just this step

680
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,600
changes so that it's worth encouraging

681
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,799
government to get things right isn't

682
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,640
because they're such big beasts that if

683
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,679
they

684
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,559
deal with a problem it's it's dealt with

685
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,600
does that make sense

686
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,559
yeah it i completely agree i think part

687
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,280
of that

688
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,799
there was a tweet that went out this

689
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,919
morning um colonial is advertising for a

690
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,679
cyber security manager

691
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,320
uh literally that went out today so so

692
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,760
the whole idea of

693
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,480
you know large organizations that have

694
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,600
enormous sprawl

695
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,919
like legacy systems tech debt almost

696
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,120
built into their business model and

697
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,159
they're having to figure out how to

698
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,520
secure that and how to move forward and

699
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,880
then you've got this layer of

700
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,039
you know bureaucracy to handle on top as

701
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,039
all large organizations do but tends to

702
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,559
be more pronounced

703
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,640
in the government sector and places like

704
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,400
oil and gas

705
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
you're not alone i think to your point

706
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
you know the idea of saying like

707
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,760
our role as an industry is to partner

708
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,600
with you and to actually try to help

709
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,080
that and and frankly you know reward the

710
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,880
wins when

711
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,480
if and when they do happen anthony do

712
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,360
you want that something that's going to

713
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,960
say following onward from that

714
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,480
government's good when the challenges

715
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
honor the fires at the door so covert

716
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,760
was a great example of how

717
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,039
we could actually break down those

718
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,039
traditional barriers and get things out

719
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,799
like the covert app and integrate with

720
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,600
um the

721
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,120
uh the vendors out there and get things

722
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,520
done quickly what i find though is that

723
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,080
um

724
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,600
if you sit back and let it coast back

725
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,919
into bau that's when the old thinking

726
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,600
comes into play and um

727
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,520
the tradition of we'll just double down

728
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,200
on our technology debt we'll just do a

729
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,000
windows 2003-2008 upgrade

730
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
we won't look at a cloud adoption

731
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,440
strategy that's too hard

732
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,600
we're too complex we can't do that yet i

733
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,120
think also that

734
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,880
they fail to take an opportunity to look

735
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,559
at the business benefits and actually

736
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,600
turn around say

737
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,520
yes it's going to cost money now but in

738
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,360
three years we're going to pick up a 30

739
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,600
our 30 productivity improvement we've

740
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,120
got to wear the heat now to get the

741
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,400
benefits in the future

742
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,000
jeff asks a question that touches on

743
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
something i was going to mention as well

744
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,200
in this the whole automation space

745
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,960
when i was growing up one of my best

746
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,360
mates dads worked for the roadside

747
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,320
assistance

748
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,919
that they have in in nrma they have it

749
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,000
at all the different state things

750
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,720
excuse me alright so your car breaks

751
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,200
down

752
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,520
he's the expert and this guy was a

753
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,600
superstar with cars he used to rebuild

754
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
things in his backyard he was amazing

755
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,960
and 95 98 of his job was

756
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,440
keys locked in car or i've left the

757
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,360
lights on the battery's gone flat

758
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
and you had these genius mechanics that

759
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,720
were just driving around

760
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,960
recharging batteries and jimmying

761
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,559
windows that was all they ever did

762
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,640
and i had a crap oh my first car was a

763
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,840
total box

764
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,600
and it would break down in the most

765
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,960
innovative ways

766
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,679
and so the nrma guys and girls loved me

767
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,280
because they come to my car go

768
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,200
oh wow so you haven't locked the key oh

769
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,960
wow

770
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,559
i think that's actually melted onto that

771
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,360
oh i get to do i get to do some stuff so

772
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,640
jeff asked is human creativity something

773
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,080
that's going to be harder to cultivate

774
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,600
in an automated environment the way i

775
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,360
was going to ask it is

776
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,320
what is it that humans do best what is

777
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,240
the creativity what is the one of you

778
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,760
use the phrase

779
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,240
the wicked problems anthony what's the

780
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,400
sweet spot that humans do

781
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,919
so much better than automation at the

782
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,760
moment and how do we make sure that

783
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,720
creativity

784
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,360
and human side remains active in the

785
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,400
system

786
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,640
look my view on this one's quite simple

787
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,919
the saw framework so if you look at the

788
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,360
automation and you get the volume crime

789
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,000
off the table

790
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,919
and the wicked problems all the analysts

791
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,080
are dealing with the human mind with

792
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,919
orchestration tools will actually allow

793
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,679
them to move quickly and more agilely

794
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:58,080
through

795
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,760
but it'll also give them the ability to

796
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,120
look at the lessons learned from

797
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,799
previous ways that orchestration was

798
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,880
brought to bear look at for example

799
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,120
who is the person who solved this

800
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,720
particular type of challenge out of the

801
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,440
sock team

802
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,200
and how can i go and leverage from them

803
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,799
and what did that person have in unique

804
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,679
skills

805
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,760
i see the linkage there is where the

806
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,840
ability for humans to start to take a

807
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,799
real leading edge

808
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,640
because yes ai is around the corner and

809
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,000
business machine learning is

810
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,679
sorry machine learning is there all day

811
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,120
every day but it's

812
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,039
never going to truly take it out of the

813
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,559
equation of actually needing a smart

814
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,200
analyst

815
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,480
who can look at the problem and the

816
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,080
trade craft that the individual brings

817
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,799
to beer

818
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,640
and say right what is this adversary

819
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,159
doing differently why am i

820
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,159
seeing two nation states working

821
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,080
together bringing two distinct sets of

822
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,000
trade craft into an equation

823
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,240
and how do i build a profile for the

824
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,360
future attack

825
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,400
because that's what we need to think

826
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,240
about we can deal with today's problem

827
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,840
but it's the next attack and the next

828
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,520
tradecraft evolution that we need to be

829
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,679
working towards

830
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,400
yeah this is a kind of a you know a

831
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:56,960
created

832
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,799
category on the thesis that we need to

833
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,440
scale access to human creativity in in

834
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
our domain that's

835
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,240
kind of why i'm on stage right now so i

836
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,600
clearly believe in the importance of

837
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,640
this question

838
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,679
um i think to characterize it

839
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,279
you know there's a there's a concept in

840
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,960
in machine learning called supervised

841
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,520
ml um where and i think it actually

842
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,679
characterizes what machine learning and

843
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,600
some of those different kind of

844
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,919
next generation call it approaches to

845
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:22,960
automation

846
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,120
actually do the supervision part is the

847
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,080
human

848
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,159
so so there's this feedback loop and

849
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,600
there's human creativity that's being

850
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,240
applied in order to train the machine

851
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,760
in a way that you know it can then

852
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,200
extract the things that are repeatable

853
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,400
and that's where you get your leverage

854
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,039
right

855
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,679
so you know there's already um i think

856
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,120
constructs that exist i feel like

857
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,720
they've been oversold to some degree

858
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,880
um you know i was literally in in the

859
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,320
bay area in 2015

860
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
which to me was like the peak of the

861
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,840
hype cycle around ai is going to solve

862
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,720
everything

863
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,840
it didn't um and that's because it was a

864
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,200
shiny thing that we could we could talk

865
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,000
about and sell

866
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,679
but we didn't necessarily know how to

867
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,679
you know apply it to the user's problem

868
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,200
in the same way and kind of got called

869
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,000
out in that process

870
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,200
and we didn't do that but that was the

871
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,400
thing that collected league ways in the

872
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,840
industry i feel did at that point in

873
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,559
time

874
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,960
so you know there's this idea of like

875
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,799
this is already how it's meant to work

876
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,320
these systems have been built to do this

877
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,000
in the first place i think jess made an

878
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,919
excellent point around you know trying

879
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,600
to remove as much of the intimidation

880
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,080
factor

881
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,679
and the replacement factor from the

882
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,440
operators and from the users as possible

883
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
because it's a real concern

884
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,039
but then on a practical level it really

885
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,720
is about the interface you know for the

886
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,240
human to understand that this is not

887
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,200
here

888
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,400
to you know replace your job or it's not

889
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,440
even here to replace

890
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,200
aspects of your thoughtfulness that you

891
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,799
apply to your job this is here to give

892
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,120
you leverage like your creativity and

893
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,960
your ability to problem solve ahead of

894
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,919
the problem

895
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,360
that's what you can do computers are

896
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,200
there to repeat what you've come up with

897
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,960
am i right it goes one step further in

898
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,880
an industry that i often hear every year

899
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,520
i hear this

900
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,880
you want to get more people into this

901
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,400
industry you want to get more young

902
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,320
people considering this as a career

903
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,760
well the more they can look and go

904
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,919
actually this is a place where your

905
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,640
creativity is vital and it's an industry

906
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,480
where more and more you're going to be

907
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:02,960
doing

908
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,520
the creative fun sexy iron man suit

909
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,480
stuff

910
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
not just churning out emails and telling

911
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,919
people have you turned it on

912
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,679
can you turn it off again and turn it

913
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,919
back on that's that's an enticement to

914
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,840
get people into this career isn't it

915
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,679
but not only that from my perspective as

916
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,679
well it the creativity is really

917
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,480
important

918
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,000
and the information that you have in

919
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,159
your head is really important we can't

920
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,080
we are not very good at being able to

921
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,679
teach computers everything that we have

922
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,799
in our heads

923
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,279
and your organizational knowledge your

924
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,520
knowledge of your infrastructures

925
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,000
it's ai and machine learning can help

926
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,120
with that

927
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,039
but it can't replace you it can't

928
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,960
replace the knowledge you have about

929
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,760
your users and your systems so we still

930
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,240
need

931
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,840
really talented sock operators and

932
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,279
analysts to be able to be that human

933
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,799
interface to be able to spot those

934
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,760
things that

935
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,000
the computer doesn't realize are weird

936
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,520
yeah so automation

937
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,240
and ai ml are ways to give humans better

938
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,120
information and make

939
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,720
better decisions at the end of the day

940
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,320
so i think simon asks a question about

941
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,159
exactly this simon says what risks do

942
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,320
you see with the push to ai

943
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,840
mlis saw capabilities and the push to

944
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,480
sell the

945
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,440
shiny over the real benefits of

946
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,399
automation

947
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,399
yeah look it's it's an interesting one

948
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,240
and i mean even if you go back before

949
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,039
aiml saw there was always that sort of

950
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,799
idea of the silver bullet we'll buy a

951
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,080
piece of technology and it's going to

952
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,600
solve all of our problems but i think

953
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,880
it's a case of

954
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,399
before we even get to those points of

955
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,000
using those advanced

956
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,760
you may say advanced technologies like

957
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,240
aiml we better get the basics right

958
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,520
otherwise the outcomes are just not

959
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,720
going to be what we need to have and i

960
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,760
think saw

961
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,760
itself offers a pathway to help get

962
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,880
those basics right

963
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,559
and in the sense of what i was saying at

964
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,240
the start where we can take the

965
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,520
resources that we have

966
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
the limited resources that we have and

967
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,039
focus on getting the basics or the

968
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,799
foundations right to look at things like

969
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,080
ai and ml

970
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,600
and make sure we can get the best out of

971
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,520
those as well so i think

972
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,039
it's hard it's a challenge in the sense

973
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,960
that everyone is naturally attracted to

974
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,120
the idea that we're going to be able to

975
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,799
quickly and easily solve a problem with

976
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,320
very very little effort but the reality

977
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,279
unfortunately is

978
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,520
not necessarily always the same as that

979
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,120
so i think in terms of

980
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,559
making sure we're able to get the basics

981
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,080
or the foundations right before we start

982
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,360
to move to those things is critically

983
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,159
important

984
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,840
go on one step further from that the

985
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,200
real risk is here that

986
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,799
if we don't bring an orchestration

987
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,880
automation process into our thinking

988
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,480
around managing stocks and security

989
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,760
intelligence centers

990
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,440
we run the bigger risk of losing our

991
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,559
good people because they're going to be

992
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,640
dealing with rubbish day in and day out

993
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,799
and smart people do not stay where

994
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,480
organizations where they can't actually

995
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,600
grow and evolve

996
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,279
this gives us an ability to actually

997
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,360
take the workforce to the next level

998
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,960
we're never going to fix the background

999
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,640
problem of trying to fill a

1000
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,720
shortfall on cyber across the armed

1001
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,080
sector we need to teach our

1002
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,360
technologists to deliver better

1003
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,120
technology we need to take advantage of

1004
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,720
tooling orchestration

1005
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,159
bringing all of the technologies

1006
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,760
together average

1007
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,200
console operators must probably sitting

1008
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,960
in front of six or seven interfaces

1009
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,640
jumping from one environment to another

1010
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,159
to work out what's going on

1011
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,840
so will bring that together and give an

1012
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
ability to see the data

1013
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
in a systematic approach that's where

1014
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,679
they get to grow and evolve and we can

1015
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,720
actually keep our people

1016
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,480
focused by giving them things that are

1017
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,240
challenging wicked not going to work for

1018
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,840
you because you pay me 10

1019
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,440
more and go across the vendor you're

1020
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,720
going to work for me because i give you

1021
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,600
a challenge that

1022
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
forces you to evolve and i can give you

1023
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,120
a career pathway that actually allows

1024
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,640
you to be something that's the risk i

1025
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,760
think we're truly running

1026
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,240
as individual business operators casey

1027
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,360
then a couple more quick questions yeah

1028
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,159
for sure

1029
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,679
um i think we've already seen this in

1030
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,760
terms of risk this is a great question

1031
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,159
so

1032
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,080
you know i was around doing solution

1033
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,159
stuff when when waff

1034
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,720
became a thing um and prior to that when

1035
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,760
ids ips

1036
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,000
became a thing it was sold in a way like

1037
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,279
here's this magical new

1038
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,200
automation that you just plug in and it

1039
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,880
blocks all the bad guys and great and

1040
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,080
all of a sudden you've got you know

1041
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,480
irish people unable to log into your

1042
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,440
website because they've got an

1043
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,000
apostrophe

1044
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,679
in their name right so we've seen this

1045
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,039
movie before

1046
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,559
um in terms of it being undersold or

1047
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,360
mischaracterized

1048
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,600
in its nature so the whole idea of saw

1049
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,640
coming in and just yep

1050
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,080
we're going to replace everything we're

1051
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,440
just going to know everything's going on

1052
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,000
in your network

1053
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,480
you can you can go over rest now the

1054
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,320
risk is that there's either unintended

1055
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,480
consequences or it fails to deliver

1056
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,000
in a way that the business you know

1057
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,679
basically takes as a cue to rip it all

1058
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,120
out and just abandon the whole idea in

1059
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,399
the first place i think that's a real

1060
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:16,799
risk

1061
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,960
in this space because you know no one

1062
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,840
really knows and

1063
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,240
the the definition of ai like get three

1064
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,919
people in the in a room and ask them all

1065
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,360
to define it and all say different

1066
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,240
things

1067
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,159
joe asks a question that was touched on

1068
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,760
slightly with your example of the small

1069
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,039
doctor surgery where i loved it the

1070
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,000
receptionist is also

1071
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,960
the i.t expert joe asks is there a base

1072
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,720
level of maturity

1073
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,640
that an organization needs to be able to

1074
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,399
effectively implement

1075
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,679
soar no

1076
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,840
i don't think so i think you're better

1077
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,559
off doing something than nothing

1078
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,200
um you're not going to get it perfect to

1079
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,640
start with you're not going to have it

1080
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,559
perfected straight away and

1081
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,360
saw and any of the automation pieces

1082
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,960
they're not going to be set and forget

1083
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,640
you are going to be constantly tuning

1084
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
them and constantly monitoring them

1085
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,000
and making tweaks so doing something and

1086
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,840
getting started with something

1087
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,039
is going to put you in a better position

1088
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,120
straight away rather than just going

1089
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,840
it's too hard i can't deal with it

1090
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,519
i can't get it perfect straight away so

1091
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,600
i'm not going to bother yeah look it's a

1092
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,440
common thing that i've seen anyway in

1093
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,159
the sense that customers i speak to uh

1094
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,480
talking well i'm not ready i'm not

1095
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,440
mature enough

1096
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,039
to look at technologies like that where

1097
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,880
i think it's it's the opposite it could

1098
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,279
be a tool that can help you to

1099
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,440
build maturity faster and one of the

1100
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,720
first things when you're looking at

1101
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,240
building out a saw capability is

1102
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,600
understanding the process and quite

1103
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,360
often we don't understand the process we

1104
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,039
haven't defined what that process needs

1105
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:43,760
to be

1106
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,120
and the first step if you're looking to

1107
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
automate something is building a mind

1108
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,960
map of what that process looks like and

1109
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,559
understanding how it works

1110
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,159
looking for the opportunities to build

1111
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,080
that automation and plenty of the sore

1112
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,200
tools out there

1113
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,360
a part of that is is if you like what

1114
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,519
could be called a case template so watch

1115
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,279
other steps that i should follow for a

1116
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,960
particular type of incident that i might

1117
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,039
need to investigate or respond

1118
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,760
defining that and all the the saw tools

1119
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,399
i've seen

1120
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,559
offer that capability so defining that

1121
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,679
as the first step and then

1122
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,840
looking for avenues or areas that you

1123
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,120
can automate as part of

1124
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,799
what that process is once you understand

1125
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,399
what that process so i think it's the

1126
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,080
opposite it offers the opportunity to

1127
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,120
build maturity

1128
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,399
an anonymous question here many

1129
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,159
organizations are investing heavily in

1130
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,640
recruiting technical experts and socks

1131
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,159
are we investing enough in digital

1132
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,000
literacy cultural change

1133
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,919
managing our data better now as i said

1134
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,279
i'm a conference mc

1135
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,960
so i know for a fact whenever a question

1136
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,799
says are we investing enough in

1137
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,120
dot dot dot the answer is no we're not

1138
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,640
we should be investing a lot more

1139
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,919
don't give me that actually

1140
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,640
drill down here a little bit

1141
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,760
what do what what can we realistically

1142
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,880
do here to bring about

1143
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,760
significant changes in digital literacy

1144
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,039
or cultural change what's the

1145
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,399
low hanging fruit there i think with

1146
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,760
within an organization

1147
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,200
um something that i've seen be really

1148
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,880
successful that i think anyone can pick

1149
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,640
up and use is the idea of security

1150
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,679
champions

1151
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,760
so you know identify the people within

1152
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,880
whatever realm

1153
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,399
of the organization they might they may

1154
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,918
not work for the security team but

1155
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:10,719
they've got

1156
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,960
an inclination and a mental model that's

1157
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,480
going to actually make them effective in

1158
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,760
teaching others

1159
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,599
so it's like how can you get leverage

1160
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,879
from from folks that are going to be

1161
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,000
natural champions within the

1162
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,918
organization just starting the process

1163
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,079
of identifying who those people could be

1164
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,560
um that to me is is a is a pretty quick

1165
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,079
win as a step zero

1166
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,000
gotta jump in agree on that um my last

1167
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,359
job we actually kicked off a little

1168
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,960
program where we spent about twenty two

1169
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,000
thousand dollars

1170
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,599
got ten people through their sis and

1171
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,879
they were out of the workforce and they

1172
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,000
weren't allowed to have a cyber

1173
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,639
background

1174
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,760
they weren't allowed to come from

1175
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,359
technology and we got the advocacy

1176
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,320
working there

1177
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,440
one of the other things that i've seen

1178
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,040
really working well in the health sector

1179
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,599
was

1180
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,199
get in early with the new workforce

1181
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,879
coming on and help them understand the

1182
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:49,440
literal

1183
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,119
literacy so they can become the

1184
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,040
advocates we're seeing doctors now

1185
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,119
emerging into the actual workforce who

1186
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,879
are digitally literate who understand

1187
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,920
the challenges

1188
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,599
and can communicate that in a meaningful

1189
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,440
way to their peers what actually changes

1190
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,240
the paradigm

1191
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,599
it's no longer a tech head with his

1192
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,200
rotors spinning on the top of his head

1193
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,400
trying to sell them something it's

1194
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,839
actually the business saying

1195
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,200
this is going to bite us we need to

1196
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,800
actually look at this for the future and

1197
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,240
it talks to how we handle their

1198
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,160
data better fantastic i'm mindful of

1199
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,119
time because we're switching to the

1200
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,480
virtual event role everybody kept saying

1201
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,440
a couple of questions i'm going to go

1202
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,240
through get quick

1203
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,839
short sharp answers from you gauche asks

1204
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,520
when a company gets hit with ransomware

1205
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,599
do you advise pay the ransom or try and

1206
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,520
fix the data to get it back just one

1207
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,119
word each from the four of you either

1208
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:29,760
pay

1209
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,160
or fix starting here going along the

1210
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,760
line pay off fix

1211
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,680
i'd have to say fix i don't know fix

1212
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,960
tough questions first

1213
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,280
fix unanimous on fix okay and there's a

1214
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,480
final question here what are the key

1215
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,480
factors for a successful saw

1216
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,839
implementation and what's stopping

1217
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:44,960
organizations

1218
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,640
from making progress in this space so

1219
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,960
i'll go down the line just one big

1220
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,160
inspirational

1221
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,240
if you're trying to sell this message

1222
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,760
right for people who want to go and have

1223
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,359
this discussion with organizations about

1224
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,200
this is why we need to do it

1225
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,119
what is the key to this being successful

1226
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,880
what's the selling point of this

1227
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,480
what really drives it home as we go down

1228
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,720
the panel i think

1229
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,880
you've got to start with measurement so

1230
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,000
measuring

1231
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,040
where time is spent measuring then

1232
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,720
as you go through the process to build

1233
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,440
out your sort of automation capability

1234
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,359
what's working where the improvements

1235
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,599
are coming from and identifying where

1236
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,280
else you need to maybe spend time so i

1237
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,640
think i'd say

1238
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,800
how you measure what is important what

1239
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,000
takes the most time has been

1240
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,800
key anthony absolutely 3x to 10x

1241
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,400
improvement on stock productivity

1242
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,160
just get it simple that's your own

1243
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
conversation point with your executive

1244
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,119
casey uh get your definition right like

1245
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,880
soar is a product it's something that

1246
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,000
you can buy and put in

1247
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,560
but you know before that it's a strategy

1248
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,160
it's a decision it's a north star that

1249
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,599
you're orienting your organization

1250
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,040
around so put time into that get that

1251
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,320
right first

1252
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,400
jess i like what anthony had to say i

1253
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,839
think it's about being able to retain

1254
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:52,720
your staff

1255
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,440
if you have them doing boring mindless

1256
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,520
bland tasks all the time they are going

1257
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,160
to leave

1258
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,040
and you're going to lose that

1259
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,800
organizational knowledge and sore will

1260
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,240
help them

1261
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,920
stay motivated and stay interested in

1262
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,119
the work that they are doing and they

1263
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,400
will stay with your company

1264
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,520
what a wonderful way to finish what a

1265
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,560
tremendous panel to get us started

1266

that up the back of the room without all

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,839
on the front of the stage i've spoken

1288
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:46,880
with troy extensively

1289
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,960
we've planned nothing it could be a very

1290
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,280
very awkward 35 or so minutes unless you

1291
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,240
really hit us but there must be

1292
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,680
questions you want to ask of the guy

1293
