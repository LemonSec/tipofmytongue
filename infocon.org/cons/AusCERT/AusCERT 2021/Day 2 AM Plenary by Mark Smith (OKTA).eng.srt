and native applications we might have

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,439
time for a couple of questions again hit

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,199
us up through the q a function on the

16
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:29,679
app

17
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,920
ladies and gentlemen from octa to speak

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,960
on simplifying and

19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,120
automating identity-centric processes at

20
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,399
scale mark smith

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,760
thank you and uh and good morning

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,360
i've got the next 20 minutes to talk to

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,280
you about octa workflows

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,079
uh as i was introduced my name is mark

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,800
smith

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,559
i work for octa uh so before we go to

27
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,039
the first slide or the next slide after

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:00:59,520
this

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,640
um i'm going to be talking about octa

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,760
workflows but

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,920
the actual title up there the simplify

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,080
and automate identity centric processes

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,320
at scale

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,720
so our octa workflows is

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,960
identity-centric and so i've underlined

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,680
that to make it

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,720
quite clear and differentiate um

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,799
octa workflows from you know other

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,080
workflow tools

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,920
that are more business-centric and so

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,280
i'm going to be talking about

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,520
now how how octo workflows can actually

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,320
be used uh in identity-centric processes

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,400
there we go all right fantastic okay

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,840
so those that uh you know

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,399
may have heard opt to speak before uh

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,520
where we fit in the mark

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,320
is that um we're totally agnostic we're

49
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,479
really trying to connect everything

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,399
uh so we're not really aligned with one

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,880
product stack uh our goal is to connect

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,520
everything

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,600
and actually with octa workflows that

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,040
that further increases

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,520
our reach uh and so we can actually

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,600
onboard and connect even more

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,959
uh systems uh to be used in you know the

58
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,000
identity system

59
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,959
okay so for a while now octa has

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,360
or part of octa has been uh lcm lcm

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,599
stands for life cycle management

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,319
also known as user provisioning the

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,080
reason why opticals at lifecycle

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,239
management is because it's more just

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,680
than provisioning

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,959
when you think of provisioning you think

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,400
of just creating accounts out in

68
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,760
applications as they're assigned to

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,319
users

70
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,400
but life cycle management is also the

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,599
reverse of that so

72
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,680
you know as a user maybe leaves the

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,840
company or changes roles

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
then octa's life cycle management will

75
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,959
also go and de-provision

76
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,840
access for those accounts assigned to

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,080
that

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
user uh so workflows falls under

79
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,800
lcm lifecycle management and it's a an

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,440
extra

81
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,080
tool as part of life cycle management to

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,480
do

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,519
user provisioning

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,400
so with uh lifestyle management you can

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,239
see here that uh is the you know

86
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,879
the usual uh story of joiner move at

87
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,760
lever

88
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,959
uh as a user starts with a company or or

89
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,159
changes roles

90
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,480
uh then uh you know octa will then go

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,920
and provision access

92
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,159
uh to uh certain applications at the

93
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,000
same time with life cycle management

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,360
octa will go out actually create

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
accounts out in those applications

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,239
as they're assigned to user to our user

97
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,159
and so that's a traditional lcm and

98
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,440
that's been around in octa

99
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,640
part about for quite some time now and

100
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,480
uh you know a lot of our users or our

101
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,239
customers are using

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,599
exactly that uh but

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,720
um it does

104
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
uh a lot of good stuff but not

105
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,080
everything uh

106
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,720
it um there may be some sort of extra

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,360
things

108
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,920
that need to be done uh as part of the

109
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,080
life cycle user provisioning

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,480
exercise that you don't get with a

111
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,560
standard provisioning interface

112
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,760
uh and you can see here that um you know

113
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,840
a couple of these things in red here

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,000
uh when a you know a user joins the

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,599
company maybe you want to set some

116
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,879
entitlements out there

117
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,480
in the application for the user that

118
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
that aren't available in the standard

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,440
provisioning interface

120
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,918
uh maybe you want to actually go and you

121
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,839
know if using something like box or

122
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,440
or something like that you might want to

123
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,960
go and actually set some folder

124
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
permissions and stuff like that so

125
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,479
these are additional things on top of

126
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,080
the normal provisioning

127
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,719
exercise

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,680
the way that you would have probably

129
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,600
solved a lot of these things in the past

130
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,880
is via scripts

131
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,160
because there wasn't anything off the

132
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,240
shelf that you could buy to do this so

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,759
you really had to get a developer

134
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
to write a script to go and do these

135
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,960
customized

136
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,919
user provisioning use cases uh really

137
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,919
corner cases really specific to each

138
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,800
business

139
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,320
uh and it's probably nothing off the

140
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,360
shelf you're going to buy that's going

141
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,840
to do

142
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,759
exactly what you want to do so the way

143
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,280
that it's been solved in

144
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,320
in the past is

145
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,600
you know to write scripts custom code to

146
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,680
do these certain things

147
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,360
but there's a lot of negatives that come

148
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,039
with writing custom code

149
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,680
and scripts

150
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,840
so at a high level this is just an

151
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,960
example of

152
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,759
of a workflow you can do with octa now

153
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,000
that

154
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,840
you previously probably couldn't have

155
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,240
done without writing some custom code in

156
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,320
the past

157
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,360
uh so uh user is designed salesforce in

158
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,840
octa

159
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,360
so that's the standard thing you know

160
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,039
you the actual the account is going to

161
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,199
create it out in salesforce for the user

162
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,560
that's part of the standard lifecycle

163
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,120
management but you might want to do more

164
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,360
than that

165
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,199
you might want to actually add the user

166
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,520
to the the sales team

167
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,360
you might want to assign a territory for

168
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
the user and you might want to go and

169
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,000
let

170
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,880
that sales channel know via slack or

171
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,400
teams

172
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,120
that you know sending a welcome message

173
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,840
to that user

174
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,520
okay so this is um a high level

175
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,479
uh approach or look at the workplace

176
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,919
i'll be going into a bit more detail

177
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:16,319
about

178
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,199
um you know a bit more substance to it

179
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:19,840
but

180
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,758
it's um it's a no-code environment

181
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,919
it comes with um pre-built connectors

182
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,479
uh custom flows um standard some

183
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,240
templates to start you off

184
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,520
and also you can obviously build your

185
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,360
own flows but you know having

186
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,680
we'll be having a closer look at that um

187
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,240
in a little while

188
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,880
uh and so the benefits of octa workflows

189
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,600
um

190
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,759
over the way you would have done these

191
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,199
use cases in the past

192
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,639
um obviously you can do it quicker uh so

193
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,240
it's a no code environment just drag and

194
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
drop you can create your workflow really

195
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,599
quickly really easy deploy it

196
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,800
run it um it's

197
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
really easy you don't need a developer

198
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,080
like a architect business analyst

199
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,840
could quite easily pick up

200
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,560
workflows and use it it's quite easy to

201
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,680
use

202
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,160
and obviously you know lower costs it's

203
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
um you're not going to have to maintain

204
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,680
those scripts and also there's a lot of

205
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,720
technical debt that goes with that

206
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
and here's a look at some of those pros

207
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,400
and cons

208
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,840
about the way you would have done it in

209
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,000
the past versus the way

210
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,479
you can now do it with doctor workflows

211
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,840
uh as i said you know

212
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,199
you've got custom code you need to

213
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,880
maintain that uh

214
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,319
chances are that the person that wrote

215
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,400
that custom code is probably left

216
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,039
maybe there's no documentation uh maybe

217
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,960
you don't know how to go and change it

218
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,360
uh maybe you've got no one that can do

219
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,080
that

220
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,360
so you're stuck uh and so

221
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
um you know there's a lot of negatives

222
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
that go with that with octa workflows

223
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
uh you know it's a graphical uh gui uh

224
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,360
easy to configure

225
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,039
easy to maintain you can actually export

226
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,800
your flow you can actually upload your

227
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,919
flow to a

228
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,000
you know source code repository like

229
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,599
github

230
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,800
a lot of reuse there and so

231
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,080
you know because it's so easy and

232
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,000
intuitive you know if whoever wrote the

233
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,199
flow leaves

234
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,639
it someone can easily come along and

235
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,560
pick it up and uh and modify it

236
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,120
if need be

237
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,039
okay so it's going to go into a couple

238
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,280
of use cases now just to

239
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,560
have a look at some of the things you

240
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,720
can do with workflows

241
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,279
this might sort of help you identify in

242
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,479
your business

243
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,479
some of the things that it may be good

244
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,479
for

245
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,679
a lot of our customers that using

246
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,279
workflows are continually coming up with

247
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,399
new uses

248
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,640
uh and um so anyway let's have a look at

249
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,240
a couple of use cases so firstly at a

250
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,120
high level

251
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,760
uh workforce identity so workforce is uh

252
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,360
employees

253
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,000
as opposed to external customers uh so

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,640
you know this is

255
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,240
um just some very high level sort of

256
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,279
uh areas where you know workflows can

257
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,080
can really

258
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,880
uh come into play uh you know identity

259
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,600
conflicts

260
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,399
you know a lot of our our customers

261
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,440
large customers

262
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,000
might have two users of the same name uh

263
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
what's going to happen when we go and

264
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,480
try and

265
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,800
you know create the second user and

266
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,959
workflows can can actually automate the

267
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,839
resolution of that take granular actions

268
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,360
doing on and off boarding

269
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,120
maybe when someone starts the company um

270
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,760
as well as um uh deploying and

271
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,040
provisioning all their application

272
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,880
access maybe you want to notify their

273
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,320
manager maybe you want to modify it

274
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,760
notify the employee

275
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,279
maybe you want to send a message

276
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,519
downstream to some disparate system that

277
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,399
that that

278
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,680
still has to be manually used

279
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
has to be manually added to that system

280
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,760
so uh you can connect up all of these

281
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,720
things

282
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,040
and automate the whole process when a

283
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,920
user you know

284
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,080
starts and also when a user leaves as

285
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,320
well

286
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,120
the other half of octo what octa does is

287
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,880
customer identity

288
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,440
so this is identity for external

289
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,000
customers

290
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,959
external users and in this case there's

291
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,959
a whole swag of things that

292
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,920
you know you might want to do this is

293
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,720
you know

294
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,800
about user consent storing user consent

295
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,959
in something like one trust

296
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,680
may be syncing to some crm system that

297
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,720
that

298
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,160
doesn't have a standard provisioning

299
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,680
interface uh you know streamlining the

300
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,720
registration process identity proofing

301
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
uh validating the email all of that sort

302
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,320
of stuff

303
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,560
can easily be done but with octa

304
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,119
workflows

305
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,040
okay so here's sort of a bit of a lower

306
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,519
level about you know what octa workflows

307
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,160
can can

308
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,200
can be used for uh so the first one is

309
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,240
you know user provisioning is a

310
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,760
salesforce so that's yeah

311
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
that's been around we've done that for a

312
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,040
long time second one you know

313
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,360
provisioning into box uh g suite it's

314
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
been around for some time

315
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,680
obviously deep provisioning as well but

316
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,959
you know these are some additional

317
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,560
things there that

318
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,440
you know you might want to do that isn't

319
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,160
available

320
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
with the standard interface so in this

321
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,200
case you know

322
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,399
you might want to transfer

323
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,200
uh the the folders that user had in box

324
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,480
to their manager

325
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,160
uh and you can do that obviously with

326
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,800
workflows where you couldn't previously

327
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,640
uh the next one you know you might want

328
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,240
to actually create a ticket in

329
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,760
say servicenow for some provisioning or

330
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,519
deep revisioning exercise

331
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,640
for that user now you can go and do that

332
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,200
with dr workflows

333
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,279
and then the bottom one there you know

334
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,680
as i said notification slack

335
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,130
teams email

336
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,519
[Music]

337
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,399
and all of that stuff can be easily

338
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,920
implemented with workflows

339
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,200
uh some uh let's go to the next one

340
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,959
okay yeah another one here

341
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,440
which um we have difficulty previously

342
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,480
be able to do

343
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,240
is provision guest users in in office

344
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,560
so so now with workflows our connector

345
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,440
into uh

346
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,399
into office um i can easily provision a

347
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,320
guest users and so this is also

348
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,680
something that can be used for both

349
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,920
internal identities uh workforce

350
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
and also customer identities maybe you

351
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,959
want your business partners to just

352
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,480
access some documents in

353
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,639
sharepoint for example why provision

354
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,639
them a full license to do that

355
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,680
when you know a guest license uh enables

356
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,120
them to do exactly that

357
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,320
and those that no office you've got five

358
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,800
guest licenses for every you know paid

359
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,519
license

360
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,360
and so you can obviously rationalize

361
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,639
your licensing cost

362
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,480
by leveraging that the guest user

363
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,639
accounts

364
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,160
yeah you want to create some groups um

365
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
put the user in groups and do all of

366
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,399
that processing um out in office for

367
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,200
example

368
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,680
uh so so now we can go and do that with

369
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,800
that with workflows

370
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
and i said yeah resolve identity

371
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
conflicts this is something that

372
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,959
octa previously had had issues with um

373
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,279
it's more

374
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,040
well there's other ways to solve it

375
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,639
which a bit more bit more difficult but

376
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,560
now we can automate the process

377
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,399
so you know if a new user comes along

378
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,800
you see here that michael bolton

379
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,639
uh if there's another michael bolton

380
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,399
that comes along we can then

381
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,639
use put some logic in the workflow to go

382
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,079
and uh re

383
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,200
re you know name or that user account um

384
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,639
so it's it's a

385
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,120
makes it unique and there's no duplicate

386
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,000
and so that you know it's

387
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
quite a simple thing but it's a issue

388
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
that our customers have had issues with

389
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,519
um

390
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,199
for some time

391
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,079
okay now moving on to external customer

392
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:52,800
identities

393
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,519
uh so not workforce external customers

394
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,320
you know i said

395
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,399
before i mentioned crm systems so you

396
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,079
know you use the registers

397
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,519
with octa by our registration widget

398
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,600
uh you might want to actually go and um

399
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,720
you know

400
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,600
put them in in dynamics um add user to a

401
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,760
group give them entitlements to certain

402
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,399
things

403
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,560
more like b2b as opposed to b2c um

404
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,720
identity proof of customer uh so you

405
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,000
know a user registers you might want to

406
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,399
identify

407
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,639
evident um which is uh we've got a

408
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,839
connector uh

409
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,519
now for evidence so you can actually

410
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,600
plug that directly into docked workflows

411
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,399
call out

412
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,079
validate the user's email address or

413
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,760
whatever you need to validate

414
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,600
and then obviously send a notification

415
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,040
via teams connector

416
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,839
for some follow-up there so these are

417
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,600
just sort of some of the sample use

418
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,440
cases that you can use doctor workflows

419
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,120
for

420
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,920
sync provision so this is additional

421
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,720
provisioning

422
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,320
that you you couldn't have done with the

423
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,240
standard interface

424
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,440
so you know user registers

425
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,199
the partner is you can check your list

426
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,800
by an api call out

427
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
um and based on that decision we can

428
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,399
then go and do some branching and do

429
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,199
something different

430
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,800
depending if they're on the list of

431
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,120
approved accounts or not

432
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,399
uh and then another one here is um uh

433
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,800
you know user consent uh one trust

434
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,199
shopify uh and we can integrate an

435
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,839
interface

436
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
uh with all of those applications as

437
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,240
well

438
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,800
uh streamlab operations uh so

439
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,079
for whatever reason you might want to

440
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,320
need to add the user's

441
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,480
email or or information to some sort of

442
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,360
spreadsheet

443
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,959
you might want to contact or message

444
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,399
some sort of internal

445
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,880
party of your company to let them know

446
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,800
about that user

447
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,839
do all sorts of stuff like that um

448
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,720
yeah any any uh call any api so our

449
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,759
workflows can actually

450
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,839
call any api endpoint so you can really

451
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,240
plug any other external system in

452
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,839
that we don't have a connector already

453
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,240
for

454
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,000
uh security management so this is

455
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,440
another another good one

456
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,279
where you might have had to do use some

457
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,880
sort of external system to do this

458
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,680
previously

459
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,199
now you can do it with doctor so you

460
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,480
know opt to identify some sort of

461
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,839
security event

462
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,519
uh and we're gonna you know create a

463
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,959
ticket we can actually clear the user's

464
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,600
sessions

465
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,399
um we can then notify the security team

466
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:12,880
uh

467
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
and the same the bottom one you know the

468
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,959
actual user themselves identifies by an

469
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,720
email that there's a security uh

470
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,639
breach happened maybe they've got a

471
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,399
passport reset email

472
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,440
they didn't actually reset their

473
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,000
password uh in that case we can automate

474
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,040
um you know the account um uh reset

475
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,880
uh notify the employee that their

476
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,399
password's now been reset they need to

477
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,360
reset it back

478
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,759
um and also notify the security team by

479
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,480
slack as well

480
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,279
and marketing you know when we want to

481
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,279
notif um send the user information to

482
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,560
something like marketo

483
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,480
you want to log the user's consent in

484
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,160
one trust

485
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,600
and obviously you know fine grain

486
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,279
provisioning into um

487
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,000
salesforce like register a lead assign

488
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,839
that lead to a territory notify that

489
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,120
territory that this new

490
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,279
customer has just registered so you can

491
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,399
do all sorts of stuff like that

492
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,119
so so that's some of the use cases so um

493
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,199
just to uh before i ran out of time

494
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,640
uh just a quick look at actual

495
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,359
environment itself uh as i said it's uh

496
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,880
it's a no code environment

497
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,760
uh it's um it's a simple drag and drop

498
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,439
very intuitive for a user to

499
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,559
to get the hang of uh and

500
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,280
um as i said we've got uh we've got

501
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,240
connectors got

502
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,599
uh conditional logic uh it's really

503
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,039
you know as those that know sort of a

504
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,200
workflow tool it sort of matches with

505
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,760
that

506
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,440
uh connectors yeah so we've got heaps of

507
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,120
them uh they're adding to them all the

508
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,919
time

509
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,039
uh and as i mentioned before that if

510
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,640
there is not a connector in there that

511
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,400
connects to the system you want we've

512
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,559
also got a generic one as well

513
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,880
uh where you know it can connect to any

514
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,160
web service endpoint

515
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,600
so you can really connect up anything

516
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
that can you know expose itself via the

517
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
internet

518
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,240
um it comes with workflow templates so

519
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,799
these are

520
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,000
uh pre-configured uh workflows that do

521
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,360
um certain use cases uh so uh

522
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,679
these are really good for a starting

523
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,840
point so if you're not too you know for

524
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,559
for more of the beginner you can take a

525
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,840
template it's going to create that

526
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,760
workflow that use case for you

527
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,000
all you need to do then is go and modify

528
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,840
it and adjust it to do

529
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,520
your specific use case so you can

530
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,200
probably find a template in there

531
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
that actually is sort of close to what

532
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,320
you want to do

533
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,080
and that's a good starting point and

534
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,679
using the templates this obviously shows

535
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,200
you the best practice on how to actually

536
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,240
create

537
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,480
and manipulate and do all that workflow

538
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,720
stuff

539
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,679
we have a connector builder uh now this

540
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,400
is um

541
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,559
soon to be released so this is taking

542
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,440
the the

543
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,880
the um one step further now to

544
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,360
uh if you if you don't want to expose

545
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,799
your

546
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,600
system via a web service endpoint which

547
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
previously that's how we we did it

548
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,480
you can actually build your own

549
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,280
connector so um so if your system has

550
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,240
some sort of uh

551
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,760
interface some sort of proprietary

552
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,679
interface uh then we can actually

553
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,760
um you can create your own connector and

554
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,799
use that in

555
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,600
in workflows across you know a number of

556
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,320
different flows

557
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,400
uh just to finish up

558
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,280
uh those that know octa know where we're

559
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,640
located or 100

560
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,840
cloud-based system uh we have three

561
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,880
uh hosting options we've got us-based

562
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,120
we've got eu-based and we've got apac

563
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,919
based

564
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,080
uh so so now we actually have workflows

565
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,679
available in apac

566
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,720
so those that uh have octa apac sell

567
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,520
already

568
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,320
we now have octa workflow uh workflows

569
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,360
which runs

570
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,240
in parallel side by side with with your

571
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,679
current octa tenant

572
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,919
so we actually have now one in um in the

573
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,840
apac data center

574
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,120
and just finally any further questions

575
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,360
about octa workflows or anything else to

576
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,440
do with octa

577
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
please come and see us at the booth i'll

578
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,360
be there for a while

579
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,080
and happy to take you know any questions

580
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,799
about

581
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,440
workflows or anything else that doctor

582
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,280
might be able to help you with

583

586
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,559
precision

587
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,799
i've come to expect from octa ladies and

588
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,320
