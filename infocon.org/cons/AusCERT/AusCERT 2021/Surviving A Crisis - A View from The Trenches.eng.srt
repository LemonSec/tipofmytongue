[Music]

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,679
all right

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,920
up next we have eric pinkton from

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,160
trustwave uh

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,000
he's going to be talking to us about

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,920
surviving a crisis a view from the

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,119
trenches

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,960
everyone give eric a warm round of

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,359
applause

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,199
thank you and thank you for coming it's

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,880
the weirdest room configuration i think

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,159
i've ever spoken in

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,600
and i'm looking at all the naughty kids

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,000
sitting in the back like i can't see

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,040
um so surviving a crisis future from the

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,559
trenches the idea

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,079
was to share some of the observations

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,120
and lessons

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,840
that i've learned from both attending

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,039
crises as a

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,520
as a consultant and prior to that as a

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,199
sort of network engineer in the telco

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,160
space

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,879
and also i've been doing an awful lot of

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,520
simulated crisis with organizations

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,760
uh and i thought it'd be fun to it's a

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,120
sort of fascinating subject i thought

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,559
it'd be fun to talk through some of the

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,119
things

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,640
i've seen and some of the things i've

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,439
learned along the way

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,479
so let's jump straight in so who am i

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,840
and why why am i here so uh most people

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,439
that i know call me pinky

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,400
uh next week i'll have done uh 48 trips

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,600
around the sun

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,680
uh i counted that in that time starting

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,040
from about the age of 14

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
doing sort of casual work i've worked

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,600
for 24 different organizations

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,880
so obviously can't really hold down the

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,640
job for very long

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,799
i've got zero degrees i've never managed

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,040
to get a academic education i did a hnb

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,439
in media technology

46
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,920
i reckon i've got about a one to one

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
point four kill death ratio and what i

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,799
mean by that is

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,799
i think that now as a consultant i've

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,560
actually alleviated

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,640
more issues than i've actually caused

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,159
back in the time when i worked in

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,720
in telco so now i feel you know quite

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,320
quite safe talking about the stuff

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,880
because i'm

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,360
i think i'm more of a solution than i am

57
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,280
a cause of these these things

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,799
i think i've probably spent hundreds of

59
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,079
hours in in on calls or in rooms or

60
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,920
talking about sort of these types of

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,318
things and this is my fifth also

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,920
talk so those that have been before will

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,400
will know what they're in for

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
so what i'm going to talk to today so

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,319
defining i'm going to talk about

66
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,720
what define what is a crisis what

67
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,480
constitutes a crisis

68
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,640
refining how do we get good at managing

69
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,160
a crisis

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,680
the timing so i'll talk about the life

71
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
cycle of a crisis as i see it

72
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,080
revising so how to simulate a crisis or

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,640
what what

74
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,160
is the point and how to go about

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,720
simulating a crisis the findings

76
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,000
uh what i've observed on on my journey

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,080
uh inspiring so some recommendations or

78
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,280
some life hacks that i've

79
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,160
i've seen employed and then if we have

80
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,640
time

81
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,560
uh maligning so we'll have some sean and

82
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
freuda talking about some of the high

83
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,160
profile crisis that

84
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,000
that i've seen or that we've seen in

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,440
australia

86
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,640
um so try it and relax

87
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,360
and enjoy the crisis this is a quote by

88
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
a cartoonist called ashley brilliant

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,000
and i like it because not christ not

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,120
because crisis

91
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,800
are sort of fun in any way but they are

92
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,319
um a opportunity to uh

93
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,720
develop and and you know both on a

94
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,560
personal and an organizational level so

95
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,680
on a personal level

96
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
you can be the person in the room when

97
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,360
you need you know come with the outcome

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,159
of the man

99
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,280
and that is quite quite a rewarding

100
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,319
thing

101
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,760
so if you prepare and if you get good at

102
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,920
this stuff you you know it is a good

103
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,720
feeling to be

104
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,879
a help and and to be alleviating that

105
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,799
issue rather than compounding it

106
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,400
and on an organizational level there are

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
plenty of cases where organizations have

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,400
come

109
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,519
out of a crisis in pretty good shape

110
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,519
um often by virtue of the fact that

111
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,120
they've handled that corrosive crisis

112
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,959
really well and then that that

113
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,599
sort of buys them a bit more respect in

114
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,200
in

115
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,040
in the market or in the in the view of

116
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,480
the public

117
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,159
i did a talk a few years back on

118
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,519
reputational damage

119
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,280
and i talked about how ashley madison at

120
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,439
that time was doing better than ever

121
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,720
what what you know so from an

122
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,239
organizational perspective that was a

123
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,599
really good thing for them in terms of

124
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,439
publicity from a personal perspective

125
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,319
the people at the hell in that

126
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,239
organization didn't fare so well so you

127
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,000
have to have that in mind when i talk

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,799
about this

129
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,399
so if you do well you come out this

130
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,238
really well smelling roses

131
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,759
if you compound it and make it worse

132
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,279
then it will come back and bite you in

133
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,960
the bun

134
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
so what is a crisis so if you look it up

135
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,240
in the oed it says a time of intense

136
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
difficulty or danger which is completely

137
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,440
unhelpful really

138
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
we're at cyber security conference so

139
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,600
i'm talking about cyber security crisis

140
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,040
and really i'm talking about the sort of

141
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,360
black swan events the real

142
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,880
let's get everyone in the room and nut

143
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,560
out what we need to do this is you know

144
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,400
i'm not talking about

145
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,479
p1 issues or business as usual things

146
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,320
i'm talking about the really spectacular

147
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,360
things that happen

148
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,120
and really that is defined by your

149
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,400
organization so

150
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,880
mature organizations often fall back on

151
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,560
their sort of five by five matrix or

152
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,040
their

153
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,759
risk treatment plan and they will

154
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,280
declare a crisis when

155
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,199
you know perhaps a catastrophic event is

156
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,639
declared

157
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,360
um what you want is the ability to

158
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,840
trigger

159
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,320
that crisis management plan assuming you

160
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,600
get to the point where you actually have

161
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,440
a formal plan in place

162
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,240
at a consistent point you don't want to

163
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,320
rely on jerry on the help desk having a

164
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,160
funny feeling about this and that's the

165
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,759
trigger that gets this happening

166
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,360
because if jerry isn't working on that

167
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,199
particular day someone else might look

168
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,520
at it

169
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
more subjectively so so really what what

170
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,800
you want to do

171
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,039
is try to nail down the point at which

172
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,080
everyone has to be

173
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,919
convened i'm talking about your sort of

174
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,080
crisis management team

175
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,440
and you want that to happen um as soon

176
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,320
as as

177
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,800
it's sort of possible to to say you know

178
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,160
this is a serious thing

179
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
but not so often that everyone gets

180
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,919
fatigued and jaded by the fact they're

181
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,600
getting constant phone calls at two am

182
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,000
on a

183
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
on a sort of friday friday night

184
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,120
saturday morning what have you

185
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,199
um the other thing is that's interesting

186
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,280
about crisis is when we talk about cyber

187
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,960
security

188
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,520
if you talk about for instance i if you

189
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,319
worked for

190
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,000
a major retailer and a store burned down

191
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
um that might be a crisis and they would

192
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,840
then go around

193
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,280
calculating what the cost of that to the

194
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,960
business and it's very tangible

195
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,280
very visible things whereas when we talk

196
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,240
about cyber crisis

197
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,400
we're talking about ransomware it's far

198
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
more opaque to the people at the top of

199
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,600
that business exactly what

200
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,840
happens and what it means and you can't

201
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,280
quickly say well what was the value of

202
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
the stock in that store what is this

203
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,000
going to cost us

204
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,120
because we're dealing with very

205
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,759
intangible things like lost opportunity

206
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,800
cost or

207
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,199
churn of customers or so we don't have

208
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,280
good data and good modeling with which

209
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,479
to predict this so there's an

210
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,360
awful lot of thing you know decisions

211
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,080
being made

212
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,120
based on incomplete sort of data sets

213
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,319
and stuff which is why i think it's

214
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,360
quite fascinating

215
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,840
we're getting good at crisis management

216
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,680
so crises are going to appear

217
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,360
during your life it's a it's a fact of

218
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,960
life you may be lucky

219
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,400
and find that they're very low in

220
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,560
frequency or you might be

221
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,400
the the complete opposite you might even

222
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,240
have decided or decide to

223
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,400
turn your kind of life towards the the

224
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,840
direction where the action

225
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,759
is you know if you're a soldier or a

226
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,680
fireman or you're a paramedic

227
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
you will expect to encounter far more

228
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,360
crisis than somebody who perhaps works

229
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,479
in a library

230
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,000
although that isn't to say someone who

231
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,599
works in a library library might

232
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,639
consider

233
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,160
the intern coming in and sorting all the

234
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,199
books by color as a crisis

235
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,400
um so if we know that crises are

236
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,199
inevitable

237
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,720
the question is how do we get good at

238
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,240
this stuff

239
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,919
and i think there's three kind of things

240
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,599
that contribute to this

241
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,720
i call it nature nurture and sutra so

242
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,440
nature is those people who are just born

243
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,759
cool as a cucumber

244
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,240
there's often that person in a in a team

245
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,520
who just

246
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,400
you know absolutely cool and zen in in

247
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,800
when

248
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
you know everyone else is headed being

249
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,479
lost and they're keeping it calm

250
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,280
so you can be born that person the next

251
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,560
thing is you can

252
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,960
expose yourself to lots of those things

253
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,879
in the same way that you would expect a

254
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,960
first responder or somebody who worked

255
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,440
in a

256
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,599
e to get much better at dealing with

257
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,120
those crisises that are coming through

258
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,080
the front door

259
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,440
uh you know after they've been doing it

260
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,800
for a few years then they would be in

261
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,199
there

262
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,039
in their first shift so exposing

263
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,800
yourself to those those situations will

264
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
get you good at it

265
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,680
and suture um is is that kind of getting

266
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,039
those battle scars

267
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
you know as ramy said scars are where

268
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,759
the light enters your body so putting

269
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,120
yourself in this position where you're

270
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,879
going to experience lots of crisis

271
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,479
i'm very lucky as a consultant because i

272
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,399
get sort of the door gets opened and i

273
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,000
get kicked in through the door

274
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,519
go and go and help these guys out this

275
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,519
has happened so so i get exposed to it a

276
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,599
lot and i think i'm i'm

277
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,240
quite quite confident and competent in

278
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,039
those situations

279
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,480
through that exposure so poor que no los

280
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,880
tres why not try all three if you can if

281
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,000
you want to get good at this

282
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,399
um you can't control the way you were

283
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,760
born or your personality type but you

284
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,000
can

285
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
expose yourself to it and you can go and

286
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,040
read as much as you can about other

287
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,480
things and learn from other people's

288
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,959
mistakes

289
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,360
so let's talk about crisis life cycle

290
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,959
this is noah

291
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,640
i've used him a lot because he's part of

292
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,720
the microsoft powerpoint

293
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,600
clip art and he's free to use so i've

294
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,279
become quite obsessed with noah

295
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,600
i'll talk a bit more about him so before

296
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,480
the crisis

297
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,360
well i'm using the the suez as a nice

298
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,279
backdrop

299
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,640
then we've got during the crisis

300
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,279
and and then we've got well there's

301
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,720
during the crisis and then we've got

302
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
after the crisis this is particularly

303
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,839
interesting

304
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,760
because at the point when that evergreen

305
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,959
ship sailed on

306
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,600
down to a place in the suez canal called

307
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,160
the

308
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,399
great bitter lake for inspection

309
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,160
everyone assumed that the crisis was

310
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,200
over

311
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,519
when in fact the crisis was only just

312
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,480
beginning for

313
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,720
the you know the owners of the ship and

314
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,560
the cargo on board

315
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,040
um because it was then impounded by the

316
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,240
egyptian government

317
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,800
along with all the cargo and there's

318
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,160
this maritime

319
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,800
law um i think it's called made um

320
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,480
what's it called it's called

321
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,399
a general average and what that means is

322
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,399
that if you own the cargo in a

323
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,440
particular ship

324
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
you then have to contribute to the cost

325
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,680
of recovering the vessel during a

326
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,000
you know major calamity but that only

327
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,920
clicks in at the point when the cargo is

328
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
delivered to the

329
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,240
to the destination which was rotterdam

330
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,320
and because the ship has been impounded

331
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
and the egyptian government are trying

332
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,959
to sue

333
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,200
the ship owners for a billion dollars

334
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,519
for you know reputational damage and all

335
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,800
sorts of bizarre thing and their

336
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,079
insurers are saying it's absolutely

337
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:32,959
ridiculous

338
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,880
there's also another ship in the in the

339
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,399
source canal that's been there for five

340
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:36,959
years

341
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,720
and the crew are effectively trapped on

342
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,640
board because of the legal wrangling

343
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,680
over who pays for

344
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,200
recovery and so on so it's a good

345
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,959
there's a good chance the crew remaining

346
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,320
on that ship will be stuck on there for

347
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,120
years

348
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,800
and the owners of the cargo will never

349
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
see the cargo and will still be billed

350
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,240
and counter suing

351
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
and if you think about how complex that

352
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,079
is given the number of containers on

353
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:56,800
that ship

354
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,079
and then you think about how complex

355
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,959
the concept of ownership of stuff is in

356
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:03,920
in the shipping

357
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,240
world in terms of flags of convenience

358
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,279
and so on so forth

359
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,680
that is one unholy crisis that will go

360
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,640
on for years and years

361
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,160
so don't assume that just because it

362
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,920
sailed off the side of my slide that

363
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,959
it's all over

364
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,720
um yeah i digress let's break this down

365
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,839
before a crisis um this is

366
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,399
the kind of special stage because i'm

367
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,000
assuming because you're all in this room

368
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
now you're not in the middle of a crisis

369
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
it's a good opportunity to check your

370
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,640
phones in case something's happened and

371
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,279
you need to

372
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,399
you run out um

373
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,720
the this is where you get to prepare for

374
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,360
the crisis

375
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,800
this is kind of constant the other thing

376
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,519
this

377
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,959
phase actually covers during and after a

378
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,800
crisis because at any time during a

379
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,200
crisis another crisis could happen

380
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,440
and quite often crisis has spawn other

381
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,240
crisis

382
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,920
so so we're always in this before a

383
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,519
crisis so we should always be

384
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,399
preparing um so the first thing you need

385
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,399
to do is assemble your team as best you

386
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,000
can in an organization

387
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,480
and those are you know that the people

388
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,639
in that organization that are that can

389
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,560
make decisions they usually the the

390
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,079
crisis management team is usually the

391
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,760
very top execs

392
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,279
then you nominate various subject matter

393
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,959
subject matter expertise so you might

394
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,399
have someone who's on hand to provide

395
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,600
legal advice

396
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,279
you'll have the if you're the infosec

397
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,560
person you'll always get dragged in

398
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,079
there if it's a cyber crisis

399
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,600
the it people the hr people so you have

400
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,079
all those

401
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,519
those members and getting those people

402
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,399
um assembled having all their numbers to

403
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,360
hand

404
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,000
having a plan and have them know what to

405
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,360
do is absolutely

406
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
critical the next thing is selecting

407
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
your partners so if you're going to be

408
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,639
able to engage

409
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,360
an incident response or forensic partner

410
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,560
if you're going to

411
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,000
engage external legal counsel you're far

412
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
better getting those ducks in a row

413
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,200
before you need to

414
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,880
because what you will find is when you

415
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,200
phone an incident response company or a

416
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,160
or a lawyer at 6 pm on a friday which

417
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,320
will always be when this stuff happens

418
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,839
and start trying to negotiate

419
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,760
commercials and rates and sign

420
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,560
ndas you will lose hours if not days of

421
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,320
time and it will cost you a fortune

422
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,120
so if you can have instant response

423
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
retainers if you can have agreements if

424
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,000
you can sign all those

425
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,160
ndas and get all of that minutiae done

426
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,040
before the fact

427
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,440
you will save yourself a heap of time

428
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,000
and your chance of responding well

429
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,560
greatly increased the next thing is

430
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,200
developing your plan so having some some

431
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,920
usable crisis management plans sometimes

432
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,839
in organizations it's it's a virtue of

433
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,680
their business continuity plan sometimes

434
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,120
they have a special crisis management

435
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,519
plan

436
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,040
whatever works for you have a plan

437
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,760
smoke test it have people review it

438
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,880
revisit it

439
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,199
make sure it isn't 600 pages because in

440
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,680
a crisis situation nobody is going to

441
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,160
sort of you know leaf through something

442
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,680
that looks like a phone book it needs to

443
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,160
be succinct

444
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,240
it's good to have that available offline

445
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,480
so rather than storing it in your

446
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,079
sharepoint that's about to be taken

447
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,920
offline by ransomware and then you find

448
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,440
you can't access the crisis management

449
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:09,920
plan

450
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,079
so so having that backup is pretty

451
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,199
important

452
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,120
drilling i'll talk a little bit more but

453
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
that's going through and simulating this

454
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,279
to see if the plan works when when you

455
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,800
expose it to various crisis scenarios

456
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,639
and then off the back of that is taking

457
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,959
those lessons and refining those plans

458
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,959
and tweaking that and that's what what

459
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,320
i'm going to talk about a little bit

460
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,399
more and then rinse and repeat so keep

461
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,519
doing that

462
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,360
on a regular basis during a crisis

463
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,639
so i think a crisis falls into four

464
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,760
phases nk ykk

465
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,519
ek i remember it as new york is a

466
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,040
terrible english so

467
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,519
phase one no one knows so crisis has

468
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,120
happened something terrible has happened

469
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,000
but nobody knows so everyone is happy

470
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,839
and that is if you think about let's say

471
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,480
solar winds the attackers knew but it

472
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,639
was 2018 they started

473
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,639
putting that malware in the you know in

474
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,000
those software updates and everyone's

475
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,199
merely applying the updates

476
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,959
nobody knows that a crisis is taking

477
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,800
place then

478
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,360
you know something happens and you find

479
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,199
out and that's when everything changes

480
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,000
you get your team you assemble things

481
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,680
and you start running through your plan

482
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,199
and actioning it that's usually

483
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,720
that's where the interesting stuff

484
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,240
starts to happen

485
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,560
number three is they know that is where

486
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,480
you have to go and talk to the people

487
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,279
affected

488
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,720
or your partners or a wider circle

489
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,880
and that is where you're trying to avoid

490
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,079
step four which is

491
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,759
everybody knows so now you have

492
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,360
journalists phoning you for comment and

493
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,839
that

494
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,839
and and through these different phases

495
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,040
of a crisis

496
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,800
there are different ways to handle those

497
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,720
things

498
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,399
finally we get to the end of the crisis

499
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,839
as the evergreen sails off

500
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,120
into the the sunset um having

501
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,279
the a documented position on when a

502
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,320
client a crisis

503
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,399
is declared over is interesting because

504
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,920
i've been in crisis situations

505
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,519
that have dragged on for weeks and weeks

506
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,199
because nobody has wanted to make the

507
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:01,759
call

508
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,680
that this is over and it's actually

509
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
proved very costly for the organization

510
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,880
to have people

511
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,360
sitting around not just financially but

512
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,160
in terms of

513
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,240
you know having very very senior people

514
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
within an organization constantly

515
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,440
checking in on meetings

516
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,880
means that they can't go and do what

517
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,560
they normally would be doing

518
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,160
and they're very senior executive people

519
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,839
that tend to be very busy people so if

520
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,519
you take them off that it has an impact

521
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,600
on your organization

522
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
so what what point and what is the plan

523
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,440
to take that from the crisis

524
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,519
situation into a more business as usual

525
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,839
management

526
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,360
um after a crisis breaks down into the

527
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,040
sort of decompression period so if

528
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,639
you've been locked in a

529
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,480
very intense situation you've been in a

530
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,720
war room often you need to sort of

531
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,120
relax and and just get your your breath

532
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,399
back almost and

533
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,639
you know sometimes it's a case of going

534
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,000
down the pub and and

535
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
nutting it out over a few beers or it's

536
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,240
a case of giving people to go and relax

537
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,320
the next part inevitably happens is is

538
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,680
the blame game so this is when the

539
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,120
fingerboards are pointing and people

540
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,800
start to apportion blame for these types

541
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,959
of things then you might have a more

542
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,959
formal postmortem the met the blame game

543
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,799
typically happens before the postmortem

544
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,559
so people will speculate before you have

545
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,520
a position on

546
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,679
exactly what went wrong and then the

547
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,079
final piece which is i think the most

548
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,160
commonly overlooked piece is what i call

549
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,919
executing on lessons learned

550
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,000
so if you go to the trouble and you

551
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,760
absolutely should of doing that

552
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,359
lessons learned or that post-mortem

553
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,079
exercise and having findings and having

554
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,280
recommendations

555
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,559
make damn sure that those

556
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,559
recommendations get followed

557
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,919
through that they're apportioned to

558
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,919
someone otherwise you will find yourself

559
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,360
having deja vu

560
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,120
and you will find yourself in a meeting

561
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,039
going hang on a minute this happened

562
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,760
before

563
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,120
i'm sure we should have solved this

564
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,200
problem but nobody went through and

565
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,559
followed through or nobody checked that

566
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,039
it was done

567
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,600
so crisis simulation we're talking about

568
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,320
drilling the drilling those plans

569
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,120
um i think you know i love running

570
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,160
crisis simulation

571
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,320
it's a very in terms of effort and

572
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,440
expense it's a very

573
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,400
cheap exercise to do um it's usually for

574
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,000
us it's probably about two or three days

575
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,480
effort

576
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,640
all up that includes sort of a half day

577
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,520
actual

578
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,080
crisis simulation you get the people in

579
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,039
the room we present a a

580
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,039
scenario that typically is something

581
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,880
diabolical happening and it just gets

582
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,240
worse and worse and worse i'm

583
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,080
particularly fond of using ransomware

584
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,760
because it's very topical

585
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,960
everybody kind of gets it and it touches

586
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,360
on

587
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,200
everything in an organization so

588
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,840
ransomware talk gets into the financial

589
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,799
the security the i.t the logistics the

590
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,280
legal

591
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,160
implications of paying a ransom and

592
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,440
actually

593
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,160
reinforcing the idea in a business that

594
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,000
usually goes into that room expecting

595
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,080
that this is a cyber crisis it's a side

596
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,720
but

597
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,240
you know i can just point to the cyber

598
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,840
guy and say okay you run with it i'm

599
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,080
gonna i'm gonna sit back and watch

600
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,160
and straight away it goes out of the

601
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,120
cyber teams

602
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,679
pay grade and we're talking about the

603
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,520
logistics of buying a massive amount of

604
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,640
bitcoin or the

605
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,960
legal implications of paying a

606
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,080
sanctioned

607
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
team in eastern europe or so on and so

608
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,360
forth

609
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,440
so uh this the critical things if you're

610
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,960
going to do simulation

611
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,799
is to involve the actual crisis

612
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,080
management team

613
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,160
and that is to say that typically when

614
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,919
you as a cyber security person say hey

615
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,360
we should we should

616
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,120
drill the cyber security plan the

617
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,640
business will say that's a great idea

618
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,000
why don't you get all your team in a

619
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,400
room

620
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,080
and do some war games and let this out

621
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,919
and it's hard to get the business in

622
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,600
that room to do that because they think

623
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,960
they're too important or they think that

624
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,799
this is perhaps this is a cyber issue

625
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,440
it's for you so sometimes that's a slow

626
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,720
process of getting them

627
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,760
involved the scenario that you use has

628
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,799
to be relevant

629
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,520
and it has to be plausible otherwise you

630
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,960
waste an awful lot of time in the

631
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,080
organization

632
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,679
fencing with people who say well that

633
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,280
could never happen in our organization

634
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,520
and it breaks the flow of the exercise

635
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,280
so it has to be something that that

636
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,799
grabs people's attention

637
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,679
and seems like it could happen next

638
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,280
thing i think is giving people a

639
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,120
sporting chance i've seen people run

640
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,240
exercises and

641
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,600
absolutely you know go nuclear

642
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,760
with the scenario such that people end

643
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,400
up with post-traumatic stress or end up

644
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,080
just being becoming

645
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,480
completely fatalistic if that's happened

646
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,880
then my reaction is probably to jump on

647
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,400
seek and look for another job because

648
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:20,799
it's

649
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,320
completely catastrophic

650
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,360
pressure testing extant resources so

651
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,120
going through what i mean by that is if

652
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,480
you've got these resources which might

653
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,080
be

654
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,320
incident response teams or might be your

655
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,760
third party council

656
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,880
it might be your backup strategy or it

657
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,320
might be your it team

658
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,880
as you go through that that scenario and

659
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,080
you start to say well we're going to

660
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,760
call these guys we're going to

661
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,360
deploy this team we're going to do that

662
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,080
thing is go is walk through those things

663
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,840
and find out whether they would actually

664
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,320
work if you were doing it for real

665
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,080
because what you sometimes find is even

666
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,440
though you have an instant response

667
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,200
retainer in place

668
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,600
when you phone up your ir people and say

669
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,440
you know hypothetically speaking if we

670
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,720
were to need three guys

671
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,000
in sydney within the next you know 24

672
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,400
hours

673
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,080
could you do it and have an open and

674
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,440
honest conversation hopefully they'll be

675
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,320
honest with you

676
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,559
and a lesson learned might be we need

677
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,000
some more partners

678
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,280
um to as a fallback if they're unable to

679
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,720
field those

680
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,640
um it has to be tailored for your

681
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,400
organization so i've seen

682
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,679
exercises run that were kind of a

683
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,520
theoretical company and you're assigned

684
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,280
a theoretical role in that company

685
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,360
and they are good for exposing people to

686
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,280
the concept of a crisis and

687
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,600
getting them comfortable with the idea

688
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,440
but it doesn't get them thinking about

689
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,280
what would happen in their organization

690
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,480
and it doesn't test

691
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,679
your your current plans and the final

692
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,720
bit is

693
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,559
building the lessons learned process or

694
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,080
that postmortem process

695
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,799
into the process of running that crisis

696
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,960
so you actually test

697
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,360
um and look at how the crisis went and

698
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,280
what those lessons were and execute on

699
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,399
those things that you find

700
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,919
pinky's observations so these are the

701
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:06,960
things that i've seen

702
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,799
uh from from doing this a whole bunch of

703
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,440
times so almost every organization

704
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,919
has that could do better or

705
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,520
opportunities for improvement in their

706
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,039
preparation

707
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,159
so it's rare to see organizations have a

708
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,440
go-to out-of-band communication platform

709
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,600
set up so that can be as easy as having

710
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,440
a whatsapp group with all the com

711
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,559
the team in it um there are some more

712
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,400
cool technical solutions like whisper

713
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,880
which

714
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,159
blast style sms is or gets everyone on

715
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,480
on a call and why that's important is

716
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,919
because i've worked with organizations

717
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,679
where they've had reason to

718
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,320
suspect or to question the integrity of

719
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,679
the communication platforms they're

720
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,520
using because they've got a

721
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,880
you know the hypothesis is there's

722
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,360
a state-based actor active within their

723
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,320
exchange

724
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,640
and they can't email people and be

725
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,760
confident that the

726
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,559
the attacker that they're basically

727
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,400
trying to evict from the network is

728
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,919
across their communications so being

729
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,600
able to jump into whatsapp

730
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,440
just to set up something else or some

731
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,200
other way hey i need everyone to

732
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,880
register a gmail account so we can

733
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,120
actually coordinate this eviction

734
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,640
without the attackers knowing what we're

735
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,960
up to having an incident response

736
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,559
retainer

737
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,520
nine times out of ten if you phone up a

738
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,000
incident

739
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,480
response company and say hey we'd like

740
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,000
to set up a retainer

741
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,720
uh and we'd like to go now it's a bit

742
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,760
like phoning up a

743
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,200
remove list and saying hey i'd like to

744
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,720
move house and they're like yeah when

745
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,159
can i schedule in

746
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,720
in about 20 minutes you get you they're

747
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,240
just going to laugh at you

748
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,679
so so have an ir retainer with a

749
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,159
you know a reputable organization have

750
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,200
fallbacks

751
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
so that you can phone them and get them

752
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,120
as quickly when you need them as quickly

753
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,159
as you can likewise

754
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,279
with legal counsel having insurance

755
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,080
cover

756
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,760
and knowing what your insurance covers

757
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,520
and knowing what that what those details

758
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,720
are

759
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,279
and i did have got an interesting kind

760
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,640
of war story which was working with an

761
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,799
organization that got ransomwared

762
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,720
and they were having some dialogue with

763
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,799
the attackers over the dark web

764
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,400
and the attackers basically said they

765
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,919
said we can't possibly afford to pay

766
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,279
this ransom

767
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,640
the attacker said yes you can you can

768
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
just claim it on your insurance and they

769
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,320
said no no we're not insured

770
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,840
for that for this our insurance won't

771
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,679
cover this and they said yes yes

772
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,400
we will trust us they said no no we're

773
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,520
pretty sure that our insurance doesn't

774
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,320
cover us for this

775
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,840
so the attacker sent the copy of the

776
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,200
insurance certificate that they'd

777
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,039
exfiltrated from the organization

778
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,640
with highlighter kind of saying yes

779
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,320
you're covered don't worry and i've

780
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,600
since heard that that one of the

781
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
strategies that the ransomware gangs

782
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,640
have used is attacking the insurance

783
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
companies to steal lists of companies

784
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,159
that they know are insured and then one

785
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,360
by one they attack the companies that

786
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,720
are insured and at the end of it they

787
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,880
attack the insurance company

788
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,279
so they're pretty they're pretty wily um

789
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,200
people who can't find the plans or the

790
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,799
plans are online they can't get to them

791
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,559
very commonly do a crisis scenario

792
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,120
they'll go through the entire scenario

793
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,480
and they will do the whole thing

794
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,520
ad hoc on the fly and then you'll say at

795
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,080
the end of it

796
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,960
did anyone consult the crisis management

797
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,400
plan that we're here to test

798
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,919
oh we've got a crisis management plan

799
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,000
nobody told me about that you know or oh

800
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,200
yeah we couldn't find it

801
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,600
so make sure that you you if you've gone

802
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,000
to the trouble of creating a plan

803
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,679
that you that people know about it and

804
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,960
they can find it so if you're going to

805
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,919
run a crisis

806
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,000
it's kind of courteous to to give people

807
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,039
in the lead up to that

808
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,919
a few hints about where it is because

809
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,440
that means at the end of the crisis you

810
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,720
can then

811
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,400
say well actually we didn't have

812
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,000
anything in the crisis management plan

813
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,559
about this particular thing

814
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,760
uh and then the confusion about where

815
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,240
bcp and dr and crisis management

816
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,840
kind of kicks off is quite quite common

817
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,000
next thing is too many or too few people

818
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
in the room so

819
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,000
sometimes organizations are want to get

820
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,360
a very small

821
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,960
core of people and it's a very

822
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
authoritarian

823
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,279
we're going to make all the decisions um

824
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,559
and they tend to

825
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,200
make knee-jerk reactions or they make

826
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,640
decisions without

827
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
having the information they really need

828
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,159
to make those decisions

829
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,480
the alternative is getting far too many

830
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,080
people in the room so i've been in a war

831
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,200
room with over

832
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,919
50 people and it was just death by

833
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,679
committee and nothing happened

834
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,400
and at one point it was asked is there

835
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,159
anyone else on this

836
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,080
who should be on the call that he's not

837
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
on the call and there were six or seven

838
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,679
names that were thrown up

839
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,200
and then they said is there anyone on

840
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,480
this call that doesn't need to be on

841
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,159
this call can you leave the call and not

842
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,919
one single person dropped off the call

843
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,520
because everyone was in to see what

844
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,279
would happen so so

845
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,559
that was an absolute you know for my

846
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,080
view it was an absolute disaster in

847
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,799
their ability to handle that crisis

848
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,520
because it was just everyone had an

849
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,120
opinion about everything and it was

850
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,120
collecting and the poor scribes who were

851
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,480
charged with documenting what was

852
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,279
happening

853
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,000
were just absolutely overrun um

854
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,159
next thing absence of record keeping so

855
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,159
i i mentioned scribes there

856
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,240
so organizations unless they're very

857
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,200
disciplined

858
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,159
will not naturally start scribing what

859
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,520
is happening

860
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,320
and that is absolutely critical because

861
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,559
remember i talked about the blame game

862
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,279
is after every crisis there will be

863
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,279
questions asked why did that decision

864
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,480
get made

865
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,559
and in hindsight it's very easy to say

866
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,240
well that was the wrong decision

867
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,799
but at the time the decision was made if

868
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,640
you document the rationale for why that

869
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,240
decision you know what we knew

870
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,080
what we didn't know at that particular

871
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,679
time was this and that's why we all

872
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,960
agreed to do that

873
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,559
if that is recorded in black and white

874
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,200
then you are then your ass is covered to

875
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,080
use the vernacular

876
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
next thing analysis paralysis it's the

877
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,960
inability to make a decision

878
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,360
sometimes not doing anything is the

879
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,120
right thing to do

880
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,799
however that has to be a conscious

881
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,360
decision indecision absolutely kills in

882
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,200
a crisis and really what the crisis

883
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,440
boils down to is your ability to make

884
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,799
decisions without the full facts at your

885
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,840
disposal

886
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,320
at a cadence that that is right for the

887
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,679
situation it sounds very

888
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,640
very easy but if you if you and this is

889
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,760
what happens when you get too many

890
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,039
people in the room

891
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,360
and you just cannot do anything because

892
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,080
nobody oh let's all have a show of hands

893
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,320
you know it just slows things right down

894
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,679
and things can get

895
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,919
progressively worse very quickly in that

896
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,559
situation

897
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
knee-jerk reactions is the opposite to

898
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,960
that usually it's a consequence of

899
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,399
having an authoritarian kind of

900
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,760
organization with two feet

901
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,320
too few people in the room uh they go

902
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,880
and and i

903
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,880
alluded to this in my in my paper where

904
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,360
i did a crisis management

905
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,960
scenario with an organization and i

906
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,559
threw in a small denial of service

907
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,520
attack they're an

908
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,679
online retailer and the first decision

909
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,960
came from the ceo let's turn the

910
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,480
internet off

911
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,240
to so the result of denial of service

912
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,399
attack was let's turn the internet off

913
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,600
which i i still laugh hard about

914
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,240
and and i i sort of stood back and i

915
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,120
sort of

916
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,960
gestured towards the i.t guy to say do

917
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,320
you want to explain to the

918
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,840
ceo why that's a bad idea and the

919
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
the the dynamic there was that he just

920
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,640
wasn't able to convey in a language that

921
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,600
sia could understand

922
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,520
why that was really why i was almost

923
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,600
crippled in the corner laughing

924
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,399
so it happens

925
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,159
i can't hear you can you hear me so that

926
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,720
is really about the fact that now if a

927
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,840
crisis happens

928
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,000
you will be on zoom or somebody will be

929
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,120
on teams

930
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,480
and there will be someone on the call

931
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,159
who doesn't quite realize that they're

932
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,679
not on mute or there'll be someone on

933
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,799
the call who is on mute

934
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,039
doesn't realize they're on mute there

935
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,039
will be two people in a room somewhere

936
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,559
both dialed in and they'll be getting

937
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,720
feedback and they won't understand why

938
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,480
they'll be the person who dials in from

939
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,720
the car um who hasn't got a headset and

940
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,000
there'll be a massive amount of noise

941
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,679
and what that means is that

942
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,600
decisions aren't able to be made because

943
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,360
no one knows what's going on

944
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,279
the scribes job is made infinitely

945
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,480
harder so

946
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,640
actually building some of the common

947
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,399
courtesies about using

948
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,320
video conferencing into that crisis

949
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,640
management make sure people know how to

950
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,480
go on mute make sure they have

951
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,559
headphones and they know to use them

952
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,159
turning the cam on when you're talking

953
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,320
is i think a kind of basic

954
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,960
um courtesy there's a massive amount of

955
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,159
communication that non-verbal

956
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,120
communications happen

957
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,600
especially when in a crisis tempers can

958
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,840
get quite flared people can get quite

959
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,520
impassioned about things let's say i've

960
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,960
seen people reduce to tears and i've

961
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,480
seen people shouting

962
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,679
um if you're don't have your cam on and

963
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,159
you're

964
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,640
shouting at someone it can come off

965
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,399
sometimes as being far more aggressive

966
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:36,720
than

967
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,159
than it might be if you had to come on

968
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,919
it seems quite weird

969
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,960
but getting good we have to get good at

970
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,600
these kind of situations and and if

971
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,039
you're not drilling it and seeing how

972
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,720
this happens so a common lesson learned

973
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,360
is

974
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,760
you need to you can't rely on you know

975
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,279
your old-fashioned conference bridge you

976
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,360
should be using teams or zoom

977
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,919
get people used to using it use whatever

978
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,600
yeah people are okay with

979
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,279
it's surprising that at this time in

980
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,039
2021 some people are still

981
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,559
not okay with teams and zoom and what

982
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,279
have you but there we are

983
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,919
recommendations uh cover your ass

984
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,200
subscribe subscribe subscribe

985
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,640
so uh get people you know assign people

986
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,159
to write stuff down don't rely on one

987
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,519
person to have a couple of people so

988
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,559
that if they have

989
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,720
uh any contention about what was said or

990
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,240
what the decision was they can let it

991
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,640
out between themselves

992
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,240
don't fall into the trap of relying on

993
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,080
technology to do that scribing for you

994
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,039
there are some

995
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,039
iphone apps like otter that will

996
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,399
transpose it all

997
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,080
um it's worth doing it as a fallback to

998
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,600
the person doing the scribe so that they

999
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,000
can

1000
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,039
you know as an aide for them but

1001
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,440
that understand the implications of you

1002
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,080
know

1003
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,279
what is a very sensitive meeting ending

1004
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,799
up in somebody's private cloud

1005
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,240
where somebody's personal cloud sorry um

1006
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,640
and understand the the inadequacies of

1007
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,320
those voice to text when you've got

1008
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,840
10 people in a room or shouting at each

1009
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,600
other phone

1010
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,240
all the friends so have a list in your

1011
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,000
crisis management plan of salient

1012
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,440
context and by that i mean law

1013
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,519
enforcement i mean the acsc i mean your

1014
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,559
instant responders

1015
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,480
your legal people and don't be

1016
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,559
frightened to get them

1017
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,240
on the phone and consult them when they

1018
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,000
need to to be there

1019
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,559
and and then know when to hang up right

1020
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,120
don't

1021
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,559
just because you call in someone for

1022
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,159
some advice don't be

1023
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,919
frightened to say that's awesome we'll

1024
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,360
get back to you on that

1025
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,320
and because each person you call into

1026
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,960
the room

1027
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,559
especially if you're talking external

1028
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,640
consultants or external agencies

1029
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,440
will have a a bit of an agenda and i'll

1030
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,480
give you a good example

1031
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,080
is if you are ransomwared one of the

1032
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,399
really useful things to do is call the

1033
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,440
acsc they will have a massive amount of

1034
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,880
expertise that they can leverage they've

1035
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,640
got a massive amount of experience

1036
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,360
but they will push you very hard on the

1037
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,039
position of not paying the ransom

1038
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,559
because that is very much their agenda

1039
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,519
because that's what

1040
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,480
you know that's their raison d'etre and

1041
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,679
i have been in a room with an

1042
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,120
organization where

1043
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,200
this decision they faced was do we pay

1044
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,440
the ransom or do we go out of business

1045
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,679
and it's very hard to be glib and say

1046
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:10,799
well you shouldn't pay the ransom

1047
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,320
because you're just encouraging them

1048
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,799
because what you know for them as an

1049
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,519
organization

1050
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,159
they had to have to seriously consider

1051
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,600
paying that ransom

1052
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,919
and the acsc were very dogged in the way

1053
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,360
that they were kind of pushing them

1054
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:25,919
about

1055
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,360
you know not even having that

1056
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,919
conversation so being able to sort of

1057
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,919
hang up when you need to and and have

1058
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,120
that internal dialogue

1059
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,200
is important and then if you're going to

1060
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,000
phone people have those ndas in in place

1061
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,039
so you don't waste time um this is

1062
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,640
something i saw done

1063
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,080
once and it stuck with me so so um

1064
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,720
it's kind of like that buda loop um it

1065
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,200
was

1066
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,360
the discipline of having a whiteboard

1067
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,960
and breaking it down into what do we

1068
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,600
know

1069
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,919
what do we not know and what are our

1070
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,279
assumptions

1071
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,799
and what that did is it created a very

1072
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,640
sort of conceptual model for what was

1073
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,320
happening that was very clear to

1074
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,279
everyone

1075
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,200
and then they focused on taking the

1076
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,879
things they didn't know across

1077
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,199
into the stuff that they did know okay

1078
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,800
before we make that decision we

1079
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,560
really need to understand you know how

1080
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,839
big is this

1081
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,560
um when did it happen what's infected

1082
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,079
and blah blah blah so

1083
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,879
so that you know get a whiteboard make

1084
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:23,520
sure you've got

1085
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
the whiteboard and the pens still work

1086
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,879
someone hasn't stolen all the lids and

1087
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:27,918
you've just got

1088
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,599
you know 17 markers that have carefully

1089
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,879
been put back even though they don't

1090
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:31,839
work

1091
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,520
um but that was i a really effective

1092
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,079
and easy way that made a real difference

1093
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,280
in in that scenario

1094
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,800
and i've coached people on doing that

1095
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
again and it's always worked well

1096
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,359
uh indecision kills fast is better than

1097
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,560
perfect

1098
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,359
uh consistency is better than perfection

1099
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:49,839
um

1100
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,159
so you can't always make the perfect

1101
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,040
choice but if you

1102
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,239
if you have systems and uh

1103
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,560
you know similar to the um you know

1104
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,160
knowing at the point when that

1105
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,720
that crisis is declared and if that is a

1106
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,000
well understood

1107
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,079
model for some something of this

1108
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,839
magnitude has to be happened before we

1109
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,359
get everyone in that room

1110
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,960
if that's consistent it will be much

1111
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
better than again you're relying on

1112
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,240
jerry on the help desk

1113
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,720
having a funny feeling about this again

1114
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
uh looking after each other mentally and

1115
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,839
physically

1116
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,800
um any crisis situation even simulations

1117
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,599
can take their toll on people's mental

1118
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,240
sort of well-being and so keeping an eye

1119
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,079
out for each other understanding the

1120
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,760
toll that that takes

1121
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,079
and making sure people you know getting

1122
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,280
fed drinking water

1123
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,440
if they need lollies and getting them

1124
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,040
through that it's easy to overlook that

1125
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,480
especially in

1126
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,880
uh situations that are protracted so if

1127
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,800
people are stuck in a room for 12 hours

1128
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,400
and nobody's thought that oh let's go

1129
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,480
get some drinks or get some food

1130
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,240
it will start to affect the decisions

1131
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,000
that are being made

1132
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,640
um i say do not afraid to do not be

1133
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,320
afraid to use levity now

1134
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,680
where that comes from if you ever work

1135
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,000
with you know first responders or

1136
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,680
firemen they have this black sense of

1137
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,320
humor

1138
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,960
that is a almost a pressure valve that

1139
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,040
they use to deal with those situations

1140
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,839
and actually there's been moments in in

1141
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:10,720
you know real

1142
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,480
situations that i've been in where

1143
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,040
someone's made a dad joke or and it's

1144
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,000
completely broken the the pressure and

1145
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,880
the mood

1146
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,640
and it's got everyone it's just given

1147
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,240
people that chance to catch their breath

1148
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,520
and get onto it so don't be afraid to

1149
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,800
use levity yourself

1150
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,119
and don't if you're an organization and

1151
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,400
you're trying to build that culture

1152
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,200
around how to

1153
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,920
how to manage this situation don't set

1154
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,320
it up

1155
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,240
such that people are expected to be very

1156
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,680
stoic and and

1157
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,359
you know this is a serious matter and i

1158
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,640
need you you know i don't need you in

1159
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,920
the room if you're going to be flipping

1160
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,320
about this

1161
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,760
you know that that kind of attitude i

1162
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,599
don't think works well

1163
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,839
and the final thing is uh is a the kind

1164
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,680
of pilot's mantra which is aviate

1165
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,839
navigate communicate and administrate

1166
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,160
and that's the hierarchy of how you deal

1167
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,119
with a crisis

1168
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,839
in an aircraft which is usually a big

1169
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,119
thing

1170
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,119
is there have been and this came from an

1171
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,880
aircraft investigation where

1172
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,200
a couple of pilots saw a warning light

1173
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,720
and they were so

1174
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,200
um focused on figuring out what the

1175
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,960
warning light meant they flew into a

1176
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,400
mountain

1177
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,440
so it's the it's the and if you think

1178
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,800
about a crisis that spans

1179
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,040
a number of days it's very easy for that

1180
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,880
crisis management team to be completely

1181
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,720
focused on managing that crisis

1182
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,240
at the expense of everything else that's

1183
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,839
going on in the business and that can

1184
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,520
have a really a really detrimental

1185
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,240
effect

1186
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,839
so having that discipline to look up

1187
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,280
from the cockpit once in a while and see

1188
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,560
what's going on

1189
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,320
to think about where you're going and

1190
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,079
communicate with each other and then the

1191
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,119
last thing is that

1192
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,160
you know documentation piece

1193
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,839
uh other interesting things how are we

1194
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,240
doing for time

1195
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,800
uh other interesting things so there's a

1196
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,960
few laws that that i think come up again

1197
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,800
and again in this so financial's law

1198
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,960
is murphy's law on steroids so if

1199
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,800
anything can go wrong it will go wrong

1200
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,200
and at the worst possible time

1201
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,960
uh always always have that in the back

1202
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,680
of mind without with anything like this

1203
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,760
occam's razor that's william of ockerman

1204
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,680
in the picture

1205
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,680
facing us not with his back towards uh

1206
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,440
the simplest explanation is usually the

1207
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,079
right one

1208
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,839
very easy in a crisis scenario to get

1209
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,079
all quite fantastical about what this

1210
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:14,960
could be

1211
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,160
and diagnose an apt in china hacking us

1212
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,599
when in fact it's just somebody's

1213
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,160
forgotten

1214
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
you know somebody's tripped over a cable

1215
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,280
and

1216
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,560
so have the rigor to question what the

1217
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,200
most

1218
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,280
obvious explanation is and and give that

1219
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,599
some scrutiny first

1220
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,520
example of that in medical in medicine

1221
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,079
is is referred to as zebra

1222
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,160
and that loosely translated is when you

1223
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,760
when you hear hooves think of horses not

1224
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,520
zebras and it's just that

1225
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,640
think think what is the most likely

1226
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,760
outcome of what we're seeing

1227
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,079
hanlon's razer never attribute to malice

1228
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,680
that which is adequately explained by

1229
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,720
stupidity

1230
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,359
so this comes up a lot of the time when

1231
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:53,839
uh

1232
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,200
you know you'll be investigating an

1233
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,640
issue and you'll see a username and a

1234
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,000
log and you'll straight away everyone

1235
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,520
like oh we always knew that guy was

1236
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,280
untrustworthy let's go and let's go and

1237
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,560
get him in a headlock and make him

1238
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,000
confess and it's like he could have had

1239
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,640
his creds

1240
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,839
legitimately stolen or so so holding

1241
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:08,480
back on

1242
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,599
on on the pitchforks and the other thing

1243
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:11,920
is

1244
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,200
uh you know i talked about people

1245
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,800
getting quite fatalist if they go

1246
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,599
through these

1247
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,599
scenarios and they are completely

1248
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,720
diabolical

1249
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,480
and there's an american politician or

1250
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,079
american senator called cory booker and

1251
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:22,800
he said

1252
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,240
never let your inability to do

1253
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,839
everything undermine your determination

1254
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,839
to do something and that's always been

1255
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,440
my mantra in this

1256
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,680
cyber world in terms of how defeatist

1257
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,440
you can get about how hot it is

1258
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,480
so same in a crisis situation

1259
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,839
there how are we doing for the time

1260
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,760
okay all right so i i saved a few

1261
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,480
comedy case studies uh one of the the

1262
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,920
obvious ones to talk about was the

1263
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,119
census

1264
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,400
uh debacle or census fail in australia

1265
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,440
um 2016

1266
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,160
it went live there was a delilah service

1267
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,000
attack

1268
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,440
it resulted in ibm running around like

1269
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,640
headless chickens

1270
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,599
there was a 43 hour outage during the

1271
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,800
during the period you were supposed to

1272
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,240
do your census

1273
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,040
and there's a great report that you can

1274
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,560
go and read that was

1275
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,720
written as there's a url on the page

1276
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,240
i'll share these slices

1277
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,800
and what the report lessons learned were

1278
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,839
that ibm had

1279
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,359
mountains of playbook but they were

1280
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,040
completely untested and they were

1281
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,400
completely impractical

1282
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,760
in in when they used it the abs had no

1283
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,599
real incident response process

1284
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,359
and made did the whole thing kind of on

1285
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,920
the fly and ad hoc

1286
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,680
support mechanisms weren't linked to the

1287
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,160
process um so they didn't have

1288
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,960
the numbers that they could ring or or

1289
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,240
they couldn't you know they didn't have

1290
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,200
a process which was

1291
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,720
engaged this team which were ready in

1292
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,560
weight all dressed up and ready to go

1293
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,400
but were never engaged

1294
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,200
um escalation thresholds were not clear

1295
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,040
so the point at which somebody needed to

1296
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,640
call a minister or someone needed to

1297
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,839
give someone an update

1298
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,160
just absolutely was were lost in the fog

1299
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,680
of war

1300
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,520
the dos protections obviously were

1301
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,359
deemed inadequate

1302
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,000
and the dos attack itself was very very

1303
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,720
low volume

1304
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,160
should not have caused a problem had

1305
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,079
they had they been doing the right thing

1306
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,160
uh crisis communications were absolutely

1307
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,440
shocking they were very

1308
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,280
very uh after the fact they were very

1309
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,839
short and terse um ibm had employed a

1310
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:26,319
sub

1311
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,079
contractor which which they ended up

1312
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,119
throwing that trying to throw the

1313
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,880
subcontractor under the bus when malcolm

1314
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,040
threw ibm under the bus

1315
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,240
massive massive mess and if you think

1316
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,200
about this through

1317
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,720
the lens of what i'm talking today which

1318
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,400
is simulating a crisis

1319
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,200
had they done a tabletop exercise or a

1320
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,800
you know a

1321
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,520
crisis simulation of something like a

1322
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,040
denial of service attack

1323
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,720
many of those things could have been

1324
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,760
picked up before they were a problem

1325
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,359
the other great thing that somebody did

1326
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,119
is shouted let's turn it on and off

1327
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,720
again and they did and it turned out

1328
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,319
that the primary router hadn't been

1329
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,079
synced with a secondary router so by

1330
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,680
turning on and off they actually made it

1331
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,560
worse and

1332
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,640
that led to so it's quite interesting

1333
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,640
reading

1334
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,280
other things that were quite good so git

1335
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,000
lab

1336
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,440
back in 2017 they accidentally wiped

1337
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,040
both the primary and the secondary

1338
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,680
database and then realized that all

1339
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,800
five types of backups they were doing

1340
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,240
it were not working and the actual words

1341
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:26,960
in the document

1342
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,200
they published in their crisis comms you

1343
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,400
know

1344
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,560
you know what's the word um the sort of

1345
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,920
apology was

1346
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,079
so in other words to five backup

1347
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,079
replication techniques deployed

1348
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,400
none are working reliable or reliably or

1349
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,839
set up in the first place

1350
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,880
so a nice dr test or a bcp

1351
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,800
might have picked those things up very

1352
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,640
embarrassing for them

1353
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,520
uh and the final one is the what what is

1354
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,280
known within or was known in coca-cola

1355
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,040
as project kansas

1356
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,640
this is one of my favorite stories it's

1357
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,079
not cyber related

1358
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,560
i'll go through it very quickly so 1985

1359
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,480
coke was losing market share to pepsi

1360
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,760
because people were preferring the

1361
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,200
sweeter taste of pepsi

1362
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,599
so coke decided to get their scientists

1363
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,680
to design a new formula for coca-cola

1364
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,240
with more sugar they did hundreds of

1365
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,319
taste tests with various people

1366
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,480
and everyone prepared the new preferred

1367
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,680
the new flavor

1368
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,160
so they launched a big press campaign

1369
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,119
and

1370
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,640
invited people to test it for the first

1371
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,240
time and the journalists who turned up

1372
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,040
to the test

1373
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,880
to taste it for the first time had kind

1374
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,640
of been nobbled by pepsi

1375
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,119
and made did this big dramatic show of

1376
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,040
spitting it out and hating it

1377
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,520
and what then happened was this really

1378
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,920
weird cycle where everyone in america

1379
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,000
ran out to buy new coca-cola so that

1380
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,520
they could taste it so that they could

1381
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,200
take part in this conversation

1382
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,520
there were protests in the streets it

1383
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,200
went absolutely crazy

1384
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,319
people were driving around from from

1385
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,200
shop to shop panic buying the old flavor

1386
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,560
of coke

1387
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,599
um and and the you know the stockists

1388
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:58,880
were like worrying where can we get all

1389
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,319
the old coke and the old coke was kind

1390
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,839
of changing hands

1391
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,200
then what happened is um because of the

1392
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,560
backlash

1393
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,920
um a whole um they decided to re-release

1394
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,720
the old flavor as classic cola

1395
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,839
and everyone ran around tasting the uh

1396
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,160
again buying up all the old cola then

1397
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,599
there was this whole

1398
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,839
bunch of people who liked the new flavor

1399
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,280
who then went and panicked bought the

1400
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,480
new flavour because they thought that

1401
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,000
was going to get withdrawn

1402
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,720
and the whole thing was an absolute

1403
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,760
bonfire

1404
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,520
but on aggregate what happened is the

1405
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,680
sales of coca-cola went through the roof

1406
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,160
as a direct result of an absolute epic

1407
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:36,720
fail

1408
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,560
and i am convinced that it's exactly

1409
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,400
what arnott's tried to repeat with

1410
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,240
shapes by changing the flavor

1411
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,319
it was arrogant of them i don't think it

1412
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,280
really paid off but

1413
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,599
but yeah so crisis can turn out good

1414
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,160
and that's me

1415
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,880
[Applause]

1416
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,960

1417
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,480
