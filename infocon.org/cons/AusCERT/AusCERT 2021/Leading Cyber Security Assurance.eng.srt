security

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,000
so mark also has worked in operational

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,680
and architecture infosec roles

29
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,479
as well as lecturing his current focus

30
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,600
is governance risk

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,598
and compliance with particular passion

32
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,440
on cyber security education

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,239
awareness and cultural improvement right

34
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:14,879
so

35
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,680
i was fortunate enough to be part of the

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,040
training session yesterday

37
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,440
where when mark and alex were talking

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,520
through leading cyber security assurance

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,160
so

40
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,760
this is a fantastic course that's been

41
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,400
like squished down into a very short

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,599
presentation in the very

43
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,000
last minute of sorts so i'm very much

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,200
looking forward to

45
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,879
revisiting some of the information so

46
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,400
maybe some things things that i missed

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,360
so thank you very much

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,040
give them a warm round of applause thank

49
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,200

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,640
thank you very much lucas so um sorry

51
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,800
for anybody who was actually expecting a

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,319
different presentation

53
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,560
is stuck with alex and i and while we're

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,680
on apologies

55
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
i'd like to apologize to anybody who

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,440
attended our workshop yesterday and is

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,720
expecting to hear

58
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,120
anything different today because that's

59
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,080
not going to happen

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,280
we're going to speak faster sorry yes

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,400
we're just going to convince the

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,680
condensed about six hours of the

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,519
material into 35 minutes

64
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,319
no problem if someone could shut that

65
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,319
door for me that would be super duper

66
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:18,800
awesome

67
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,879
thank you if you haven't had a chance to

68
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,360
do

69
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,400
that to go to menchie.com

70
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,599
and enter that code could you please

71
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,839
do that really quickly

72
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,400
so to begin with we'd like to pay our

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,280
respects

74
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,680
to the traditional owners of the country

75
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,640
on which we

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,599
are meeting today we pay our respects to

77
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,640
elders past

78
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,200
present and emerging and just would like

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,040
to acknowledge the fact that these

80
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,599
lands have always been places of

81
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,840
education and sharing and sharing

82
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,720
information

83
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,080
so what is assurance from a cyber

84
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640
security perspective

85
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,879
let's take a look at our word cloud that

86
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,120
you've all had

87
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,680
so long to fill in

88
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
you could go you could go a little bit

89
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,519
quicker it'll be it'll be good

90
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,479
so the great thing about it maybe the

91
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,520
wi-fi

92
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,479
it could be it could be

93
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,320
the code one three three six zero four

94
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,080
six three

95
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,840
please look the thing i really love

96
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,120
about word clouds

97
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,600
is that you can get immediate input from

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,120
your audience and you can see what the

99
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,800
different perspectives are

100
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
in the room mentee meter is what we're

101
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
using today this is the free version it

102
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,160
still gives you

103
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,000
good functionality it's a really good

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
way to engage with your audience

105
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,160
whatever kind of training or engagement

106
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,120
you're doing especially

107
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,199
good with executive stakeholders because

108
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,440
they get to play with their devices

109
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,840
and you get to see what their opinions

110
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,360
are in an anonymous

111
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,560
ish kind of fashion

112
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,919
and it looks cool as it resizes itself

113
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,479
obviously the bigger fonts are words in

114
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,880
common

115
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,560
um so that's great that's that's

116
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,199
that's good to hear thank you mark as a

117
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
legend is particularly

118
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,080
um observant comment

119
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,199
well done lucas i'll give you that money

120
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,440
later on

121
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,720
all right let's go back to

122
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
the actual prezzo so

123
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,800
look there's lots of different

124
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,120
definitions about assurance but

125
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,199
here's a good one information security

126
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,479
assurance provides

127
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,280
objective assessment as to the security

128
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,840
of

129
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,280
information

130
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,639
the institute of internal auditors the

131
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,160
i i a revised their three lines of

132
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,919
defense model a few years ago you might

133
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,759
be familiar with the previous one this

134
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,000
is the updated one

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
it's now just called the three lions

136
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,360
model

137
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,759
the previous one was seen as being too

138
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,120
narrowly focused

139
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,600
on just defense and stopping bad things

140
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,560
from occurring

141
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,880
so the updated model is a little bit

142
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,319
more flexible

143
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,360
and it more accurately reflects the the

144
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,199
way that roles and responsibilities of

145
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,720
the different parties

146
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,199
associated with assurance need to work

147
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,800
together and communicate

148
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,520
and understand responsibilities and

149
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,080
accountabilities

150
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,319
um so this this is definitely an

151
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,000
improvement

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,400
particularly around role clarity and the

153
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,520
way that responsibility and

154
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,039
accountability should be

155
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,720
should be clearly communicated because

156
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,400
that's so critical to assurance

157
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,240
and it's flexible enough for people to

158
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,160
customize it in a way that's going to

159
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,360
suit their individual

160
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,919
context

161
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
so how much assurance is enough

162
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,039
assurance well

163
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,520
ultimately you'd want assurance to be

164
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
commensurate with the business impacts

165
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
of whatever information asset

166
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,319
or system we're talking about that needs

167
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,639
assurance

168
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,960
this is an example from a queensland

169
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,319
government document

170
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,520
about assurance and information security

171
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,360
classification

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,599
um these are just examples right the

173
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,440
whole point of this document

174
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,000
and these kinds of documents is that

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,639
this needs to be correct for the context

176
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,560
in which it's going to be used

177
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,759
especially

178
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,240
within the context of the risk appetite

179
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
of the risk owners

180
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,599
ultimately they're the people that are

181
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,800
accountable for risk

182
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,720
the management of risk so they should

183
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,240
have good input

184
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,400
into how much assurance is enough

185
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,639
assurance

186
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,479
of course sometimes some stakeholders

187
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,120
may want more assurance than information

188
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,960
security professionals might think is

189
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,360
warranted or perhaps sometimes they

190
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,919
might not want as much assurance as you

191
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,919
might think is a good idea

192
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,160
either way you have to adapt yourself to

193
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,000
suit the required circumstances

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,160
you know managing up is an important

195
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,319
skill

196
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,160
um and you have to adapt it to suit

197
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,000
suit the circumstances suit the context

198
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,280
alex thank you sir

199
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,240
all right where are we oh yeah so

200
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,120
allowing

201
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,159
aligning on the ground um i suppose

202
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,799
uh from what lucas said you know i spend

203
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,760
a lot of my time

204
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,039
going into organizations as the virtual

205
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,919
siso

206
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,959
for six to twelve months um

207
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,040
and trying to help them with improve

208
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,080
their governance

209
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,600
and and then ideally let go

210
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,680
or and let them stand up on their own

211
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,880
two feet and

212
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,720
and keep on going and improve what

213
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,959
they're doing

214
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,240
it's really important to have a clear

215
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,440
plan

216
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,600
when you are walking in to a new

217
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,800
organization

218
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,240
whether you're going to be there for the

219
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,959
long term or as i tend to be

220
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,120
there for a shorter term because you

221
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,959
only have a very short amount of time to

222
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,240
make change

223
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,839
and you want to make change stick

224
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,680
as much as you can and to make the

225
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,600
organization that you are

226
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,200
responsible for as as deciso or cso

227
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
increasingly in in organizations uh

228
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,800
as good as it can be for its

229
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,480
organization

230
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,080
so a couple of things um

231
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,959
the first six months uh plan is really

232
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,080
important as i said

233
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
you're going to be bombarded with lots

234
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,519
of ideas from many

235
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,880
stakeholders including malcolm tents

236
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
some of your information that you

237
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,320
receive in your first

238
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,040
weeks uh days weeks months is going to

239
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,160
be crap

240
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
some of it is going to be brilliant it's

241
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,920
going to be really difficult to filter

242
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,240
that

243
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,279
out be cautious with

244
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,279
with how you do it there's pressure to

245
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,800
perform of course

246
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
and and so how do you succeed in the in

247
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,760
in your new organization that you're

248
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,720
that you're trying to help

249
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,880
and uh the the big idea is uh ultimately

250
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,519
trying to

251
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,360
trying to build the airplane whilst

252
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,720
flying you're trying to get

253
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,200
do your strategic changes in the

254
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,320
organization

255
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,959
over your over your time but you've also

256
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,720
got to do all your tactical stuff at the

257
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,279
same time as well you've got to keep

258
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,880
keep everything flying everything

259
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,519
running and it and quite often it's ugly

260
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,560
in the first few weeks

261
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,399
these are some things that i think are

262
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,399
really useful in your first weeks and

263
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,399
months

264
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,160
to think about from my perspective

265
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,640
and this is in no particular order and

266
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,839
other people

267
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,839
do things slightly differently as well

268
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,440
um

269
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,279
so some of the questions you need to be

270
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,800
asking yourself who has

271
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,640
organizational power within your

272
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
organization

273
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,240
um there's formally informal power

274
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,760
usually an organization will have a

275
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
structural chart and you'll know who

276
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,079
your boss is

277
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,839
and your boss's boss and that's really

278
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,920
obvious but you should also

279
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,079
like uh start being curious about who

280
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,440
the other bosses are

281
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,760
and who the who who your cohort are that

282
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,200
you're going to be talking to

283
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
but also really really importantly

284
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,640
particularly in

285
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,959
in smaller organizations is what you

286
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,399
might call information

287
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,519
informal power um you know

288
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,720
who are the people who have a lot of the

289
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
knowledge within the organization

290
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
on what's done and how is it done

291
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,320
particularly if it's a smaller

292
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
organization and they don't document

293
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,720
anything

294
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,880
i'm sure there are none of those here

295
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,160
that you know of

296
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,279
around the place it's important to get

297
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,040
to know those people

298
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,320
the price of a coffee can i suggest is

299
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,440
super valuable

300
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,320
on on people around the place talking to

301
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,200
those people

302
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,240
talking to hr starting to talk to order

303
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,959
starting to talk to people who are doing

304
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:09,279
phys

305
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,639
sec and uh and persec if those people

306
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,360
exist

307
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,079
that's a big question to answer um

308
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,600
talking to the people who are

309
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,040
who are in charge of finance um

310
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,000
uh of course the other question that you

311
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,880
have to ask is

312
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,519
why what is the incident response

313
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,399
capability

314
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,440
and you have to start doing one-on-ones

315
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
if you don't know what one-on-ones are

316
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,959
ask that question

317
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,440
and we'll answer it at the end of the

318
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,839
preso

319
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,240
so does anybody know what that number is

320
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,880
207 days is the average time according

321
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,000
to poneman in the

322
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,120
2020 report you know

323
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,600
your experience may vary it's around

324
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,800
eight months

325
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,000
um between an organization discovering

326
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,399
that it's been owned and

327
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,720
and uh day zero so that means when the

328
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,519
moment that you

329
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,760
turn up at an organization you've got a

330
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,880
clock ticking backwards for eight months

331
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,320
um so that's why ir is a really

332
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,399
important thing to start as soon as you

333
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,200
absolutely can

334
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,160
so big questions what incident response

335
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,279
capability plans exist why as i said

336
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,120
you're accountable if not responsible

337
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,720
for from day one it's a sad story

338
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,079
but that's why they pay you the big

339
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,880
bucks you may already be breached

340
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,399
my approach is always simple dumb direct

341
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,920
questions

342
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,399
i know all a lot of you look a lot

343
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,440
smarter

344
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,800
and but just play dumb is my advice

345
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,440
and again use coffee tea whatever

346
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,240
beverage of choice you know questions

347
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,480
like i'm new here tell me how you do

348
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,440
this

349
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,560
tell me about tell me when you last

350
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,440
questions like cyber exercise when you

351
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
last detected something when you last

352
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,320
scanned

353
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,040
how do you do vulnerability scan just

354
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,320
really dumb

355
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,720
you know open-ended questions let's have

356
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,000
a conversation

357
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,440
not you know show us this you know hard

358
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,680
hard stuff you can get to that if you

359
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,880
need to later

360
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,240
just start soft

361
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,800
okay stakeholders and now

362
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,120
stakeholder analysis um in the talk

363
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,880
yesterday we spent quite a bit of time

364
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,160
talking about stakeholder

365
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,800
analysis in larger organizations

366
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,480
particularly when you're going to

367
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,680
when you know that you're going to go

368
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,760
through a big change process

369
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,199
say you're starting to work in an

370
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,000
organization like defense or

371
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,079
a really big multinational or so for

372
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,519
that you're going to have to go through

373
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,560
a change

374
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
management program now there will be

375
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
experts that can help you

376
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,120
but uh it it helps to actually start

377
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,000
thinking about

378
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,240
what which stakeholders matter we

379
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,519
started talking about

380
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,320
informal and formal power well you need

381
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,760
to start working out who

382
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,160
who are the stakeholders who matter if

383
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,440
you're going to make a change you're

384
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,880
going to have to make some

385
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,199
changes whichever way you want either

386
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,040
because the organization needs to

387
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,639
respond to the changing threat

388
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,600
environment

389
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,000
because it's a perfect organization but

390
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,920
it needs to keep on being

391
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,399
a perfect resilient organization or

392
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,040
because

393
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,440
it's a substandard organization and you

394
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,720
want to improve it

395
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,800
as much as it can be so that it can

396
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,720
respond to the changing threat

397
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,000
environment

398
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,199
so which stakeholders matter and you can

399
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,680
you can categorize those people as

400
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,399
people

401
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,959
broadly who who can help you who can

402
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,079
hinder you

403
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,199
who don't care and such like and there's

404
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,800
a lot of science in there

405
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,160
um and and there are a lot of people who

406
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,680
can help you with that sort of stuff but

407
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
you should be asking those sorts of

408
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,279
questions

409
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,639
this is important uh

410
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,839
mark talked about uh risk uh

411
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,079
appetite and risk tolerance you need to

412
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,320
be starting to align your organizational

413
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,480
security objectives to whatever the risk

414
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,120
tolerance

415
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,399
is within the organization that's really

416
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,839
really important because you need to

417
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,399
sort of

418
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,399
at least say well this is the direction

419
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,920
we want to take

420
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,240
the the security approach that you're

421
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,120
going to take

422
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,680
as an organization i know let's use an

423
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,560
example i always

424
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,600
like using the fish and chip shop is not

425
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,839
the same as if you are a defense

426
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,600
establishment

427
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,560
so um and and of course there are

428
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,959
advantages and disadvantages in both

429
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,120
so you need to actually sort of cut your

430
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,440
cloth

431
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,440
so and also in terms of your discussion

432
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
with which stakeholders matter

433
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,199
this is about part of getting

434
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,800
organizational support

435
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,240
for the inevitable change that changes

436
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,480
that you're going to have to make

437
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,039
at that cyso level don't ever go into

438
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,280
one of these organizations and say

439
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,799
we're not going to ever have to change

440
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,839
because you'll be left behind

441
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,280
and of course lots of people have talked

442
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,559
about identifying

443
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,079
meaningful measures and metrics

444
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,520
they tend to be different for different

445
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,600
organizations

446
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,559
and both qualitative and quantitative

447
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,799
measures and metrics are really useful

448
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,679
building the case

449
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,280
for change this is all part of that

450
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,520
and again still over the six months you

451
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,120
still have to keep that airplane flying

452
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
you still have to keep on doing all that

453
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,160
tactical stuff

454
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,600
so you have to then start thinking about

455
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
well your team needs to be better so

456
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,400
that you can give them all the jobs that

457
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,280
that that they can do so that you can

458
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,039
have the headspace to be doing all the

459
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,240
stuff at the top of those

460
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,799
top those points because the better your

461
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,520
team is

462
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,000
the better you can be so delegation and

463
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,640
coaching

464
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,120
passing on those tasks making sure that

465
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,679
people are doing stuff

466
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,280
so that you are free to have the

467
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,440
headspace to do that strategic thinking

468
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,720
that strategic approach

469
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,440
okay those of you who know me

470
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
uh know that i like talking about

471
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,200
goldilocks security

472
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,240
not too much not too little just right

473
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,520
incredibly hard to do to achieve

474
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,360
um but it's a nice little sort of

475
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,320
thing to talk about and again this is

476
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,280
very much

477
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,919
uh the shorthand of aligning

478
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,760
organizational objectives to what your

479
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,559
tolerance

480
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,480
and your risk appetite is within the

481
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,840
organization

482
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,160
this is what is the scope of security

483
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,480
within your organization

484
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,720
and the point that has to be made is

485
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,760
that security

486
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,720
as a function as an entity doesn't

487
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
decide what that is

488
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,000
it should be an expert advice it should

489
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,440
provide its view but ultimately

490
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,480
the risk owner i the ceo the minister

491
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,320
the director general whoever it is

492
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,760
and his or her leadership team

493
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,360
however that's described in the

494
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,200
organization has to do that

495
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,600
of course they need to be advised of

496
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
course they need to

497
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,799
to be you know given as much

498
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,000
good guidance as you can you as

499
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,679
almost the translator for security

500
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,320
of what the the implications of their

501
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,080
decisions are likely to be

502
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,799
but the ultimate decision maker has to

503
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,400
be the risk owner

504
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,440
and if it goes wrong they have to wear

505
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,520
it

506
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,000
so and somehow in in some ways i'm

507
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,679
repeating what i'm saying here but

508
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,120
it's worth saying it in a slightly

509
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,280
different way that the security at risk

510
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,240
appetite varies by the organization

511
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,960
of course it's very similar across

512
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,840
industries

513
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,960
so the appetite will be very similar in

514
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,039
banks of a similar size in

515
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,120
insurance agencies of a different of a

516
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,480
similar size in

517
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,799
intelligence agencies of a similar size

518
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,120
and and type and such like

519
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,919
and of course it's not fixed because you

520
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,280
we all know

521
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,679
that the threat environment continues to

522
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,000
change so that risk appetite is going to

523
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,440
change

524
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,960
and you have to keep on top of it

525
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,200
so your risk tolerance also has to

526
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,240
reflect the

527
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,280
acceptable variation in the outcomes

528
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,720
related to specific performance

529
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,360
uh measures linked to objectives this

530
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,080
entity

531
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,400
seeks to achieve so there is a

532
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,360
difference

533
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,159
and and i i think that sometimes we

534
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,600
forget that there is quite a big

535
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,000
difference

536
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,320
between what appetite is and tolerance

537
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,480
and hopefully this diagram actually sort

538
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,720
of gives you some idea of

539
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,240
of uh what that difference is so the

540
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,159
the appetite is the amount of risk that

541
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
the organization

542
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,559
is willing to take on a particular you

543
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,600
know

544
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,960
er in pursuit of of its particular

545
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,159
business aims

546
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,640
so this might be reflected in an

547
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,159
organization willing to

548
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,120
invest and take a 100 million dollar

549
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,159
risk

550
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,960
on a particular project the risk

551
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,440
tolerance is the variance in that

552
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,960
effectively to bear the risk if it

553
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,000
if it goes wrong and the risk capacity

554
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,360
that's the overall risk that

555
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,720
risks that can be taken by the

556
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,799
organization so

557
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,840
as an example a government may have

558
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,760
uh a budget

559
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,960
of three billion dollars so

560
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,600
in a year potentially its risk capacity

561
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,240
could be as

562
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,120
large as that but of course it doesn't

563
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,960
want to take that much risk

564
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,840
if it doesn't have to

565
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,280
sorry okay

566
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,039
risk appetite statement traps um

567
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,039
we've all seen bad risk appetite

568
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,400
statements um

569
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,440
i have a real bug bear for

570
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,799
certain things one of my biggest one is

571
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,760
the statement we have zero tolerance for

572
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,559
something

573
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,280
right um if you ever see this in a risk

574
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,640
appetite statement

575
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,880
um you know that whoever wrote it

576
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,880
doesn't know what they're talking about

577
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,080
because effectively if somebody says

578
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,120
that they have zero appetite to do

579
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,320
something

580
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,799
they won't do it right so if an

581
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,600
organization has zero appetite for fraud

582
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,960
then it shouldn't be dealing with

583
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,039
finances

584
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,320
so let's just

585
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,320
okay rant mode off okay um

586
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,840
you know that risk risk is simple in

587
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,960
theory

588
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,799
there are only four options effectively

589
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,799
that you can do you can mitigate

590
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,240
control you can accept and or transfer

591
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,600
and share right and i suppose if there

592
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,000
is

593
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,320
zero tolerance you can avoid the risk

594
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,240
you can stop doing an activity and that

595
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,960
is

596
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,039
that is effectively your choice of zero

597
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,960
tolerance that's the only time you have

598
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,440
zero tolerance to do something

599
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,159
um if you you know so

600
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,480
you have very few options as a as a risk

601
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,000
manager for what you what you

602
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,720
can do and there's always some element

603
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,480
of risk in anything you do

604
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,880
in crossing the road in walking up the

605
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,480
stairs or whatever

606
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
you might have zero tolerance for

607
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,720
tripping but that doesn't matter if you

608
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,840
decide to go up the stairs

609
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,039
of course the other thing is risk

610
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,799
appetite statements that don't tell it

611
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,760
like it is

612
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,320
that in some way tell some sort of

613
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,840
fanciful fairy story about about the

614
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,039
organization that's not good for them

615
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,880
it's not good for you

616
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,080
as a as a as a security executive within

617
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,679
the organization

618
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,080
because what it does is it holds you to

619
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,840
unreal expectations

620
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,760
it's sort of like the zero tolerance

621
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,158
statement

622
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,200
and the last one which happens an awful

623
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,279
lot is ones that are too vague

624
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,799
and not practically applicable a risk

625
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,960
appetite statement should be really

626
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,120
difficult to do

627
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,320
it should take the board of executives

628
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,400
a lot of argument to come at um

629
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,919
and well done

630
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,880
it should be quite fine-grained in terms

631
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
of saying well

632
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
you know we as an organization are

633
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,799
willing to take a particular risk in a

634
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,720
particular way

635
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,039
the other point is uh the lack of

636
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,400
degradation of

637
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,480
of risk or risk tolerance within the

638
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,159
organization

639
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,360
um by that i mean that obviously in some

640
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
organizations

641
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,240
you know they might they decide that

642
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,640
they're going to take a particular

643
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,840
the easy ones are probably financial

644
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,000
risk

645
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,320
maybe that organization says that the

646
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
board can sign off on a hundred million

647
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:32,799
dollar

648
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,600
financial risk and we're all familiar i

649
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,520
think with financial delegations we're

650
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,559
quite

651
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,919
comfortable with that and that's the

652
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,720
embodiment of a risk appetite

653
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,679
but we rarely see that in broader

654
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,279
security risk

655
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,120
you know that that the

656
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,200
a certain level is able to take a

657
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,559
certain security risk

658
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,799
a certain a higher level is able to take

659
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,559
a certain higher list

660
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,000
you do see it in the military

661
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,279
you know in dspf it actually allows

662
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,840
certain ranks to be responsible for

663
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,000
classification

664
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,600
of of documents who and that reflects

665
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,679
both the over classification of

666
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,840
information and the underclassification

667
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,679
of information

668
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,240
but it's rare to see it in in many other

669
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,240
contexts within the organizations

670
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,600
okay

671
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,799
defining and mean and implementing

672
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,840
meaningful metrics

673
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,960
um there is probably no one

674
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,679
perfect metric for any one organization

675
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,480
it's usually the best advice is what is

676
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,600
being used

677
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,640
within the industry within the field

678
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,919
and within the organization itself

679
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,240
if your organization is using

680
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,919
exclusively missed

681
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,880
frameworks then try and use them because

682
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,279
then you can speak the same languages

683
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,120
as as them if your organization is using

684
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,720
iso standards then

685
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,559
use the iso standards in the end

686
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,039
they're all trying to come at the same

687
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:19,679
thing

688
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,200
and in the end none of them are perfect

689
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,039
and we don't want the enem the perfect

690
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,320
to be the enemy of the good

691
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,000
be cautious about quantitative

692
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
or only using quantitative metrics

693
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,240
what i have seen personally is people

694
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,039
arguing

695
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,200
the point difference on quantitative

696
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,240
metrics

697
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,000
and what that means is you know

698
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,080
one person saying it's a 4.5 and the

699
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,480
other person's saying it's a five

700
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,880
and that might mean the difference

701
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,039
between two completely different actions

702
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,960
when what you're actually saying is on a

703
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,559
scale they're pretty close

704
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,039
and one's a little bit left of the other

705
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,080
one

706
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,799
um and that's where often qualitative

707
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,559
metrics can be useful

708
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,559
in terms of actually having a look at at

709
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,399
some of these things

710
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,520
but both um done well

711
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,480
uh can help

712
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,360
baselining is helpful as well because it

713
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,200
gives you a line in the sand it allows

714
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,240
you to celebrate your achievements

715
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,399
particularly if i go back to where i was

716
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,279
talking about

717
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,240
you have to implement change as a saiso

718
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,679
one of the big things

719
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,240
uh for those of you who came yesterday

720
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,919
we talked about kota

721
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,559
kotter is my favorite change management

722
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,120
hero

723
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,440
of how you do change management one of

724
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,320
the big things

725
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,919
is create wins along the way for your

726
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,760
change management if you can actually

727
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,960
find ways of celebrating wins in your

728
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,919
change process

729
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,279
even if you're not quite finished or

730
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,760
close to that's really good because it

731
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,600
you know it gives that psychological

732
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,840
impetus for people to go and you know do

733
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,720
that final

734
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,200
lift over the top or to the top of the

735
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,159
everest or what

736
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,200
however you want to use that description

737
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,880
um as i said there's lots of maturity

738
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,120
assessment frameworks uh

739
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,240
uh mark made the point that some of

740
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,120
these are

741
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,679
probably not technically maturity

742
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,279
assessment frameworks

743
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,480
but really use them but don't

744
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,440
think that they are necessarily the you

745
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:35,840
know

746
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,679
the perfection they are useful tools

747
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,480
they are not necessarily the be all and

748
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,880
end all

749
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,760
one thing that's really useful is

750
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,799
keeping an eye on trending

751
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,039
figures to trending metrics rather than

752
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,520
absolute metrics

753
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,240
is the organization improving rather

754
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,640
than

755
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,200
is it you know x number

756
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,679
this is worth just emphasizing in terms

757
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:10,000
of

758
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,960
when you are working uh at this iso

759
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,840
level

760
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,760
um biases we all have them

761
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,320
uh anchoring confirmation on

762
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,159
overconfidence if you go into this

763
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,520
into the literature there are hundreds

764
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,320
of biases

765
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,399
unfortunately we're human we're just

766
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,399
above uh bonobos

767
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,360
um so you know uh live with it

768
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,600
the problem is that in crises they can

769
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,279
be accentuated

770
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,720
we have effectively two brains um

771
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,600
we have a brain that works mostly in

772
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,440
crisis

773
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,159
you might call that type one 1 thinking

774
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,039
brain

775
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,840
and that is reactive fear-based and such

776
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,320
like

777
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,960
that is the brain that takes over in a

778
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,880
crisis

779
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,960
if security is being done of course it

780
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,360
is boring repetitive

781
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,919
and and just day to day and everything's

782
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:06,399
calm

783
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,519
but of course it never is and the

784
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,960
problem is that you can have make

785
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,880
critical errors of judgment if you are

786
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,159
not aware

787
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,240
of your biases don't be afraid of them

788
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,080
we all have them we're chimpanzees

789
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,720
this document here which you can find

790
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
site

791
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,640
colon.gov dot a u decision making during

792
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
crisis practical guide

793
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,760
is really good it talks a lot about that

794
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,640
don't know how much

795
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,919
running our time this

796
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,880
this comes from that document it talks

797
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,080
about

798
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,480
the processes for decision making during

799
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,720
a crisis

800
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,760
talks about psychological safety making

801
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,039
sure that you are

802
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,279
removing biases as much as you can in

803
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,720
your decision making

804
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,080
managing expectations and

805
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,159
and making sure that you're confirming

806
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,320
authority and direction and such like

807
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,440
really useful recommend it use it

808
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,840
please all yours

809
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,720
um yeah that document that alex is just

810
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,799
referring to it's extremely well written

811
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,320
and it's so nice to see a federal

812
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,919
government document that

813
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,760
actually talks about the way that people

814
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,039
behave

815
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,360
in reality rather than a nice perfect

816
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,519
process where we're all

817
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,519
we're all rational consumers which

818
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,880
doesn't actually exist in

819
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,320
in practice so um for the next couple of

820
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,399
slides let's have a quick chat about

821
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,519
diversity so look personally

822
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,240
i think it's a bit of a debate about

823
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,159
whether there really is a cyber security

824
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,360
skills shortage but

825
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,240
i know for sure that there definitely is

826
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,320
a diversity shortage in cyber security

827
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,600
so what is diversity diversity

828
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,080
is broadly speaking broken up into two

829
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,320
areas your social identity and your

830
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,840
professional identity

831
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,679
and it's all sorts of things this is a

832
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,600
really nice diagram to

833
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,880
to to summarize it

834
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,919
and part of a diversity is

835
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,519
how you perceive yourself and how you

836
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,080
perceive how other people perceive you

837
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,919
so what is inclusion well

838
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,960
inclusion is how we get the mix of

839
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,360
diversity in organizations to work

840
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,120
effectively together diversity on its

841
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,600
own

842
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,960
is a laudable goal but it won't

843
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,399
get the outcomes that we really want

844
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,600
and need as a society and as an industry

845
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,000
without effective inclusivity

846
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
so inclusion is

847
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,240
all the ways that people can feel

848
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,039
respected

849
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,039
for who they are and able to be

850
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,799
themselves

851
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,159
how they feel connected to their

852
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,679
colleagues and their sense of belonging

853
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,919
in an organization

854
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,520
how they perceive that they're

855
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,679
contributing their perspectives and

856
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,679
talents to their workplace

857
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,040
and how they're progressing in their

858
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,879
careers that is

859
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,760
how if if they're having equal access to

860
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,719
opportunities

861
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,520
and resources

862
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,440
diversity well before i go into that i

863
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,159
think this this

864
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,800
this is a great phrase that really sums

865
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,719
up the difference between diversity

866
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,320
and inclusion the diversity in cyber

867
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,879
security it's not just a moral issue

868
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,079
it's an issue of team success diverse

869
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,040
teams are

870
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,000
more innovative generally perform better

871
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,359
during crises

872
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,599
and are less likely to suffer from group

873
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,679
think

874
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,199
and that in its own should be a good

875
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,480
reason for people to be thinking

876
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,520
carefully

877
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,760
about they can harness the benefits of

878
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,440
diversity in their workplace because

879
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,240
groupthink can be particularly

880
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,560
corrosive to any kind of true innovation

881
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,800
the only way to realize these potential

882
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,599
benefits

883
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,000
is through effective inclusivity rather

884
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,599
than tokenism

885
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,400
if diversity is only a check box it

886
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,079
doesn't deliver good results

887
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,400
for anybody not for individuals not for

888
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,920
organizations

889
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,079
in fact you're very likely to result in

890
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,079
a large number of dis benefits

891
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,839
both for individuals and for

892
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,440
organizations

893
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,920
and that's all we had prepared in terms

894
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,720
of our

895
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,040
presentation proper so if anyone's got

896
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,160
any questions

897
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,400
you can ask them via the app or you can

898
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,599
just sing out

899
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,040
am i allowed to say that lucas because i

900
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,200
already did you can sing if you want

901
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,400
thank you uh there are a couple of

902
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,520
questions

903
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,400
and i thought one of them's going to be

904
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,359
answered judging

905
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,520
on what we discussed yesterday but it's

906
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
an abrupt stops a bit thank you

907
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,880
actually can we get a warm round of

908
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,280
applause because

909
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,200
six hours of content into 35 minutes

910
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,680
and how long did you have to prepare

911
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,800
about 24 hours

912
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,880
there we go so it was lack of sleep last

913
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,480
night most likely

914
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,480
well done uh there are a couple

915
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,240
questions on the q a

916
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,760
app so what questions would you suggest

917
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,800
during the one-on-one

918
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,240
look i suppose it uh we had a long

919
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,560
discussion yesterday about one once

920
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,800
the the purpose let's just go back to

921
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,760
the purpose

922
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,280
and then we can talk about the sorts of

923
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,520
questions one might ask the purpose of

924
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,440
one-on-ones

925
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,640
is several-fold right you are trying to

926
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,920
get to know as

927
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,119
the as the manager as the leader who

928
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:45,520
your

929
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,880
people are and you know what their wants

930
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,079
needs desires

931
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,680
are as as as workers right

932
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,000
so it should be mostly in their hands

933
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,960
um if you are if you're coming to them

934
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,599
with

935
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,000
you know here's 15 questions i want to

936
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,280
ask you

937
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,359
maybe the one-on-ones is not the right

938
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,240
forum for that because

939
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
what you're trying to do is get to know

940
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,720
them as individuals

941
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,000
and to build up trust your trust

942
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,560
of them and their trust of you and

943
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,040
that's

944
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,680
done through human interaction it's much

945
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,599
more difficult in covert times when

946
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,599
you're having to do this over zoom

947
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,560
and and i acknowledge that if you can go

948
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,480
and buy somebody a coffee

949
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,560
you know on a regular basis once a week

950
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,800
and have a quick half hour discussion

951
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,240
you know and you might be just talking

952
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,920
about the footy

953
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
you know if that's what they're what

954
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,200
they're into

955
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,560
yeah um

956
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,320
you know from a national security

957
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,839
perspective the reason why

958
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,680
why you do that is to try and get to

959
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,599
know your staff because you're worried

960
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,400
because you need as a as a manager in a

961
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,320
national security area

962
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,400
to make sure that you're dealing with

963
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,160
insider risk

964
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,680
insider threat that to a lesser extent

965
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,480
in

966
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,079
all workplaces but certainly from a

967
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,160
you know if you if you're working in a

968
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,440
in a secure area in a sensitive area

969
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,960
you're trying to work out are there's

970
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,480
people other things stressing this

971
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,280
person

972
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,839
you know are they are there kids pissing

973
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,440
them off

974
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,079
you know never happen husband wife you

975
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,200
know whatever

976
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,560
you know how can you help

977
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,839
that's what you're trying to do because

978
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,200
you're trying to humanize that

979
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,560
relationship

980
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,560
because um and i've said this previously

981
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,480
if you look you know if you're an

982
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,839
obsessive nerd about some of these

983
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,280
things like i am

984
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,560
um and you go and read the the the

985
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,240
report on warwick's

986
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,560
warren snowden warwick snowden anyway

987
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,720
the guy the spy who went to russia

988
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,960
edward edward snowden that's the one

989
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,920
edward snowden his brother was warren

990
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,680
anyway his his bosses

991
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,960
had never met him you know so

992
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,760
so and this is a guy who had tssci

993
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,440
clearance

994
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,040
and then they're surprised that this guy

995
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,839
is disgruntled

996
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,359
so you know i'll leave it to you

997
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,040
so one-on-ones are about grunties and

998
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,640
not disgruntleism do we have another

999
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,599
question

1000
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,520
there was yes uh so queensland

1001
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,800
government have mandated the

1002
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,880
implementation of isms

1003
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,200
in your experience what are the biggest

1004
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,879
challenges we are likely to face

1005
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,560
sorry suppose the government had

1006
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,520
implemented

1007
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,560
the the isms uh

1008
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,960
queensland government have mandated we

1009
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,599
implement

1010
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,240
isms yes so is 18

1011
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,200
which is the queensland government

1012
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,960
information security policy and

1013
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,320
note that i am not a queensland

1014
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,240
government employee so this is

1015
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,240
personal views not not the views of

1016
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,319
queensland government

1017
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,040
um what are the challenges in

1018
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,119
implementing an isms

1019
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,319
so the big the big challenges

1020
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,839
are trying to get alignment between

1021
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,800
your information security management and

1022
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,599
your risk

1023
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,160
appetite within the organization how do

1024
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,599
you do that

1025
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,520
by making sure that your most senior

1026
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,720
members of

1027
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,760
in this case your department are

1028
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,800
involved

1029
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,280
in actually determining what your risk

1030
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,240
appetite is

1031
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,280
and what the actual tolerance to risk is

1032
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,040
within the organization

1033
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,160
because that then should determine

1034
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,880
how much money they're willing to spend

1035
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,160
because effectively

1036
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,079
you know it's the pareto principle 80 20

1037
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,839
80 percent of of of costs of

1038
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,839
mitigating a risk can be

1039
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,800
mitigated with 20 percent cost the last

1040
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,839
20 percent

1041
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,560
costs 80 that's a principle it's an

1042
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,280
overall big

1043
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,839
arching thing so again it's a matter of

1044
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:10,480
how much

1045
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,880
how much the ceo stroke border

1046
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,319
management actually cares

1047
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,800
and so i think that that it's actually

1048
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,319
getting them to focus

1049
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,000
and to own that they that they have

1050
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,560
information security risk and to make

1051
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,240
those hard decisions

1052
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,599
they are accountable uh you know

1053
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,440
in the end for for uh for

1054
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,839
making sure that the information within

1055
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,480
the organization is secure

1056
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,000
now i know that there are a few uh

1057
