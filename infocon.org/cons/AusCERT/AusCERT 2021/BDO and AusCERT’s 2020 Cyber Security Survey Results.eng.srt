1
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,200
right apparently we're now live

2
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,479
good afternoon welcome to the final

3
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,880
breakout session of 2021

4
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,719
my name is valdemar jacobson from brook

5
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,000
security and i'm your chair this

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,799
afternoon

7
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,399
for our final session the breakout

8
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,320
stream we have the

9
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,560
mike ish and leon show mike's apparently

10
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,600
not going to be saying an awful lot

11
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,878
today

12
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,520
giving us a review of the bdo and

13
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,760
ozzer's 2020 cyber security survey

14
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,480
results

15
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,000
for anybody here who wishes to follow

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,360
along or anybody who should follow along

17
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,200
at home if you have a look in the q a

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,000
section

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
i've already dropped the link to the

20
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,800
registration page so you can download

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,480
the full survey results and have a look

22
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,120
there

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
but um we'll be getting the most

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,480
interesting highlights uh

25
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
from leon and uh and mike this afternoon

26
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,480
please make them feel welcome

27
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,879
good afternoon uh i think we've got a

28
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,560
great deal shift so between uh

29
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,200
between now and coffee break so we'll

30
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,879
try to keep it entertained

31
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,120
um

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,760
so this is actually the sixth year mark

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,519
that we've done the survey so we got a

34
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,080
lot of good

35
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,480
good insights and data so what we want

36
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,599
to talk through today is

37
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,920
um i think just take a bit of a step

38
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,840
back we've been through covet

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,640
um when i prepared this i wanted to sort

40
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,159
of look through what

41
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,680
bid organizations the journey they've

42
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,080
gone on during

43
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,800
preparation and response to gobit look

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,239
at some of the threats that

45
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,360
the profile has changed and then looking

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,159
at our data

47
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,000
again going through the life cycle of

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,599
what organizations have sort of gone

49
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,239
through

50
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,159
during covet what are some of the stats

51
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,680
that we've seen coming out

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,440
and then we're going to leave you guys

53
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,280
with um and girls with some

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,519
um some thoughts around how to manage

55
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,159
risk going forward

56
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,080
so in preparing for for this

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,599
presentation um

58
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,959
i was sort of doing a bit of research

59
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,280
trying to get some other data on

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,360
um how investments have actually gone

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
into covert

62
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,680
because if i reflect our own

63
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,080
organization in consultancy so we're

64
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,200
well prepared

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,159
it's easy to sort of send us back home

66
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,000
but i was actually calling the bank

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
um probably four or five months into

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,439
working from home

69
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,280
and it dawned on me there's a call

70
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,120
center and that person at a call center

71
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,799
was actually sitting at home

72
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,360
so that then sort of dropped a penny to

73
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,840
me is

74
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,000
look we prepared we're going home but

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,519
typically someone sitting in a call

76
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,959
center

77
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,280
did they get issued a company laptop

78
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,159
when they started

79
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,319
probably not but they're also working

80
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,439
from home

81
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,160
and if you look at the stats um sort of

82
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,798
the growth

83
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,880
of digital adoption and what normally

84
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,160
would have taken

85
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,000
um a year to sort of implement

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,080
technology is now fast track and if you

87
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,360
look at in

88
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,639
apac regions specifically it's sort of

89
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,240
four years of

90
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,759
digital implementations

91
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,720
sort of done within a year and i think

92
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,520
what's probably

93
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,680
reason for that is a lot of call centers

94
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,120
service centers are sitting in our

95
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,000
region

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,919
and that's that to me is admit i don't

97
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,680
haven't validated that but i think

98
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,960
that's the only sort of analogy that i

99
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,560
can draw on on that adoption

100
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,639
now that those because a few of you that

101
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,600
i remember

102
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
each year coming to the session each

103
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,199
time we sort of put up what is a

104
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,919
world economic forum um saying about uh

105
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,000
cyber risk and where does it sit

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
so unsurprising this year um

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,840
we got the crisis around um

108
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,400
infectious diseases as opposed to

109
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,919
sitting now top there we've got that as

110
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,919
a most likely a risk

111
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,600
what we've seen is cyber has actually

112
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
dropped off from a likelihood

113
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,520
perspective

114
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,960
but if you look at what's sort of still

115
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,280
sitting around those it's difficult

116
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
risk that you can actually manage the

117
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,560
likelihood of that happening so

118
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
really it's about addressing the impact

119
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,520
now this year's survey and i really

120
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,800
encourage you to sort of go and read

121
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,840
that report from the world economic

122
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,080
forum

123
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,759
i think it's a section that's dedicated

124
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,759
on yes if you take out

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,080
covet and what are the risks then from a

126
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,000
what are the concerns for people and

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,759
organizations over the next couple of

128
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,880
years

129
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,800
and then cyber is back and within the

130
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,919
top five

131
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,840
um and the other one is sort of popping

132
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,039
up that's quite interesting

133
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,479
is um sort of the adoption of digital

134
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,479
technologies or the lack thereof

135
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,840
and i think specifically in

136
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
underdeveloped countries

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,360
it's probably going to be difficult to

138
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,120
keep on working remotely so it's

139
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
interesting to see

140
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,000
how that's going to pan out over the

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,080
next couple of years

142
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
now if you look at the sources of

143
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,360
threats and i was really

144
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,199
looking forward to sort of get the stats

145
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,880
from this year's survey or last year's

146
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,720
survey

147
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,039
and what we've seen is that there's

148
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,240
still a big concern

149
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,039
and has been an uptake of reported and

150
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,160
this is not

151
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,960
attributed attacks it's basically asking

152
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,199
the respondents to

153
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,960
sort of give their own view of where the

154
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,880
threats and risks were coming from

155
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,039
so there's an increase in foreign

156
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,800
activity and we've seen that a steadily

157
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,240
increase

158
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,759
what is interesting there's a decrease

159
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,199
in concern around

160
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,199
service providers or data center

161
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,360
providers but then there's a steady

162
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,800
uptake in concern around supply chain

163
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,240
as well as insiders on employees

164
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,599
the next one i want to talk to you about

165
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,919
is basically if you look at

166
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,280
um the types of security incidents that

167
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,319
has happened and the the graph there is

168
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,560
basically the the bar chart on the left

169
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,639
hand side is saying it's the incidence

170
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,599
that actually was

171
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,160
that we that was reported last year the

172
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,520
line that's sort of through there is to

173
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,199
show the same question we asked the year

174
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:23,680
before

175
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,199
is what are your concerns that you

176
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,199
expect in the coming year

177
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,199
and this is a keep on a trend coming up

178
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,919
that phishing

179
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440
when you ask the question what's your

180
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,520
concern for the next year it's not a

181
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
bigger concern but if you look at the

182
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,319
data coming through

183
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,360
it's still fairly high data loss and

184
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,720
concern around

185
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,280
that is a is a major concern so

186
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,360
organizations are really concerned about

187
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,160
data loss but if you look at the results

188
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,360
coming through

189
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,039
it's not really that big

190
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,520
mike thanks leon um oh you can hang on

191
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,960
to that i guess

192
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,360
so what we've actually done obviously

193
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,319
with this survey

194
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,160
is because this goes out to all of our

195
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
members and it goes out to all of bdo's

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,960
clients

197
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,800
you've got quite a good reach across the

198
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,120
nation to gather those statistics

199
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,560
and of course that's great you've got

200
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,879
statistics that tell a story and they

201
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,199
really do tell a story

202
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
what really rams that home i suppose for

203
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,479
me at least

204
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,280
is when you then compare that to actual

205
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,360
incident data that's been collected

206
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
uh by us by the analysts that work in

207
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,800
osset because these are the ones that

208
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,840
are actually dealing with those

209
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,440
incidents as they're coming through

210
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,279
from all of our members in this country

211
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,640
and new zealand

212
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
so what we actually ended up doing and

213
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,080
this this only came up

214
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,919
literally in the last couple of days in

215
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,320
fact there was a conversation between

216
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,519
uh one of the uh senior security people

217
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,200
at one of the universities

218
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
and one of the analysts here at this

219
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,040
conference actually one of uh assets

220
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,320
analysts

221
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,880
and the conversation went around well

222
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,240
what can we actually learn

223
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,440
from the information that we have

224
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,680
available to us now what can we actually

225
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,040
do with that

226
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,160
and someone suggested look

227
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,200
i think phishing actually increases

228
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,240
whenever there is exam blocks at the

229
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,440
university

230
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
so it makes sense right so you look at

231
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,640
this graph

232
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,800
you can actually see um and you'll have

233
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,000
to excuse the format

234
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,920
we've done this in iso weeks not not

235
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
dates so just use your imagination

236
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,760
count the number of weeks you can

237
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,680
literally see the four

238
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,320
distinct exam blocks so obviously the

239
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,839
attackers understand

240
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,360
students are distracted there's other

241
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,040
things they're doing they're more likely

242
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,560
to just click through the phishing link

243
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,240
and give their credentials

244
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,880
so here's a real life example of

245
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,240
effectively

246
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,720
know your enemy but what then can you do

247
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,240
about it well obviously that's where you

248
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,440
go to things like education programs

249
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,480
user education more fishing training

250
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,640
never victim victim blaming of course

251
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,959
but certainly giving some kind of

252
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,519
training at targeted times to combat

253
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,480
those

254
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,120
those threats we might just go to the

255
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,000
next slide please

256
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,200
leon and from here you can actually see

257
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
the wider picture so i showed you a very

258
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,320
very small

259
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,800
piece of statistics before just the

260
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,600
fishing

261
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,720
spread out across the iso weeks this is

262
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,000
all of the incidents that

263
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
assert um faces and uh guess what the

264
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,880
biggest one is

265
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,920
it's fishing again so that correlates

266
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,480
exactly with the the data that we saw

267
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,920
come through the survey

268
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,040
and it actually inspired um we saw this

269
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,920
coming obviously

270
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,760
you can see in statistics you can see

271
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,040
whenever there's a ramp up

272
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,640
and we saw this coming quite a long time

273
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,040
ago and one of our senior analysts

274
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,079
um that works in offset actually uh sort

275
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,839
of threw out all of our old processes

276
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,160
and

277
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,880
systems and said we can do this better

278
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,800
and decided that there was a way that

279
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
you could workflow

280
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,959
taking a phishing site understanding

281
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,399
what the

282
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,160
the tools techniques and practices were

283
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,640
of that particular example

284
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,120
catalog it put it into a system and then

285
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,079
track the incident through to completion

286
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,320
incidentally i was just in nick

287
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,519
pratley's talk

288
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,399
next door this way i think and part of

289
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,279
the saw

290
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
process is actually to build those

291
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,680
playbooks up over time

292
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,519
we might not have necessarily been

293
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,200
calling it saw when we were doing it but

294
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,519
we were actually following that process

295
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,279
what we now have is a fully automated

296
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,680
system that can take a url

297
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,800
go and examine that site collect the the

298
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,320
image of what what's happening on that

299
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,880
thing

300
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,959
uh gather information about the site how

301
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,640
long it's been up when was the domain

302
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,440
registered

303
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,279
all of that sort of stuff and then

304
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,040
obviously bring that to a closure and

305
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,079
that's something that we're really good

306
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,160
at because we've got those contacts from

307
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,560
uh you know 20 something 27 years of

308
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,760
being assert

309
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,560
so uh you can use like statistics uh you

310
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,079
know sounds like a boring topic but you

311
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,360
can actually use it

312
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,800
to do real life improvements to your saw

313
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,839
examples

314
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,240
back to you leon uh just interesting you

315
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,880
see the

316
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,440
the sort of a looks like a cycle any

317
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,320
comments on

318
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,600
any insights on that we incidentally we

319
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,720
changed between the 2019 calendar year

320
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,600
and the 2020 calendar year we completely

321
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,560
changed our

322
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,800
incident tracking system and ergo all of

323
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,639
the classification schemes

324
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,600
so as we did that we we obviously

325
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,040
reclassified all the different

326
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,399
categories and everything

327
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,959
but what you'll see is distinct trends

328
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,959
towards certain points of the year

329
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,519
now past life i was in banking what

330
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,720
happens in

331
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,320
march into march is usually easter

332
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,800
now at easter time believe it or not the

333
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,079
banks actually see

334
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,399
more transaction flows because it's a

335
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,920
short period of time everyone's on

336
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,880
holidays

337
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
they see a higher transaction flow there

338
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,399
than christmas even

339
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,440
so that's my suggestion why the march

340
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,120
one might actually be an increase in

341
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
incidents because there's more activity

342
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,720
then you go further throughout the year

343
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,320
what happened last year well we all got

344
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,560
locked down in maine brisbane

345
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,360
covert took in and then in september a

346
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,560
lot of us were then back

347
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,120
out so there were obviously new threats

348
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,880
and new things that we were doing

349
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,040
that was our take on this but you may

350
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,560
have a different idea and feel free to

351
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,079
send that through in the app and we'll

352
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,200
discuss it thanks mike

353
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,760
so if you now look at we've really

354
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,880
looked at typical

355
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,639
where we've gone through in in the

356
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,440
covert journey so we started off

357
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,360
really responding to um to covet so we

358
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,959
we send people home

359
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:31,920
want to make sure that they're

360
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,040
productive a lot of organizations then

361
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,240
realize that look they're not

362
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,360
really ready to um to work from home

363
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,800
so we started there's a bit of

364
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,079
investment going in and you can talk to

365
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,360
any of the software

366
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,160
vendors and hardware vendors there's a

367
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,240
big sales coming in

368
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,079
then it started to okay well we've now

369
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,600
invested let's start

370
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,800
adopting the way we we we work through

371
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,600
this

372
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,560
and then it's about starting assess how

373
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,000
well are we working we've now started

374
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,880
adopting

375
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,480
and i think we're now in a phase where

376
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,560
we start looking at

377
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,639
trying to sustain us and a good example

378
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,279
one of our government clients approached

379
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,560
us and saying

380
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,199
we go it's happened we've been sort of

381
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,000
not operational

382
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,160
it's a court system we want to actually

383
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,199
keep on running

384
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,240
courts so we wanted to just you to come

385
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,920
into the risk assessment not a technical

386
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,800
assessment

387
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,120
a risk assessment of the video

388
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
conferencing environment making sure

389
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:28,880
that

390
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,600
it's okay and sustainable and i would

391
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
say that was probably sitting in

392
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,120
during the um the invest phase

393
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,199
they wanted to before they roll it out

394
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,560
just to have a bit of a rapid risk

395
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,480
assessment

396
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,320
and then six months later because it was

397
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,920
going to be a short-term solution

398
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,600
um they just wanted to get get it

399
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,760
running and then towards the end of last

400
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,279
year they contact us again

401
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,480
saying you know what this is actually

402
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,880
working well why don't you just come and

403
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,800
do a penetration test now and making

404
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,839
sure that

405
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,839
actually we've plucked all the holes and

406
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,360
the point i'm making there is that we're

407
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,440
starting to see organizations now

408
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,959
it was just about responding sending

409
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,720
people home they've changed the whole

410
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,320
business operation

411
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,600
and this is something we're going to

412
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,680
keep on uh having to um

413
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,600
to be aware of so then what i wanted to

414
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,720
do is actually

415
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,120
looking at each of those phases and

416
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,880
looking at the type of results we're

417
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,240
getting through

418
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,440
and so from my adapt and assess sorry

419
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,519
from a respondent invest is really

420
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,839
we're sending people home and

421
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,880
interesting um what we're seeing is that

422
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,440
there was a lot more reports going to

423
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,639
the board so there's a lot more

424
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,519
communication

425
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,880
happening between the head of security

426
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,440
and sort of checking in to see are we

427
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,199
seeing more incidents so that's a great

428
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:45,519
thing

429
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,160
seeing that that investment's been there

430
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,440
interestingly

431
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,000
although most organizations saying they

432
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,759
they invested in additional

433
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,480
technology what we see coming through

434
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:56,880
was

435
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,079
there wasn't really something that's

436
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,920
standing out

437
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,199
the only one sort of stood out as

438
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,600
patching started to increase

439
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,920
i think just the security teams probably

440
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,120
had to apply

441
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
new technology and which is why they

442
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,040
started to apply new patches

443
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,440
but nothing else sort of stood out as

444
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,639
really um

445
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,920
we started investing in that so now

446
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,800
we're in the

447
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,120
you adapt and assess so that's the face

448
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,360
where we've done the investment

449
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,839
um and now let's just take a step back

450
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,959
making sure that we

451
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,880
sort of understand the risk where we're

452
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,240
sitting

453
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
and again what's coming out there is

454
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,920
that there's more risk assessments

455
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,279
that's undertaken which is actually a

456
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,560
great thing

457
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,720
but it's one thing to do a risk

458
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,399
assessment if you've got a good baseline

459
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,839
and if you look at they're still not

460
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,920
really great baselines to find and you

461
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,680
would expect that at least

462
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,040
now that the business environment's

463
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,360
changed your risk posture has changed so

464
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,639
your requirements

465
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,160
should have changed to do those

466
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,000
assessments

467
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,360
and then the other one is a fairly

468
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,079
minor step up in getting capability for

469
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,079
instant response because now your team

470
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,640
your work for sitting at home um so

471
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,160
there's more capability that

472
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,480
sort of acquired i don't know mike did

473
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,640
you you guys see more members coming on

474
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,280
board

475
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,000
um during the covert period actually we

476
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,039
did leon the

477
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,760
um our membership team obviously uh work

478
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,119
all year round and you know last year

479
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,160
was no different

480
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,559
and we were sort of thinking um you know

481
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,280
obviously

482
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,199
there'll be a downturn in business

483
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,720
because like everything

484
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,360
um you know cyber security funds in

485
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,640
organizations may be cut

486
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,039
but we actually saw not only a

487
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,160
continuation

488
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,960
but a slight spike as well so there was

489
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,400
definitely an investment at least

490
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,280
towards

491
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,160
offset services

492
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,840
so now we're looking at we're in the

493
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,080
sustain phase and what we

494
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,400
looked at is um we've sort of defined

495
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,280
and identified

496
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,559
the top five controls or areas of um

497
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,160
of where we've seen investment it's gone

498
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,720
into from a preparedness perspective so

499
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,919
what they looked at is that those

500
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,000
organizations that

501
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,080
were not prepared before and those that

502
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,280
are now um

503
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,039
have gone well and they responded well

504
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,400
to covet

505
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,679
what were the things that they actually

506
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,320
had in place and we identified that

507
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,760
having a sizo in place having a security

508
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,840
operations capability to actually

509
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,679
respond to something that should happen

510
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,200
it's doing those regular risk

511
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,520
assessments investing in

512
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,160
awareness training and then the last one

513
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,960
is really around

514
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,400
having that instant response plan and

515
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,440
capability in place

516
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,120
so if you look at we don't really have a

517
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,559
lot of data

518
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,160
to sort of try to align back to the

519
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
theme there's a few questions around

520
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,640
threat intelligence and we just looked

521
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,679
at

522
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,200
those organizations that had threat

523
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,960
intelligence capability

524
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,480
how well were they aligned to the

525
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,160
business objectives and we seen that

526
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,080
there's definitely a trend there um

527
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,520
then we also looked at those

528
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
organizations that had

529
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,600
threat intelligence capability in

530
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
receiving that

531
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,360
what were the quantum of the

532
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,960
preparedness when

533
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,600
you look at data breaches and cyber

534
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,559
incidents

535
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,000
and i was actually a bit surprised to

536
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,679
see that i expected

537
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,360
if you have got ctr you should be better

538
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,520
prepared but that's not really coming

539
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,400
out in in our statistics um i don't know

540
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,039
my minor thinking around that is that i

541
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,240
think there's a lot more

542
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,320
intelligence out there or in freight

543
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,760
information i'm not sure if it's

544
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,039
actionable

545
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,880
um but it's probably something we'll

546
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,039
look at in incoming surveys i don't know

547
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,480
mike you've got any thoughts on that

548
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,120
absolutely leon the the thing that we've

549
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,200
discovered over the last couple of years

550
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,280
is you can have all of the threat

551
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,200
intelligence in the world

552
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,360
it's obviously what you then can do with

553
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,120
that in terms of your own internal

554
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,320
capability

555
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,120
and uh you know look as an employer of

556
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,400
analysts um

557
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,360
who are motivated more by seeing

558
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,280
advancement in cyber security and seeing

559
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,320
threats mitigated in our members

560
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,240
they really appreciate when they can

561
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,919
actually do some good with our members

562
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,480
so imagine our dismay when we

563
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,159
you know we started operating the the

564
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,840
court at isaac if anyone's familiar with

565
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,280
the university sector the higher

566
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,200
education sector here we're running a

567
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,960
information sharing and analysis center

568
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,720
in there there's a couple of

569
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,840
uh you know really key players in that

570
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,280
area a couple of universities are

571
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,600
contributing intelligence back into that

572
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,280
assert obviously is doing a lot of the

573
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,240
analysis and

574
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,120
threat correlation and curation of the

575
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,039
data that's in there and that's great

576
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,120
but in terms of actually getting that

577
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,480
actionable

578
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
cyber threat intelligence out of that

579
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,520
system or out of that repository

580
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,720
and into your institution in a form that

581
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
you can use

582
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,559
that was where you know we we sort of we

583
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,080
almost ran up against a brick wall in

584
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,679
some regards because

585
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,600
the capability just simply wasn't there

586
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,360
in a lot of institutions

587
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,280
sure that you know the top end of town

588
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,960
the group of eight universities not a

589
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,679
problem

590
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,159
um but some of them literally had you

591
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,280
know one person

592
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,600
doing cyber security uh for the whole

593
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,320
university

594
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,480
and actually being able to then process

595
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,720
that into something that will defend

596
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,320
against threats was difficult

597
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,640
so we had to shift gear in terms of what

598
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,400
are we actually going to do for those

599
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,520
organizations

600
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,039
and that's where of course your training

601
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,880
and maturity uplift

602
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,840
kicks in so it's it's not as easy as it

603
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,039
seems

604
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,799
yeah i think i mean if you look last

605
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,280
year's 2020 cyber strategy one of the

606
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,559
components in there was to actually

607
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,440
really

608
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,360
up and build up our threat intelligence

609
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,039
capability

610
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,360
i was talking to the queensland

611
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,480
government qd

612
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,039
cdg folks oscillator stand

613
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,440
out in in the vendor area and it was

614
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,120
actually quite interesting a lot of

615
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,600
startups there is really working around

616
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,200
threat intelligence

617
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
open source intelligence collection so i

618
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,799
think it's great to see that

619
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,240
um the government's actually really

620
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,400
putting the effort into supporting the

621
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,840
strategy

622
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,280
and we're definitely seeing that there's

623
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,960
a lot of activity in that space so

624
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
um hopefully we can talk more about that

625
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,600
in in the next session

626
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,760
so sort of just to then step back and

627
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,960
say um

628
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,640
what are what are sort of my key

629
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,720
takeaways looking at

630
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,080
go with the last um 12 months looking at

631
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,240
the survey results coming through

632
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,080
and we don't want to really use the word

633
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,280
new norm because

634
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
i think it's overused but really there's

635
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,200
four things for me that that stood out

636
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,679
that

637
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,240
i think we need to keep in mind the

638
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,360
first one is uh

639
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,840
around we're sending the workforce been

640
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,720
sent home

641
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,440
we communicate remotely so i think it's

642
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,039
important that we

643
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,360
as practitioners and and owners of

644
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,039
organizations understanding

645
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,640
what is the risk to actually working

646
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,159
remotely

647
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,159
looking at that mckinsey report that

648
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,360
sort of showed the adoption of

649
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,559
technology that would normally would

650
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,760
have taken a year

651
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,559
takes has now been sorry would have

652
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,840
taken three to four years

653
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,880
it's been done in a year i don't think

654
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,360
enough

655
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,120
analysis and assessment was done around

656
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,360
that the next one is around actually

657
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,240
storage of

658
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,200
information and data in the cloud a lot

659
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,640
of organizations that

660
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,320
weren't prepared necessarily to work

661
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,640
remotely have started adopting

662
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,840
cloud technologies are we sure that we

663
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,280
understand what's going in there

664
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,880
are we classifying the information are

665
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,600
we monitoring that

666
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
i think the other one is really the

667
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,799
human firewall

668
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,640
um i've been thinking about this is

669
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,039
we've almost think about it as

670
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,280
um you created your workforce is your

671
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,400
army you send them

672
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,240
home you're prepared to give them all

673
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,600
the technology

674
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,840
and tools to sort of be ready to be

675
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,520
sitting in the trenches

676
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
but have we provided enough training to

677
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,840
them because that's the first barrier

678
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,200
of activity i mean if we look at

679
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,120
ourselves myself

680
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,640
i'm getting probably three to four times

681
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
more emails a day than what i got

682
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,360
a year ago now i'm a security

683
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,440
practitioner so i can sort of

684
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,200
work through that but if you look at

685
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,880
that call center

686
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,720
individual that didn't get issued a

687
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,919
laptop

688
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,080
but they know working from home um

689
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,320
probably on their own technology

690
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,679
see i think it's important that we need

691
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,159
to make sure our own staff but also our

692
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,880
supplier staff are probably educated

693
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,640
and then i think the last one is really

694
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
if it all goes wrong at least have a

695
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
plan in place to respond to that

696
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,039
because if i look at all the

697
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,320
investigations that we've been

698
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,559
involved in where there's been a data

699
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,600
breach

700
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,120
one of the main things that's sort of

701
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,039
standing out is there was not a plan

702
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,720
we were trying to make it up yes we had

703
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,279
a plan but no one followed the plan

704
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,960
um and it wasn't really that touch

705
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,200
points on checking to see are we doing

706
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,720
the right thing

707
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,440
indeed we see exactly the same thing and

708
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,400
one of the most

709
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,720
um i guess i'm not going to use the word

710
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,400
disappointing but

711
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,360
one of the things that just makes you

712
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,159
want to cry is when one of our own

713
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,640
members doesn't have in their incident

714
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,840
response plan

715
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,559
the phone number for the oscert analyst

716
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:56,960
team

717
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,159
it's a 24x7 number that is is

718
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,240
uh looked after by a team of analysts

719
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,440
all year round

720
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,120
and you know during an incident they'll

721
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,279
have to you know you know what what do i

722
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:07,760
do

723
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,320
so just having that information there is

724
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,279
the best place to

725
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,679
to be prepared now interestingly i've

726
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,400
just

727
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,159
made a mental connection in my mind just

728
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,760
as i'm standing here

729
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,000
everything that leon has put on this

730
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,120
slide here

731
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,159
was summed up extremely well in jess

732
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,360
dodson's speak

733
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,480
a speech yesterday morning girl james on

734
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,320
twitter if you if you don't know her

735
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,720
um she's actually written almost

736
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,480
effectively this exact

737
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,679
sequence in a checklist and i i said

738
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,279
afterwards to her i said for a small

739
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,200
business that doesn't have a capability

740
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,320
like

741
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,000
you know being able to reach out to leon

742
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,520
or or even

743
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,919
a not-for-profit organization like us

744
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,080
that checklist that she's put up

745
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,159
takes you through these sorts of things

746
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,120
in

747
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,720
a language that a small business would

748
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,880
be able to understand and cope with

749
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,000
um if not hand out to an msp or

750
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,120
something like that to actually

751
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,919
implement

752
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,559
so the tools are definitely there for

753
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,480
any range of business

754
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,240
top end of town all the way down to

755
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,960
small to medium enterprise

756
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,360
so yeah um if you look at those four

757
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,400
there it's not

758
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,840
technology is not going to solve that

759
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,159
problem um and i think if that's the

760
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,159
the message there is around it's all

761
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,520
about the people in the process not

762
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,039
saying technology is not important but

763
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,480
it's the people and process side

764
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:39,840
that's us

765
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,039
thanks mike and leon we do have a couple

766
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,960
of questions from the audience

767
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,279
um first of all is um can you give us

768
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,200
any insights

769
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,760
on the uptake of cyber insurance

770
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,919
especially over the last year

771
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,240
that one's for you leon um

772
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,720
we we did focus a lot of energy in

773
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,039
previous

774
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,039
surveys but to be honest it's not

775
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,960
something we specifically looked at

776
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,120
but in reflection on a few presentations

777
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,400
here and

778
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,559
just some of the the incidents that we

779
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,919
helped investigate it

780
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,880
um insurance companies definitely is

781
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,000
starting to to get more involved in that

782
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,880
i think insurance providers are getting

783
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,399
better at actually providing

784
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,840
insurance cover for that so yeah

785
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,760
definitely there's been a small uptake

786
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,200
but unfortunately i don't have the

787
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,919
statistics

788
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,000
we can we can provide that data to you

789
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,120
i think just another uh brain

790
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,080
um synapses flop fired i remember

791
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,760
thinking when i was working through an

792
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,399
incident

793
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,960
um with with one of our members i

794
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,080
remember thinking

795
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,240
i'm actually surprised what cyber

796
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,000
insurance covers

797
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,279
so in terms of i mean obviously the um

798
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,760
the damages but also in the cleanup

799
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,480
operation

800
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,000
there are a lot of aspects there that

801
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
you may not know are actually covered

802
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,520
so i guess if you do have cyber

803
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,600
insurance you like any insurance policy

804
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,399
you better read it

805
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,279
make sure you know what you're getting

806
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:09,600
good

807
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,200
good so that question does it come from

808
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,279
your audience here or someone online

809
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,120
uh it's from anonymous so i'm afraid i

810
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,559
can't uh tell you that

811
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,919
do you work for an insurance company

812
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,600
here oh just i mean if

813
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,039
that person is around just grab me

814
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,600
afterwards we can get the statistics and

815
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,399
share it with you

816
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,919
otherwise they can now get your contact

817
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,799
information from the report or

818
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,919
i don't think we actually got anything

819
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,520
in the report this year i mean it's in

820
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,440
the data so happy to provide that

821
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,080
separately um does the survey survey

822
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,919
highlight which sector has better threat

823
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,200
intelligence and sharing

824
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,240
which sectors sorry does the survey

825
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,480
information or the full data set are you

826
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,760
able to draw conclusions or does it

827
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,799
highlight which

828
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,320
sectors or groups actually um more use

829
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,760
threat intelligence and which ones are

830
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,279
actually sharing intelligence between

831
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,320
themselves

832
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,960
um we got the data but um i we didn't

833
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,399
this year specifically look at that

834
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,559
um i think banking traditionally has

835
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,399
been more actively in sharing that

836
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,360
um so i don't know from your side mike

837
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,039
have you seen more active more members

838
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:09,679
coming in

839
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,240
um because i know higher education is is

840
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,600
by far the

841
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,679
the biggest members of europe struggling

842
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,559
to find in my mind and a sector that is

843
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,320
doing it better than higher education at

844
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:20,960
the moment

845
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,080
and it's higher education been

846
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,240
increasing their information yeah oh

847
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,880
yeah

848
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,600
very much so it's a coordinated approach

849
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,240
now

850
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
um unique in that sector we heard some

851
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,159
of that last night um with uh

852
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,159
of course awarding simon the cyber

853
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,760
security professional of the year so

854
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,200
he's obviously been helping advance that

855
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,039
which is fantastic to see

856
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,679
um and yeah yes yes simon of course

857
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,200
um and the last question i've actually

858
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,799
got here at the moment um which is a

859
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,440
good one

860
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,279
given the trending information you've

861
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,399
actually been gathering over the last

862
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,840
few years

863
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,520
and given what's happened over the past

864
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,960
18 months

865
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,799
are we still able to use past and

866
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,480
current survey information to actually

867
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,760
give a reasonable prediction of the

868
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,399
future

869
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,840
or did covert 19 in the entire upset to

870
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,200
the business practices of pretty much

871
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,880
every company

872
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,320
throw trust banner in the works i think

873
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,720
that's a really good question

874
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,640
i was looking forward to look at this

875
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,240
year's data given the

876
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,640
um the change in the threat profile

877
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,919
wanted to see

878
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,720
how we've changed investing in security

879
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,600
and

880
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,120
it was surprising to see that there

881
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,200
wasn't that many different changes um

882
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,799
i think you're still you're spending

883
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,960
technology but the technology was still

884
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,880
investing in the same areas

885
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,039
i still think that and this is sort of

886
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,120
the the slide that i showed on

887
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,600
where were we thinking the incident is

888
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,799
going to come from

889
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,320
where do we experience it and what are

890
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,799
our concerns so the concerns is around

891
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,919
supply chain

892
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,240
concerns is around data loss but if you

893
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,679
look at the threats on

894
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,039
all the incidents are not coming through

895
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,520
there so if organizations are concerned

896
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,480
about that

897
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,240
i i personally think that i don't think

898
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,399
we are we've got a handle on

899
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,960
what's the threat in the supply chain

900
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,159
and also then

901
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,760
how much data would you really lose

902
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,000
because we don't classify information if

903
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,679
you look at the investment in data loss

904
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:06,320
prevention

905
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,799
it is sitting on the order of 70 of

906
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,159
organizations fields they've got in

907
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:10,880
place

908
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,039
so overall the similar trends you

909
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,399
expected it to be

910
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,799
different but that didn't come through

911
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,000
in the survey results

912
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and we ran it towards the end of last

913
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,120
year so

914
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,240
what is asia's had at least nine months

915
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,960
off covet

916
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,960
okay i don't know whether we want to

917
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,720
take any more questions but we do

918
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,480
still have another few minutes otherwise

919
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,240
people can head off to morning too

920
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,600
early well on behalf of ulcert

921
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,039
thank you leon for your continued work

922
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:46,000

925
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,120
3 40 3 45 for the speed debate

926
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,640
and so make sure if you haven't been

927
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,399

928
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,840
actually contribute

929
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,799
