physically last year this time

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,040
i wasn't really sure this event was

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,479
going to happen

27
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,880
put all that work into my prezzo and

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,600

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,119
i was able to deliver it even from home

30
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,159
in september and kudos to the oscar

31
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,000
team for taking a physical event and

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,680
completely flipping it

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,000
and making it into a virtual event that

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,119
we had

35
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,240
but here we are this year with a hybrid

36
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,520
event uh and you know looking at the

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,520
numbers at the start of the week

38
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,119
uh you know we've got you guys in the

39
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,520
room but roughly 40 percent

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,799
of the attendees are joining us

41
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,680
virtually uh and that's really what i

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,280
want to talk about over the next

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,080
40 odd minutes or so is this idea of the

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,959
hybrid

45
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,280
workplace that it is truly hybrid this

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
is no longer about we're all going back

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,160
to work or

48
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,560
we're being remote it's really how do we

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,239
bring those two together

50
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,040
and what are the security implications

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,599
of that

52
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,760
happening now i joined cisco

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,080
coming on 20 years ago i got acquired

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
as part of a acquisition a small

55
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,640
australian startup called radiata

56
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,239
um we did uh wireless uh just to

57
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,400
put in context how old that was we were

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,080
doing 802.11a

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,840
of course the current standard is now

60
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,080
802.11ax

61
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,560
um but you know when we joined

62
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,440
um being the young ideological engineer

63
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,959
that i was at the time

64
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,360
i was really taken by our the company

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,000
vision

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,159
at the time right changing the way we

67
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,080
worked live play

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,599
and learn i thought that was pretty cool

69
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,280
we were in wireless that's what we were

70
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,159
doing

71
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,680
um and now you know fast forward to

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,519
where we are today got to give credit

73
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,560
where credit is due

74
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,720
covid19 also managed to change the way

75
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,840
we work

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,599
live play and learn and manage to do it

77
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,760
in less than six months

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,360
of course you know what does that tie

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
into that ties into

80
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,519
really our industry i.t as an enabler

81
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,080
i.t

82
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,360
being able to allow

83
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,280
for that business continuity nine in ten

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,319
australian companies took on new

85
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,440
technologies in order to have that

86
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,480
business

87
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,840
continuity allowing 3.2

88
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,120
million australian workers to continue

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,720
to work

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,959
and you know you look at where we are as

91
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,439
a country i think we're pretty lucky

92
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,120
here compared to other parts of the

93
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,920
world not just in terms of

94
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,959
the pandemic itself but from an economic

95
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,159
perspective uh as well

96
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,519
and one of the things you know it's not

97
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,760
like remote work was anything new

98
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,238
telecommuting was anything new one of

99
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,079
the you know interesting things that

100
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,600
changed was the mindset of business so

101
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,000
you know prior to last year there was a

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,160
perception that if we let people work

103
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,040
from home

104
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
that's going to be bad from productivity

105
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,160
right we don't know if anybody's

106
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,040
actually

107
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
doing work but last year actually was a

108
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,720
really good experiment and in fact 41

109
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,120
of australian companies found that the

110
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,160
opposite

111
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,120
was actually true they saw an increase

112
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,800
in productivity

113
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,240
now what's interesting when you look at

114
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,919
those companies

115
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,919
as distinct from those who just saw flat

116
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,240
productivity or even a decrease it was

117
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,639
not just the technology but the

118
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,960
processes and the policies they put in

119
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,759
place

120
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,199
to support it right and so that becomes

121
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,039
very important when we think about the

122
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,039
hybrid workplace

123
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,360
and what is going to need to be done

124
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,759
both from a technology but also a policy

125
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,600
place to allow that to work

126
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,240
because this is not about let's just do

127
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
remote access if people need to work

128
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,120
from home

129
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,280
this is about i need to have the exact

130
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,160
same quality of experience the same

131
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
capabilities

132
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,759
irrespective of whether i am in the

133
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,199
office or home

134
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,560
and i need to support that in a

135
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,600
seamless transition between those now

136
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,440
mckinsey did some interesting work um

137
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,199
over the past year really looking at the

138
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,960
nature of work and

139
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,759
trying to understand the applicability

140
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,240
of

141
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,280
remote work and in advanced economies

142
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,440
like ours what they found

143
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,479
was uh that basically uh 20 to 25

144
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,880
of workers across all different types of

145
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,479
verticals and environments

146
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,280
20 to 25 percent of the job functions

147
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,479
they could work

148
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,039
uh three to five days a week without

149
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,479
productivity

150
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,000
impact and that's you know your typical

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,520
computer-based uh

152
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,720
office work and you know case in point

153
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,919
uh to this you know change to hybrid

154
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,240
uh last week was the first time i

155
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,199
actually went

156
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,240
back into the office 14 months i have

157
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,639
not

158
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,639
um been in the office been working from

159
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,960
home uh and it wasn't just to go in for

160
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,560
the sake of of going in

161
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,240
uh the idea was we actually had a you

162
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,600
know the team was to get together we're

163
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,800
going to have a meeting physically in

164
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,080
the office

165
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,479
wake up that morning if you're from

166
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,240
sydney you'll remember we had

167
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,759
a torrential downpour that morning so

168
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,520
alarm goes off i'm thinking god i really

169
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,639
picked the wrong day

170
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,039
to go into the office and i wasn't the

171
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,120
only one that had that thought

172
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
because when we get to the office get to

173
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,759
the meeting about a third of the group

174
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,960
were joining over webex video and we had

175
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,199
a truly hybrid meeting exactly what we

176
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,000
are

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,199
are doing here today and so that

178
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,639
is really this point of supporting both

179
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,479
pieces now how do we do that

180
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,039
right in order to make that happen we've

181
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,800
got to be doing this

182
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
as a digital first motion what can be

183
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,880
delivered digitally must be delivered

184
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,080
digitally

185
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,560
and i make that point digital first

186
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,479
because often we talk about

187
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,680
cloud first a cloud for a strategy

188
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,599
and and to be clear that's really not

189
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,599
the strategy the strategy is digital

190
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,479
first

191
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,800
cloud first is how i'm going to

192
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,919
implement

193
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,520
that digital first strategy

194
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,639
and you know case in point on on this

195
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,080
is we need to allow things to work

196
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
wherever i am which means i have to

197
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,440
digitize it

198
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,800
so my wife is a sonographer so while

199
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
last year i was working from home the

200
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
kids were you know attending school from

201
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,680
home

202
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,440
she had to go into the office the way

203
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,280
ultrasound works you need a sonographer

204
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,120
you need an ultrasound machine

205
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,800
and you need a patient and they all need

206
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,560
to be physically in the same room

207
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,599
otherwise it really doesn't work

208
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:13,280
however the radiologist

209
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,960
he didn't come into the office for

210
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
months and months and months because

211
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
all of those scams got transmitted

212
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,319
digitally he was able to do

213
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,759
his work remotely and so we recognized

214
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,400
there is an

215
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,919
element in terms of job function so

216
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,639
last year obviously huge race around

217
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,519
this but it wasn't like it was brand new

218
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,479
most organizations already had a digital

219
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,399
transformation strategy in place we've

220
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,200
been talking about digital

221
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,320
transformation for

222
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,120
you know coming on a decade now what

223
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,279
changed was kind of the prioritization

224
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,920
and the acceleration and so you know saw

225
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,000
a huge amount of stats last year things

226
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
like you know what used to take

227
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,000
um you know a bunch of years we did in

228
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,360
in eight weeks

229
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,959
um but you know being security people as

230
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,640
we are in this room

231
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,800
we know what probably happened there

232
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,720
right you can do things fast you can do

233
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,399
them well you can do them secure

234
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,560
you're probably not going to do all

235
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,839
three and so

236
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,959
we did see a huge amount of acceleration

237
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,200
in that digital transformation there

238
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,320
things like what happened with

239
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,399
e-commerce with cloud

240
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,959
with the rise of video whether or not we

241
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,399
did things

242
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
really as we should or just did it quick

243
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,720
because everybody's working from home

244
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,680
that's what we need to be thinking about

245
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,560
now

246
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,760
we need to be refactoring what was what

247
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
was done and that's a lot of what you

248
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,839
know i've been doing with customers now

249
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,120
all right let's look at what we did

250
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,959
let's look at what we need to do

251
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,959
and you know do we need to kind of make

252
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,120
some changes along those lines because

253
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
it wasn't just

254
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,120
you know the business industry that was

255
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,880
in that acceleration phase

256
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,360
right it was the criminals as well

257
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,000
six-fold increase in cyber attacks

258
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,959
last year targeting this new attack

259
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,000
vector

260
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,120
of remote work right

261
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,320
which again comes down to what do we

262
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
need to be thinking about what new

263
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,839
attack vectors are we going to be

264
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,040
introducing

265
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,800
because it's now not just one or the

266
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,120
other it really is this hybrid approach

267
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,760
so what i'd like to look at is is really

268
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,360
these um

269
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,839
two different uh sorry three different

270
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,920
elements that we need to bring to bear

271
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,160
uh in order to deliver this right so we

272
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,839
obviously we need our secure remote

273
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,920
access right that's that remote work

274
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,240
piece in terms of the applications i'm

275
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,600
connecting to that's

276
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,120
access to the secure hybrid and the

277
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,440
multi-cloud but also i want to introduce

278
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,959
this idea of

279
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,519
the trusted workplace because again

280
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,800
there is this physical

281
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,360
element as well a couple different

282
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,079
things

283
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,120
fold into that one is uh what's

284
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,680
happening

285
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,160
from a really again this digitization

286
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,200
space

287
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,399
but in these employee safety parts so

288
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,760
doing a lot of work

289
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
with customers around how they're

290
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,959
starting to use location analytics

291
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,800
in order to do things like contact

292
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
tracing so if someone

293
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
is you know diagnosed with covid what

294
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,480
does that mean does everybody have to go

295
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,120
home

296
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,959
are there certain segments you know only

297
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,880
that area was impacted

298
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,920
that sort of idea also if people are

299
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,760
coming in and out not spending all the

300
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,240
time

301
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,600
what does that mean from a space

302
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
utilization perspective

303
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,279
do i need the whole big office that i

304
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,880
had before can i take a different

305
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,680
approach

306
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,760
and if people aren't always there how

307
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,079
does that tie into things like

308
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,480
building automation and what can i do to

309
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,399
make more effective use

310
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,480
of that office space energy and things

311
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,600
along those lines

312
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,959
on the other end of the spectrum is

313
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,360
the really the internet of things right

314
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,800
thinking of all the

315
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
devices that i have for work function

316
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,200
which now because of digitization

317
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
i actually need to have more connected

318
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,880
than maybe i did

319
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,720
in the past and what does that mean that

320
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,200
i i now need to do

321
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,680
so to address these there's three

322
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,320
different

323
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,160
security methodologies i want to i want

324
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,600
to talk about today

325
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,560
zero trust secure access service edge or

326
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,519
sassy

327
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,680
and micro segmentation all right looking

328
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,279
at how that's going to help us address

329
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:15,920
obviously

330
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,600
a whole range of things we can do in the

331
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,959
security space

332
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,040
what i'm suggesting is with these three

333
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,079
things if we focus

334
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,079
there that'll allow us to address what

335
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,279
we need to

336
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,240
so let's start with zero trust one of

337
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,120
the things i

338
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,800
always kind of thought was cool about

339
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,639
xero trust

340
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,839
this idea zero trust does not mean no

341
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,240
trust in fact the opposite is

342
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,360
fundamentally true

343
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,639
right i cannot implement a zero trust

344
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,079
methodology

345
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,920
if i do not have the ability to

346
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,000
establish trust

347
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
it's that ability to establish trust

348
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that's allowing me to do what what

349
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,839
i want to do here and let's be clear

350
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,480
zero trust is a fundamental change

351
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,880
in what we have traditionally done from

352
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,000
you know a secure

353
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,279
access approach right

354
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,040
typically what we're saying right trust

355
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,279
is established on access which of course

356
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,399
we no means well once i'm in i'm in i

357
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,200
get to play

358
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,360
with whatever i can touch from there but

359
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,800
the other piece is

360
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,079
trust is coupled to location

361
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,120
the location when i gain access the

362
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,079
challenge there

363
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,320
is you know in the in the world of

364
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
mobility that we have today what is

365
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,440
trust you know what does

366
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,000
location now mean what i where i

367
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
connected is not necessarily where i am

368
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,600
now as i progress

369
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,959
on the flip side right what i'm

370
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,360
connecting to virtual

371
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,160
services are created and destroyed on

372
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,839
the fly on demand

373
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,839
and then of course extending into this

374
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,079
idea of the hybrid workplace

375
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,240
so if i now look at what xero trust does

376
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,040
differently

377
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,000
i'm going to establish trust for every

378
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,199
request

379
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,440
and so what that means is i'm

380
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,600
establishing a security

381
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,399
perimeter every place that i am making

382
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,800
an access control decision

383
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,639
which has the byproduct now of helping

384
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,920
me decouple

385
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,480
this from location so now i'm better

386
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,920
able to handle things

387
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,760
as i cross these different domains now

388
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,760
zero trust needs to actually extend

389
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,959
beyond just the access

390
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,800
there's oftentimes people think zero

391
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,959
trust means multi-factor

392
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,639
authentication multi-vector

393
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,480
authentication is a part

394
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,839
of zero trust that's how i'm going to

395
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,560
establish trust

396
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,360
but after i establish trust i'm using

397
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,639
that now to define

398
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,440
policies which i need to enforce across

399
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,760
the network to the applications

400
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,839
and you know the idea of trust but

401
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,519
verify i need to be

402
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,560
constantly inspecting in order to ensure

403
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
that nothing has changed in that trust

404
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,720
relationship therefore needing to change

405
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,760
how i do the enforcement it's also

406
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,279
extending across

407
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,880
i.t in the sense that uh yes we've got

408
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,399
our typical user

409
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,639
devices again where we're doing that

410
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,560
multi-factor authentication so that is

411
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,240
my workforce

412
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,680
i'm talking about access not just to the

413
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,320
network but to the applications the work

414
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,199
loads

415
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,440
and then again on this iot space i've

416
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,760
got these non-user devices

417
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,600
i have to have a way of trusting them

418
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,120
for access to the network into the

419
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,240
applications

420
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,000
right that's my my work um my workplace

421
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,040
and so looking across these three and

422
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,759
now how

423
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,480
that's going to extend so i'm now

424
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,839
extending

425
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,320
to the apps to the cloud right so that's

426
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,000
our second piece which is secure

427
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,880
access service edge or sassy um sadly

428
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,320
it's kind of interesting in the sense

429
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,959
that

430
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,199
it didn't come out of you know industry

431
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,480
from vendors or

432
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,560
you know a research project at some

433
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,320
university like um for those of you who

434
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
were in the previous session that we saw

435
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,120
this actually came from an analyst it

436
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,399
came from gartner

437
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,480
and gartner was looking at the trends

438
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,680
that they were seeing

439
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,600
you know through their customers so on

440
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,759
the one hand you have the network side

441
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,639
and software defined wan on the other

442
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,000
side you had the security

443
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,800
groups and the idea of security as a

444
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,079
service

445
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,000
what they were looking at was bringing

446
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,759
those together

447
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,839
both from a consumption model as well as

448
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,279
a functionality

449
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,839
perspective and so that was this concept

450
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,279
of secure access

451
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,079
service edge or sassy so again how did

452
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:26,800
we kind of

453
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,759
get here where did it start so it really

454
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,839
started from the wan perspective

455
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,959
and really started from the location of

456
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,519
the apps the data center perspective

457
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,320
everything was connected to the data

458
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,839
center because that's where the apps

459
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,959
were the work

460
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,880
functions were all data center

461
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,800
applications right so you looked at the

462
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,720
traffic flows you know the majority of

463
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,079
all traffic went there and

464
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,680
ended there internet traffic was

465
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,320
in the minority and so whether i was in

466
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,519
you know the corporate headquarters

467
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,440
which maybe was where we co-located the

468
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,399
data center

469
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,119
or the branches or even remote

470
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,359
everything ultimately went there

471
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,959
and the advantage of that was since you

472
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,799
had to go there anyway now i can put my

473
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,439
security stack that becomes my perimeter

474
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,079
for that secure access of course that

475
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,240
really has not been the model for a very

476
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,359
long time

477
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,959
despite the fact that we've still kind

478
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,799
of maintained it

479
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,720
we're really in a you know internet

480
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,079
cloud-centric

481
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,960
sort of model that 80 20 has shifted

482
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,640
considerably

483
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,280
and so where things really started was

484
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,160
actually from

485
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
forget security this was a financial

486
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,520
decision right

487
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,840
i'm paying a lot of money for these mpls

488
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,559
links

489
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,120
in order to tunnel traffic to a data

490
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,240
center only

491
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,480
to have internet access so how do i look

492
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,919
at doing

493
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,320
some form of shift there have the

494
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,400
breakout to internet right so

495
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
that's where things started in the early

496
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,080
days you know concepts of intelligent

497
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,000
wan which was really looking at

498
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,080
intelligent path selection where do i

499
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,600
need to route the traffic

500
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,840
what sort interface but that has evolved

501
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,120
considerably

502
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,919
to the software-defined wam which is

503
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,240
looking beyond just that path selection

504
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,880
adding in

505
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,520
wan link redundancy and really getting

506
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,000
now a

507
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,919
focus on not just access to the wan but

508
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,919
servicing the applications how do i

509
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,160
ensure the quality of experience from

510
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,960
that perspective and optimize for that

511
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,440
the way we handle that more complex

512
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880
environment

513
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,919
is effectively the creation of a sd-wan

514
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,120
fabric

515
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,160
and what that is really buying me is

516
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,440
an automated a programmable type of

517
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,520
structure which gives me the flexibility

518
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,760
i need now that was the network guys

519
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,520
on the security side of the house the

520
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,440
problem was hold on all these guys now

521
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,400
are connecting

522
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,360
to internet based services we've got

523
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,320
shadow i t

524
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,080
and all the problems that came with that

525
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,480
and i've lost my security

526
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,160
stack in the data center as the

527
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,559
perimeter so what am i going to do there

528
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,640
so that's where we started to see this

529
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,840
idea of

530
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,679
security as a service giving these

531
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,000
secure access capabilities

532
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,080
once we started convincing the business

533
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,919
that hey you need to take this a little

534
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,240
bit

535
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,640
seriously then it started well how do i

536
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,120
get access to those securely

537
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,679
that's where now we brought in the xero

538
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,919
trust element people wanted a single

539
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,120
sign-on

540
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,600
and so that's kind of where that piece

541
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,400
evolved

542
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,480
and again gartner came and said let's

543
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,000
wrap this together

544
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,919
one from a consumption model but still

545
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,080
bringing in a bit of the cost aspect

546
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,320
but more importantly looking at how we

547
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,440
can get the

548
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,840
interaction between those two pieces and

549
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
that's kind of where the industry is

550
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,679
right now you've got a lot of evolution

551
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,840
that's happened on both the sd-wan and

552
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,600
the security as a service side

553
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,360
now the interesting work is how do we

554
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,640
bring those things

555
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,760
uh together now

556
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,600
again this is this is hybrid so we're

557
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,120
going to need to look at

558
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,520
the remote piece before we do one of the

559
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,600
the interesting things again is

560
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,679
where are the apps right and how is that

561
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,640
moving

562
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,320
so uh vmware obviously has a vested

563
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,200
interest

564
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
in this and they did some interesting

565
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,880
work last year

566
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,320
one they were just looking at you know

567
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
the state of the nation in terms of

568
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,000
cloud but also

569
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,520
from the perspective of what was the

570
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,120
impact of the pandemic

571
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,799
and some of the reprioritization have

572
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,520
been done and the interesting piece is

573
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,440
even though a number of activities got

574
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,360
accelerated at the end of the day

575
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,600
nearly half of companies have been

576
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,240
working on cloud migration for you know

577
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,440
three or more years

578
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,320
this is not some simple thing that we're

579
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,840
going to do it's not just well why can't

580
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,600
you take it off of one server and go

581
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,120
virtualize it and put it in the cloud it

582
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,159
doesn't quite

583
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,679
work that simply and so we're going to

584
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,000
have

585
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
for quite a while a large number of apps

586
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,600
that do

587
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,679
need to maintain you know within whether

588
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,799
it's the data center

589
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,679
a private cloud instance whatever uh has

590
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,679
been done and we look at

591
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,400
but what that implies is i am going to

592
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,799
need something like a vpn type

593
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,000
tunnel in order to get me that access

594
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,280
to that internal network i still will

595
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,320
have all my

596
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
sas based solutions my internet-based

597
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,120
solutions and there i can use the same

598
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,400
security as a service stack that we had

599
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,200
on the

600
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,080
sassy side and again that goes back to i

601
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,360
want to maintain

602
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,159
parity in this hybrid environment

603
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,840
irrespective of where i am and that's

604
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,360
one way that we do it

605
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,960
by using the same services irrespective

606
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,840
of the location the other piece here is

607
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,280
just like with the

608
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,080
early sd-wan days of the path selection

609
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,360
i want to do that

610
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,640
if i have to have vpn as well right just

611
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,320
because i need vpn doesn't mean now i

612
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,039
want to tunnel

613
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,760
all traffic into that vpn if i'm

614
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,840
accessing the sas based services

615
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,480
i want that intelligent path selection

616
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,400
to just go direct out

617
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,880
in fact you know looking at what what

618
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,159
cisco as an i.t

619
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,480
organization not cisco the vendor but

620
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,400
our internal it org

621
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,080
when we shifted uh to globally work from

622
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,120
home we shut down

623
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,400
every office globally in a matter of

624
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
weeks one of the first things

625
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,760
cisco it needed to do was

626
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,240
switch on split tunneling both whether

627
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,760
people are using the the anti-connect

628
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,120
soft client

629
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,480
and those people like me that actually

630
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,640
had the hardware cisco virtual office

631
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,520
router

632
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,200
because before they never bothered

633
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,799
putting that in place because well it

634
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,360
didn't

635
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,600
didn't matter now all of a sudden every

636
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,840
cisco employee was hammering that vpn

637
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,039
concentrator

638
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,720
they needed to make that change in order

639
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,960
to make it scale

640
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,840
so that takes us you know to the wan

641
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,880
piece the last

642
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,640
thing that we need to now be thinking

643
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,400
about is all right well

644
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,039
i've got the land to access the

645
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,240
applications

646
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,039
what about my actual internal network

647
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,080
itself my lan

648
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,320
environment and here's where you know

649
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,600
we're going to look at our third element

650
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,679
which is micro segmentation

651
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,080
now again i want to kind of start with

652
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,880
where we were

653
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,840
where some of us still are today right

654
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,480
network segmentation traditionally

655
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,520
was done you know really on a vlan

656
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,600
basis right so i started all i had was a

657
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,799
data network

658
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,960
20 years ago we started to see voice

659
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,919
over ip come in i needed a voice vlan

660
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,120
and really we didn't do that for

661
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
security we did that for quality of

662
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,159
service

663
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,120
15 years ago we started to see a lot of

664
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,120
wireless mobile devices now i need to

665
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,760
have

666
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,520
guest capabilities and so

667
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,480
all of these were really done from a

668
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,320
static acl

669
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,720
perspective given this is awesert i'm

670
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,799
sure all of you have your own

671
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,320
horror stories about massive acls

672
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,919
i work with bunch of customers they've

673
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,080
got you know thousands tens of thousands

674
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,120
of lines

675
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,640
of acls acls that they cannot touch

676
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,200
because absolutely no one remembers what

677
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,559
half of those lines

678
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,640
are for if they make changes if they

679
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,480
remove them what are they going to break

680
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,440
uh what holes are they going to open and

681
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,520
and really the challenge that we are

682
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,480
facing here is that we've got this

683
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,200
static

684
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,320
implementation of my security policy

685
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,440
which is coupled to my network topology

686
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,480
so every time now i go and add some new

687
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,279
service

688
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,679
i've got to make changes not just to my

689
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,200
network topology

690
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,440
but to my security policy as well

691
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,400
and of course it's not just within this

692
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,159
environment i now need to somehow

693
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,799
translate that policy

694
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,159
to my wan and into the cloud for the

695
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,360
for the apps and so this is kind of

696
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,480
where we are today we

697
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,559
put a lot of band-aids on this trying to

698
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,600
do things

699
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,240
you know we call it dynamic acls for

700
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,039
example

701
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,559
it's not really dynamic the only thing

702
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,039
that's dynamic is my decision point

703
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,559
as to which static set of acls

704
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,840
to apply the flexibility isn't there

705
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,919
which is why i'm stuck with more of a

706
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:08,960
macro

707
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,480
segmentation because i simply can't

708
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,240
do the implementation to get the

709
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,679
granularity

710
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,320
that i need so that takes us to kind of

711
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:18,960
where we

712
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,880
are starting to see today lots of

713
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,960
different terminology for the

714
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,559
point of our discussion day we'll just

715
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,039
call it a software defined perimeter

716
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,000
but the idea is i need to decouple my

717
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,279
security policy

718
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,880
from my network topology and what i'm

719
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,120
looking to make that happen

720
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,240
is actually a software-defined network

721
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,039
fabric right again lots of different

722
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,480
ways people are doing that but

723
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,440
ultimately i'm

724
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,919
after something programmable i'm after

725
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,440
automation

726
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,039
in my network configuration because

727
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,440
now what that's doing is allowing me to

728
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,880
decouple

729
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,679
that security policy from the network

730
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,200
policy in fact

731
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,080
what it's also doing is allowing me to

732
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,159
decouple security policy from my

733
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,240
security implementation

734
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,679
what do i mean by that well think back

735
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,279
to that big giant

736
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,559
list of you know the acls that was not

737
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:14,960
just

738
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,200
the security policy implementation that

739
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,640
was the policy

740
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,159
you might say well no no we've got a

741
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,400
whole document which is our our security

742
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,360
policy

743
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,640
which then gets what translated

744
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,559
manually into the acls

745
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,679
any translation error you know any human

746
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,880
input error

747
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,799
means that that is really what the

748
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,679
policy is so those acls

749
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,559
are the policy and then trying to take

750
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,279
that and

751
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,240
translate them across my domain so now

752
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,960
what i can do is i can abstract that

753
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,840
define my security policy with something

754
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,720
you know like a matrix type structure

755
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,520
the software-defined network fabric that

756
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,440
is what is responsible

757
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,880
for translating that to the

758
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,640
network policy the network

759
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,880
implementation all right and so

760
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,799
the other kind of nice benefit here is i

761
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,279
can now make it completely dynamic

762
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,159
and so i can do things like taking the

763
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,080
context into place

764
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,000
and not just change it on access but by

765
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,399
changing things on the fly

766
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,279
additionally because of this abstraction

767
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,120
that i've done from the policy to the

768
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,399
implementation

769
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,880
and because my network fabric is

770
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,440
effectively programmable with apis and

771
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,640
because my

772
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,679
software defined wan is a programmable

773
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,960
fabric with ac

774
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,520
apis because my cloud

775
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,600
implementations are programmable

776
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,960
with apis translating those security

777
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,080
policies between

778
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,120
these domains is now something that i

779
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,399
can do practically

780
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,399
right there is a path there is a vehicle

781
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,600
to make that

782
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,279
happen and so i am now doing

783
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,399
uh using my context and what do i want

784
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,799
to do now i want to effectively classify

785
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,880
and again lots of terminology

786
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,279
uh in use in the industry security group

787
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,679
security tags security labels

788
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,159
um you know all really trying to achieve

789
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,000
the same thing which is

790
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,399
let me classify who is coming into my

791
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,039
network

792
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,440
define policy on what can be done and

793
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,559
again i can now

794
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,000
add a bit more dynamic nature to this so

795
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,480
maybe you know my byod device when i'm

796
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,039
in the office i get full access

797
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,279
then you know when i'm remote i want to

798
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,679
change what i'm allowed to access

799
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,279
maybe um i haven't updated ios

800
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,320
on my phone and so i'm still got the

801
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,159
the webkit vulnerabilities from last

802
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,080
week so now i want to quarantine that

803
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,279
traffic

804
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,840
point is i can make those changes based

805
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,640
on

806
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,840
the context and again now that policy

807
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,919
ties in not just through the network but

808
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,159
across the lan into the cloud because

809
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,760
i've been able to translate those

810
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,720
policies

811
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,840
across the domains okay so

812
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,440
that's kind of looking at what we're

813
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,200
trying to do the last piece then you

814
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,240
know in terms of

815
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,080
this access part again comes back to

816
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,000
these iot devices these non-user

817
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,799
devices and really the challenge um that

818
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,559
we have here is

819
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,679
the capabilities are all over the shop

820
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,960
right i mean it really

821
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,159
could be anything from yep allows me to

822
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,399
put on search 2.1x2

823
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,760
absolutely nothing um as

824
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,919
recent as last year i was dealing with a

825
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:36,880
customer

826
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,960
um you know they had these wireless

827
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,159
voice over ip

828
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,799
handsets that was linked into the

829
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,320
business applications

830
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,159
they couldn't change and they only

831
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,440
supported wep

832
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,679
i'm like you know guys work with me here

833
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,520
at least a little bit

834
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,360
and so what do we do in that scenario

835
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,720
what have we done

836
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,919
in that scenario well we just use mac

837
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:58,320
off

838
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,799
bypass and we kind of cover our eyes and

839
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,159
lock down that vlan

840
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,200
and hope for the best all right so

841
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,679
with now the ability to implement micro

842
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,279
segmentation what are some things that i

843
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,320
might do differently

844
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
so device profiling that's nothing new

845
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
we've been doing it for a while

846
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,919
but now i want to use it for device

847
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,320
classification

848
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,039
all right and in doing so now i can

849
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,520
again do that grouping apply those tags

850
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,240
labels

851
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,360
whatever term you're going to use so as

852
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,960
an example

853
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,279
hospital brings in a brand new piece of

854
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,520
medical imaging equipment

855
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,799
right i profile it i recognize it as

856
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,440
medical imaging equipment i already have

857
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,679
a policy in place for what i do with

858
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,080
traffic from medical imaging

859
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,640
and now i just automatically apply it to

860
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,320
this new device that's been

861
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,480
introduced because remember when we talk

862
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,720
about hybrid workplace and making things

863
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,440
work irrespective of location that's not

864
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:55,840
just

865
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,120
for the business users that includes

866
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,279
the it organization as well we need to

867
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,320
be able to work

868
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
in this hybrid mode as well so anything

869
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,919
that i can do

870
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,000
at an automated way from a remote way

871
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,399
without needing to be physically on site

872
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,159
is equally important to making this

873
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,399
happen so

874
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,360
now let's kind of apply those zero trust

875
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,480
principles

876
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,559
so i've got my device you know it could

877
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,559
be a scanner a camera

878
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,519
we do the profiling so i've established

879
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,399
trust

880
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,600
based on how i'm able to do

881
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,840
uh the access control the sorry the

882
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,679
authentication onto the network

883
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,840
because again it's the business deciding

884
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,039
those products

885
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,840
um and sometimes they make bad decisions

886
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
without talking to us first

887
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,080
uh so based on that level of trust that

888
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,600
will decide you know what i'm looking to

889
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,480
do there

890
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,440
i'm then going to enforce the policy

891
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,320
because i've

892
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,039
classified it and then remember the

893
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,120
third part of xero trust is

894
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,240
inspect and there's been a huge amount

895
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,399
of really interesting work being done

896
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,559
around artificial intelligence machine

897
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:03,919
learning

898
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,080
and and that applies really nicely into

899
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,760
a scenario like this

900
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
because i can baseline the traffic from

901
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,880
those devices

902
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,600
now i can detect anomalies and recognize

903
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,240
hey

904
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,640
you know actually maybe it's not quite

905
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,399
what i thought it was you know what my

906
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,080
profiling told me

907
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,039
that it was and i can dynamically adjust

908
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,320
how i'm going to handle with that

909
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,000
traffic

910
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,080
so let's kind of take a step back and

911
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,440
now put all these pieces

912
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,480
together i've got my network fabric

913
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,760
which again is giving me that

914
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,480
programmability and the flexibility

915
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,519
i've got my zero trust elements

916
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,080
and that's linking into my ability to do

917
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,480
the micro segmentation

918
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,840
crossing over the lan with sassy into

919
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,000
the hybrid and the multi-cloud getting

920
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,480
those policies all applied

921
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,080
the last thing to think about here is

922
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,720
that network fabric actually gives me a

923
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,799
little bit more flexibility

924
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,240
than simply making you know a boolean

925
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,600
permit or deny decision that network

926
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,159
fabric

927
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,279
also allows me to change the traffic

928
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,080
flow

929
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,840
to look at where i'm sending that

930
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,519
traffic which i can use to

931
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,720
insert security services

932
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,039
so kind of taking some of the ideas and

933
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,559
concepts from that

934
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,360
sassy model of the blend of sd-wan and

935
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,039
security as a service

936
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,360
i'm trying to do that now within my

937
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,960
campus fabric

938
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,080
environment and so going back to that

939
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,640
medical imaging equipment example right

940
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,960
yes it's new yes i've discovered that it

941
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,600
looks like medical imaging equipment

942
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,159
but it is new i don't quite trust it yet

943
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,399
so now i have the ability to divert the

944
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,120
flow

945
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,200
get a bit of additional inspection on

946
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,480
there maybe sending it through

947
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,600
next-gen firewall and establish that

948
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,000
level

949
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,480
of of trust from a security organization

950
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,720
perspective maybe get to the point where

951
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
yes our machine learning has done the

952
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,760
baseline

953
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,600
and now we we have some level of

954
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,799
confidence if we do

955
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,760
profiling of new devices coming into the

956
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,519
network from that perspective

957
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,239
and again we can do this because i've

958
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:10,879
got that

959
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,520
software defined network fabric which is

960
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,399
giving me that

961
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,560
flexibility same thing that then i'm

962
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,800
taking into the sd-wan with the sd-wan

963
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,520
fabric

964
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,280
same thing that i'm looking to do in

965
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,918
fact all of the the data center guys

966
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,639
and the devops guys are doing uh in the

967
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,520
cloud space

968
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,800
both private and public cloud

969
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,599
so i've taken these three different

970
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,320
security

971
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,918
methodologies right zero trust sassy

972
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,960
micro segmentation and the idea here is

973
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,480
we've actually

974
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,760
taken them and used security as

975
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,280
an enabler and oftentimes security gets

976
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,960
accused of of hindering the business

977
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,280
you know when we look at what happened

978
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,760
uh last year with the need to

979
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,480
make things happen so quickly as we know

980
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,359
kind of

981
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,599
security sometimes took a bit of a

982
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,280
sideline

983
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
there because it really was about

984
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,800
getting the business

985
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,920
back up and running but here we're able

986
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,280
to make security as an

987
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,079
enabler to allow us to do what we need

988
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,839
to do to enable these different

989
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,200
areas of secure remote access secure

990
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,440
access to the hybrid and the multi-cloud

991
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,320
and now enable this idea of the trusted

992
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,440
workplace

993
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,359
and ultimately deliver on the secure

994
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,640
hybrid workplace and in doing so

995
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,560
maybe changing the way we work live play

996
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:45,839
and learn thank you very much

997
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,280
thank you very much mark um on behalf of

998
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,000
the conference just a small uh gift

999
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,320
oh very cool and at the moment i can't

1000
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,000
see any questions from our

1001
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,440
remote or local audience in here

1002
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,440
so obviously you've given them a very

1003
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,200
comprehensive view or you've completely

1004
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,599
bamboozled the audience

1005
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,400
do you have any uh comments on what

1006
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
potential gaps or

1007
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,119
future ideas you might have in the way

1008
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,320
that you're looking at this

1009
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,240
architectural approach

1010
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,720
potentially also in a multi-vendor

1011
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,240
environment as opposed to one where

1012
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,119
you've got

1013
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,880
the ability to interact and instrument

1014
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,960
every single network control

1015
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,359
access point well i guess that piece

1016
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,560
there um

1017
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,119
definitely goes through what we've done

1018
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,160
so i don't

1019
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,480
pretend in any way shape or form that

1020
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
that you know cisco addresses

1021
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,599
every element that that i discussed

1022
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,680
and very much looking at how do you take

1023
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,720
the multi-vendor

1024
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,440
pieces but what i would suggest is

1025
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,760
important

1026
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,720
is thinking about that programmable

1027
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,359
piece

1028
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,079
and what makes it work is how it all

1029
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,800
integrates so even in a multi-vendor

1030
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,760
environment we need to look at ways that

1031
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,599
it is able to stitch those together

1032
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,400
having

1033
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,079
you know one of those security elements

1034
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,400
that sits by itself

1035
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,800
really no longer addresses what we are

1036
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,599
trying

1037
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,240
uh to do so you know even in in the

1038
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,160
cisco sense where we don't um

1039
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
cover every single element we're

1040
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,800
typically looking at how do we integrate

1041
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,200
with third-party solutions to allow that

1042
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,480
continuity

1043
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,520
so we've got a couple of questions

1044
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,720
finally come oh now they're coming

1045
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,079
through now they're coming through

1046
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,920
um are we increasing the attack vector

1047
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,440
with this approach is

1048
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,680
if someone manages to change the tag

1049
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,960
then they can do whatever they want in

1050
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,400
the network and that's kind of my

1051
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,200
concern here with a kind of both with an

1052
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,359
identity sassy based control

1053
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,839
plus also just a network only component

1054
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:54,800
rather than something that goes all the

1055
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,560
way out to the endpoints

1056
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,880
and actually understands services no it

1057
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,040
is it is a fair point but i would argue

1058
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,119
some of that comes more to the

1059
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,440
implementation rather than the

1060
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,960
underlying technology

1061
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,400
approach and really i mean everything in

1062
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,560
security is always a balance

1063
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,480
and and hopefully what came across and

1064
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,079
the reason why i try to spend time

1065
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,119
looking at you know

1066
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,920
where we came from was where we came

1067
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,400
from

1068
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,440
is is simply unworkable i need

1069
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,240
more flexibility and 100 i need to make

1070
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,960
sure that

1071
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,359
introducing flexibility does not extend

1072
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,280
my attack surface and create more

1073
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,000
problems

1074
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,720
but by the same token the reality that

1075
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,480
we have here in this room today with

1076
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,160
people joining us remotely and people

1077
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,520
physically hear that is what it's going

1078
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,240
to be

1079
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,960
so the question is how do we address

1080
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,400
that reality

1081
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,480
so somebody else is asking uh could you

1082
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,640
give us a real world example

1083
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,760
a real world example um so

1084
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,800
i had already given the um example

1085
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,760
you know just from a work uh experience

1086
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,599
i would argue some of this is a real

1087
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,119
world example but that's more on the

1088
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,560
hybrid workplace suspect would mean a

1089
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,320
real world example in terms of

1090
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,560
taking these technologies uh and

1091
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,160
stitching them together

1092
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,599
so um look the real world example i'm

1093
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,480
going to give you is

1094
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,280
again that cisco it sense because this

1095
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,880
is what we had to

1096
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,680
uh implement and you may say oh with

1097
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,480
cisco it

1098
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,960
they've got easy access to all the cisco

1099
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,079
uh products

1100
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,200
um yes to some extent but they also do

1101
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,119
their due diligence just like every

1102
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,320
other it organization that they work

1103
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,160
they're also sometimes our worst

1104
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,240
customers because they always complain

1105
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,920
about things and think they should be

1106
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,520
able to get their changes

1107
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,440
put in place but that is exactly what

1108
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,200
cisco it

1109
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,680
um did from the pandemic and then really

1110
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,480
planning the

1111
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,359
return to work so we have gone

1112
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,440
completely

1113
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,640
duo for xero trust um you know granted

1114
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,400
that is a cisco

1115
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,680
acquisition um but that was already

1116
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,599
being put in place before the pandemic

1117
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,920
so we were already going down that path

1118
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,400
and in fact our remote work capabilities

1119
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,240
were already in place

1120
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,240
so one of the reasons why we were able

1121
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,000
to pivot so quickly

1122
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,599
was not because it was cisco i.t

1123
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,599
but because of the digital

1124
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,160
transformation work that had been done

1125
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,079
you know well before we were already

1126
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,599
moving in this

1127
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,079
in this direction and so same with the

1128
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,440
sd-wan ps

1129
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
the micro segmentation is probably the

1130
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,640
hardest

1131
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,599
bit and you know looking from a global

1132
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,040
company perspective

1133
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,280
at the moment the focus has really been

1134
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,079
on some of our

1135
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,119
development sites in china and india we

1136
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,720
haven't necessarily brought it to say

1137
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,200
the

1138
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,599
you know the sales office uh here in um

1139
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,359
in brisbane or down in sydney or

1140
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,720
melbourne

1141
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,560
so i'll make this one our last question

1142
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,319
for now one that i was already

1143
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,319
discussing with somebody else earlier

1144
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,240
today or last night it might have been

1145
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,000
it's uh the whole concept of

1146
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,240
automating mistakes scale how do you

1147
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,160
avoid human error in

1148
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,480
increasing your automation and some of

1149
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,920
the discussion i was having yesterday

1150
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,280
around this was the whole concept of

1151
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,680
well

1152
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,359
you've got to automate everything but do

1153
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,960
you have multiple teams or different

1154
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
automation groups to actually

1155
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,720
still have some sort of overlapping

1156
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,400
control rather than it be i've made the

1157
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,680
mistake here that the same space

1158
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,720
goes back to what i said before about

1159
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,040
what we had before was simply untenable

1160
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,760
so

1161
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,520
um you guys are asking for real world

1162
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,200
examples to give a real world example we

1163
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,240
had um

1164
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,880
working with a a manufacturing site in

1165
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,400
china

1166
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,560
and the the old way of doing things with

1167
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,560
that coupling of security policy and

1168
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,240
network topology

1169
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,200
had two challenges one every change was

1170
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,000
really

1171
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,560
manual and therefore resource intensive

1172
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,960
and also to your point introduced

1173
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,000
mistakes um the the ot

1174
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,920
side of the house that was driving the

1175
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,200
requirements

1176
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,119
um you know they were focused constantly

1177
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,640
on we need to be able to make changes

1178
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,240
quickly quickly quickly they had new

1179
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,800
things they wanted to do every week

1180
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,839
and it simply could not keep up so

1181
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,560
automation was just fundamentally

1182
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,680
necessary

1183
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,839
but what was interesting is yes mistakes

1184
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,760
do have a chance to propagate

1185
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,280
but the risk of those mistakes decreases

1186
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,800
dramatically because now it's not so

1187
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,880
manual intensive it's not coming down to

1188
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,839
a line of acl but rather a simple

1189
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:33,359
policy based design designing my intent

1190
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,480
which then gets implemented by the

1191
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,440
controller

1192
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,680
you always want to have multiple levels

1193
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,599
so that if there is an error how do i

1194
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,640
detect that

1195
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
so then i can go and make the change but

1196
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,960
i i just i would fundamentally argue

1197
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,839
that

1198
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,680
the risk is too high to go there i would

1199
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,960
argue there is no choice

1200
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,880
we must therefore let's figure out the

1201
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,160
policies

1202
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,119
and approach in order to prevent the

1203
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,560
issues from coming up so at the end of

1204
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,240
the day this is one half of the solution

1205
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,040
you've still got to have your

1206
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,960
comprehensive logging and

1207
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,280
response capability to pick up on both

1208
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,040
human errors and malicious activities

1209
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,800
as i said these three areas i'm saying

1210
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,400
what we need to do in order to put this

1211
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,119
in place that is not where we stop

1212
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,960
fantastic well thank you very much

1213
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,720
that's been a great and very informative

1214
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,440
talk

1215
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,200
um thank you all very much next talk in

1216
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,319
here will be starting in a couple of

1217
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,520
minutes and

1218
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,520
if you have a conference a ticket to the

1219
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,960
conference dinner tonight but no longer

1220
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,520
needed

1221
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,440
just let the registration desk out the

1222
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,640
front no because there's a wait list

1223
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,830
[Applause]

1224
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,560
cheers
