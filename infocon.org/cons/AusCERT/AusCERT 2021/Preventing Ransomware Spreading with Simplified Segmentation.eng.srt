1
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,760
so for everyone in the room there's a

2
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,200
technical glitch apparently on the

3
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
streaming side of things that they're

4
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,599
trying to sort out

5
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,959
and we'll kick off as soon as i get to

6
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,280
go ahead for that so just a couple more

7
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:37,840
minutes thanks

8
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,879
great okay well welcome back from after

9
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,000
lunch everyone

10
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,680
um we're going to kick this one off very

11
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,120
rapidly since we've already lost some

12
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,560
time and i don't want to block andrew

13
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,760
for more talking

14
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
uh very quickly quick housekeeping we're

15
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,799
using the app

16
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,159
for questions you've probably all heard

17
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,680
this a thousand times by now but please

18
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,200
use the app i'll be moderating if

19
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,560
there's any questions to butt in

20
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
i'll do so so without further ado here's

21
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,639
andrew k to talk about

22
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,639
something really nice and simplified

23
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,478
segmentation and preventing ransomware

24
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,000
with it rather than being complex

25
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
thanks andrew yeah thanks very much and

26
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,199
thanks everyone for joining

27
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,720
live and obviously those that are on the

28
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
stream it's really i'm really excited to

29
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,919
have a conversation today

30
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,560
around stopping the crippling result of

31
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,080
some of the breaches and often that we

32
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,520
see through ransomware with

33
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,199
with this concept of segmentation or

34
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,520
end-to-end segmentation

35
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,360
i'm really proud to represent illumio so

36
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,199
um i'm help we're helping organizations

37
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,479
you're going to go through this process

38
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,040
of

39
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,520
avoiding you know the really heavy costs

40
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,800
i guess if you like of cyber crime

41
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,520
breaches and

42
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,280
we've got a booth out there in the in

43
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,880
the uh in the expo space so

44
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,000
come along afterwards if you've got

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,840
particular questions and have a chat

46
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,160
so i think it's pretty pretty undeniable

47
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
these days that ransomware is

48
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,280
has become a really big money maker in

49
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,720
cyber crime right and

50
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,960
with the availability of it as platforms

51
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,759
as a service

52
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,039
you know the complications that we've

53
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,880
all had of remote workforces you know

54
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,080
the continuation of

55
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,759
you know covered conditions and one over

56
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,360
the last 12 18 months

57
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,880
it's been had a great opportunity to do

58
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,039
a lot of damage and

59
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,840
however basically any kind of lateral

60
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,800
movement

61
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,520
within an environment for whichever

62
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,199
nefarious purpose it might be

63
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,880
is something that's you know concerning

64
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,240
security teams

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,000
and it's where adversaries are getting

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,400
really good at leveraging and exploiting

67
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
elements of implicit trust within that

68
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,600
environment

69
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,960
so i think interestingly a lot of the

70
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,000
time when we're thinking about

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,440
ransomware we immediately think of

72
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,880
you know the payments of ransoms and

73
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,560
what that might mean for organizations

74
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,039
but

75
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,639
a lot of time it's often that the

76
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,080
downtime and the

77
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,639
the operational business effects of that

78
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,400
type of event

79
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,160
that actually outweighs the cost of that

80
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,479
actual you know payment that may be made

81
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,840
or the financial penalties that might

82
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
come from that

83
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,080
and when you know bad guys or whoever

84
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,600
they might be kind of break into a

85
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,319
network

86
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,880
they're often able with kind of unfitted

87
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,840
access

88
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,240
to critical data that you likely have

89
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,400
within that environment

90
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,720
uh and it's all really too real at the

91
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,080
moment that a breach could actually kind

92
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,639
of really

93
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,280
 the business that you're in so

94
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,800
we're going to look at a way

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,479
of kind of approaching this in perhaps a

96
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,319
slightly different manner

97
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,600
not reactive but proactive and try and

98
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,360
simplify this as much as we can so we

99
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,280
can make the you know the largest gain

100
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,440
in helping prevent this from happening

101
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,919
i think nowadays as we said it takes

102
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,600
more consideration now than ever i think

103
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:37,919
we're

104
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,479
where enterprises are increasingly more

105
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,759
and more connected

106
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,639
employees more and more remote endpoints

107
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,840
talking back to the rest of the

108
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,160
enterprise through the campus networks

109
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,560
in reality you know the breaches that we

110
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,400
hear of and we we had one in the last

111
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,560
week in the us around you know pipelines

112
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,440
and gas

113
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,199
availability and in the colonial

114
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,280
environment these damaging breaches

115
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
these days they don't start

116
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,720
and end with an attacker you know

117
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,800
accessing directly the system of value

118
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,199
or you know locking or crypto locking a

119
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,960
system that is controlling everything

120
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,160
within an enterprise

121
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,720
they tend to originate from an entry

122
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,080
point of weakness

123
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,800
you know maybe considered lower risk or

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
by nature has a you know a lower

125
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,840
security posture

126
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,000
maybe devices you know iot through

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,360
supply chain that i know there are other

128
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,160
talks on

129
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,880
and also around that trusted employee

130
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,400
endpoints

131
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,240
and and basically the idea is that that

132
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,759
lateral movement once they're in the

133
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,720
environment

134
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
is that opportunity to then either

135
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
crypto lock and take over systems

136
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,960
or eventually find their way to that

137
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
system of value and exfiltrate data and

138
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,720
monetize it through that particular

139
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,199
mechanism

140
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,919
and so inevitably you know a breach is

141
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,160
kind of bound to occur

142
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,319
not because you don't have the latest

143
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,160
you know threat detection or securities

144
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,639
in place

145
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,240
you know the classic kind of security

146
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,080
infrastructure that we've all come to

147
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,000
to have built out over the last you know

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,280
decade or so

149
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,960
but because you know the ever evolving

150
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,560
kind of crime landscape it means that

151
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,400
they're attack vectors they're always

152
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,919
increasing always evolving as

153
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,919
well and it boils often boils down to

154
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,639
the fact that we're always human as well

155
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,720
so very quickly from that kind of single

156
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,319
entry point

157
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,560
a malware breach can then really

158
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,479
effectively and really quickly and this

159
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,680
is really one of the real important

160
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,240
parts

161
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,960
really quickly find its way across to

162
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,560
those critical systems

163
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
and the reality is that the more things

164
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,599
that we have connected

165
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,200
the less we know about all of those

166
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,279
systems the more likely they're all

167
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,719
talking to each other and connected in

168
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,479
ways that we're not aware of

169
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,880
the more risk that we actually have and

170
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,000
the result being that if

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
we are under one of these events and

172
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,120
hopefully

173
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,040
you haven't experienced one or you won't

174
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,480
experience one again

175
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
is that they do end up become very

176
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,519
crippling when that when that particular

177
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,920
event actually happens

178
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,279
and so yeah just coming back to that

179
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,720
we've all seen headlines i'm not going

180
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,959
to you know go on this too much but

181
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,959
whether it's you know going back to the

182
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,560
early days if you like

183
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,480
you know wannacry not picture and the

184
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
variations that we've seen more and more

185
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,040
recently we've seen that one of the

186
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
really key aspects of this is the speed

187
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,080
in which this can

188
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,560
move and the prevalence in which it

189
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,279
moves

190
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,959
laterally you know whether it's seconds

191
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,600
or a few minutes to take down global

192
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,920
banks or to take down infrastructure at

193
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,519
logistics companies

194
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,320
distribution networks utilities and

195
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,000
critical infrastructure within a

196
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,399
particular nation

197
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,959
the wiper malware or the ransomware all

198
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,160
they really need is

199
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,519
time and so needless to say kind of time

200
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,080
is of

201
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,200
that essence and and pressure really is

202
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,600
on

203
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
kind of existing security tools to to

204
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,160
kind of either never miss detecting it

205
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,399
or not being delayed in that detection

206
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,399
and response

207
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,480
and that's where the real challenge kind

208
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,800
of lies

209
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,760
and so that's what i'm going to talk a

210
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,519
little bit about today and kind of see

211
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,480
well

212
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,240
what is that attack surface really look

213
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,160
like and what can we possibly do about

214
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,680
it to simplify that

215
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,279
and get out in front of some of this so

216
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,519
we're not chasing those zero days

217
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,200
so let's take a quick look at you know

218
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
attack surface common to most

219
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,519
organizations

220
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,959
i would say out there with you guys

221
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,720
we've got client devices

222
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
you know in uh you know the employees

223
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,399
and how we you know do our daily jobs as

224
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,360
a as as personnel and then data center

225
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,279
and whether the data centers on premise

226
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,120
or in the cloud or hybrid or

227
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
multi-cloud or a mixture of which

228
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,480
there's often a lot of applications that

229
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
are running in those areas

230
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,079
in you know server farms that we're

231
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,600
managing across the estate

232
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
and to begin with many organizations

233
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,399
going to start with a process of

234
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,120
building out

235
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,200
you know a mechanism of detecting

236
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,279
objects that are on the network

237
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,800
and then deciding whether or not they

238
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,320
should or shouldn't be on the network

239
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,160
so we have solutions like knack or

240
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,399
networks acquisitions control that

241
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,040
they gatekeep whether or not an object

242
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,160
should be there

243
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,279
but they tend to stop at that point

244
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,399
yeah a posture check is made and you are

245
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,399
identified as a correctly corporate

246
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,000
issued device that should be there and

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,040
and therefore you're allowed on the

248
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,959
network and typically you're placed in

249
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,720
an environment that alongside all the

250
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,519
other clients

251
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,440
that are in that same posture position

252
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,279
so rather than extending that knack to

253
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,560
actually what you're allowed to do when

254
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,839
you're on the network

255
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,680
you're basically relying on that

256
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,519
implicit trust of the device

257
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,360
that's been profiled the operator of

258
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,640
that device

259
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,320
or that shared environment that's being

260
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
used and that's where the

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,160
you know the exploit often starts and

262
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,600
whether it's a fish or a social

263
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,440
engineering attack or whatever it might

264
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,160
be

265
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,360
that first device more than likely

266
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,040
being used at home during covert and

267
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,800
being brought back into the office

268
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,279
uh and uh and get back onto the systems

269
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,399
it's more than likely that's where a

270
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,959
compromise is gonna get started

271
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,399
and unfortunately as we're talking about

272
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,880
that time mechanism this new strain of

273
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,000
this new thing that

274
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,560
you know is slightly masking itself from

275
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,320
signature detection based endpoint

276
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,600
protection products

277
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,040
means that it's going to be able to beat

278
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,760
that immediate identification of it

279
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,720
being a bad

280
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,360
thing and so those endpoint products

281
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,560
tend to revert to

282
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,600
behavioral analysis looking for

283
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,920
you know activity over a period of time

284
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,440
that would indicate that a compromise

285
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,880
has occurred

286
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,160
and then they would go through that

287
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,639
process of you know responding detecting

288
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,560
and responding to that

289
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
on that first machine that was being

290
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,320
affected

291
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,240
now unfortunately that the malware

292
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,000
delivery systems that they're all using

293
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,160
and ransomware uses delivery mechanisms

294
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,560
to

295
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,120
move their way around they make the best

296
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
use of this time

297
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,800
and their goal is obviously to spread

298
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,560
far and wide

299
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,800
and unfortunately with most standard

300
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,079
kind of operating systems windows that

301
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,519
we're running in the client world

302
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,320
there is a lot of opportunity to do so

303
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,959
potentially

304
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,959
many ports left open on these devices

305
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,240
that we're running due to the nature of

306
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,560
how

307
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,720
you know they sell operating systems and

308
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,079
so that adjacency

309
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,600
and the systems that are running inside

310
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,920
that environment are going to be able to

311
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,680
be accessed typically

312
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,440
through that you know that trust that

313
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,720
you're on the network and you're only

314
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,519
going to be

315
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,079
operating the way you should and so

316
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,040
those

317
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,399
endpoints are then reached and then

318
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,079
infected and the

319
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,200
the event kind of spreads and continues

320
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,959
we cross over to the data center side

321
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,639
and typically in the past we focused a

322
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,920
lot on kind of perimeter

323
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
defense and keeping the bad guys out i

324
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,279
think that's a well-known concept that's

325
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,120
kind of been debunked recently but

326
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,120
unfortunately we still tend to be in a

327
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,320
position of

328
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,079
internal zonal type firewalling

329
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,399
or that impression that if our compute

330
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,480
is in a particular internal area

331
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,880
then again uh that we're not they're not

332
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,920
going to necessarily be able to

333
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,079
break that trusted perimeter boundary to

334
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,079
make their way through

335
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,920
and if we've got internal devices coming

336
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,839
through vpns or in internal office

337
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,440
networks and their trusted employees

338
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,399
doing work

339
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,639
then again we're relying on that nature

340
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,160
of trust

341
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,959
um and the flat network perhaps that we

342
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,720
have running inside that data center or

343
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,399
across multiple data centers

344
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,160
or if we've got applications sprawling

345
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,920
across clouds or multi-cloud

346
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,440
and we don't really fully understand all

347
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,199
that connectivity there's

348
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,199
often a lot of opportunity for that

349
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,199
lateral movement to continue

350
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,560
and particularly continue when you've

351
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,160
got you know all of our servers in a

352
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,360
particular server vlan

353
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,959
or even just the web servers or the

354
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,399
databases in their own vlan

355
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,079
there's a lot of opportunity for lateral

356
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,440
movement

357
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,639
and again that ability to exploit

358
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,800
that element of trust that servers will

359
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,160
only behave and communicate on what

360
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,320
they're supposed to do

361
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,600
and i guess i'll throw it in there at

362
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,279
the end there uh really important

363
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,880
security technologies that we

364
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,040
hopefully all have and working on

365
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,279
basically with sock or seam or

366
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,680
ueba or behavioral analytics really

367
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,079
important parts of that platform but

368
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,079
again they're typically still reacting

369
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,440
or reporting what

370
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,959
has happened um still challenged to get

371
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,639
out in front of this actual problem

372
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,639
and they're not easy things to do and to

373
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,079
continue to do on and particularly the

374
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,519
scale that our enterprises are now

375
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,040
operating at

376
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,480
so i'm not going to ban on too much

377
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,760
about zero trust it's obviously a very

378
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,800
buzzwordy word and

379
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,079
from a vendor lab perspective we

380
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,600
probably all say it right but but

381
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,199
ultimately i think that the key thing

382
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,000
with that

383
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,480
we've kind of attached to here is that

384
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,680
if we can

385
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,920
identify and control lateral movement

386
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,519
within our environment

387
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,519
we're going to be able to limit the

388
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,959
reach

389
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,199
and if we can limit the reach of the

390
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,320
movement

391
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,600
then we're going to be we're going to

392
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,839
help stop being crippled by that breach

393
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,560
because we're going to be able to

394
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,680
contain it

395
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,959
to a known area and reduce the number of

396
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,440
systems that can be affected by this

397
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,279
so through segmentation and that's what

398
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,320
we're going to start talking about more

399
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,199
today

400
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,360
we can kind of rather than frantically

401
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,959
you know pull the plug and shut down

402
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,720
systems you know in advance of

403
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,240
the wave of infection that might be

404
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,600
happening during one of these you know

405
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,120
crypto lock attacks

406
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,800
or you know perhaps inevitably having to

407
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,240
pay that high ransom

408
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,000
to you know to get access back or to

409
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,680
reissue a whole bunch of devices and

410
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,519
reboot from those backup plans that

411
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,880
you're hoping are going to really work

412
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,839
well or your analysts having a chance to

413
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,360
react from the sock

414
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,440
you know if we can get a proactive

415
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,720
approach

416
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,959
that would prevent the spread of the

417
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,240
infection

418
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,480
not necessarily prevent every possible

419
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,720
infection opportunity but prevent the

420
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,320
spread of it

421
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,279
whether it's between our you endpoints

422
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,440
between the application servers that we

423
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,839
run

424
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,199
or between the endpoints and the

425
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,600
applications then we're going to

426
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,320
really you know make a complementary

427
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,480
addition to our security portfolio

428
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,320
which has been particularly effective in

429
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,600
you know limiting

430
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,120
you know ransomware and cyber crime

431
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,800
across our enterprises so that's kind of

432
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,360
the real

433
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,600
important part of this and we've done uh

434
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,759
and well actually bishop fox was a

435
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,360
particularly leading red team specialist

436
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,120
firm and and they were engaged to kind

437
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,959
of test and measure the efficacy of

438
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,000
segmentation and

439
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,079
and oftentimes security is all about

440
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,360
risk buy down or

441
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,920
an insurance policy versus actual

442
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,880
measurable

443
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,040
you know reduction or benefit and so

444
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,399
they looked at this and we did an

445
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,519
exercise and

446
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,480
and they were you know we allowed them

447
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,760
to be a capable and tenacious adversary

448
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
trying to get access to you know trophy

449
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,280
assets or crown jewels

450
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,880
in a similar way that ransomware would

451
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,720
spread or another kind of any

452
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,439
kind of attack breach would happen and

453
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,359
it clearly demonstrated that

454
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,319
if you do segment or compartmentalize or

455
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,319
isolate systems within your environment

456
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,400
then it gets significantly more

457
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,160
difficult for an attacker to reach that

458
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,120
goal

459
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,280
you know even if they're you know gamed

460
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,559
in their favor to actually

461
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,559
be able to do it it forces them to

462
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,320
change tactics

463
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,480
and if it's done really really well then

464
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,840
it also produces a

465
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,960
vast number of indicators of where this

466
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,600
is actually

467
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,480
happening all right so even if we do

468
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,039
have to do some level of reaction

469
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,799
we're getting a lot more information out

470
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,160
of the environment that it is actually

471
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,679
happening

472
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,799
so the low end slows perhaps become a

473
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,440
lot more

474
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
prevalent and a lot more forefront for

475
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,720
us

476
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,840
so let's take a look at that same

477
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,600
scenario again let's take the the

478
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,200
initial kind of breach pattern away from

479
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,679
that

480
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,760
and let's look at that through a lens of

481
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,720
kind of adding

482
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,799
segmentation or adding a zero trust

483
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,799
network in play

484
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,640
and ultimately that you know the same

485
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
authorization is going to occur through

486
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,360
the next solution a really important

487
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,320
part of that

488
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,679
um but un unlike the initial mechanism

489
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,200
which relied on

490
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,679
or the time factor taken by the endpoint

491
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,360
products

492
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
to detect and respond we're going to put

493
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,440
a proactive fence on every one of those

494
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,039
client objects to say i'm not going to

495
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,919
receive

496
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,640
inbound communication from other clients

497
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,080
okay

498
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,720
why would i need smb traffic from laptop

499
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,440
to laptop or wmi or ftp servers running

500
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,160
on you know

501
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,160
employees machines i can identify and

502
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,320
allow only the ones that are appropriate

503
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,679
like peer-to-peer traffic you know all

504
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,240
the

505
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,919
zoom sessions we do or the microsoft

506
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,679
teams or or even you know

507
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,840
windows updates from the it team but

508
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,280
that's pretty much all that needs to be

509
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,640
received inbound from a client

510
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,080
perspective

511
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,760
so if we can block all of that client

512
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,400
inbound then we're going to

513
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,480
basically have the first compromise

514
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,760
machine

515
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,440
is going to become the last compromise

516
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,400
machine because it's not going to be

517
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,679
able to pass it on

518
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,039
or it's going to be significantly harder

519
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,000
for it to be passed on

520
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,240
using least privileged principle in the

521
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,039
data center then what we're going to do

522
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,240
is we're only going to expose

523
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,080
the application interfaces that are

524
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,400
required for our devices or our clients

525
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,640
or our consumers to operate with

526
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,480
we're going to keep the back end

527
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,840
environment away from that we don't have

528
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,039
to build our complicated

529
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,799
double firewall dmz's and worry about

530
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,240
all that stuff we're going to do this on

531
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,799
an object by object basis

532
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,440
okay we're going to isolate the servers

533
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,960
or the infrastructure that runs our

534
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,120
business applications from each other

535
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,360
you know regardless of the vlan

536
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,799
structure the subnet whether they're

537
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,919
running in the cloud whether it's

538
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,280
running on premise

539
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,880
you know or across multi-cloud we're

540
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,240
going to we want to do this in a way

541
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,480
that says logically these systems

542
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,559
represent business services and they

543
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,600
don't need

544
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,760
connectivity to anything else simply

545
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,840
because of the location or the con

546
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,880
the context of where they run

547
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,720
okay so whether you're you know focused

548
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
on you know uptime or availability or

549
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,880
you have a security responsibility

550
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,159
there's got to be a better way than you

551
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,919
know shutting down systems or relying on

552
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:20,880
the backup and stuff

553
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,640
so if we can do this we're going to

554
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,919
allow the

555
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,000
reduce the attack surface down to the

556
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
minimal exposed interface point

557
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,559
we can hopefully do that down to very

558
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,559
minimal interface you know individual

559
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,880
port protocol type combinations it's a

560
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,320
very granular control over the access

561
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,559
and ideally from client to applications

562
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,240
we can also ensure

563
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,120
that only the you know respective roles

564
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,080
the people that are using those devices

565
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,919
the active directory group that they're

566
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,080
in perhaps within their organization

567
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,679
would determine which systems they

568
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,000
should be able to access as well

569
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,640
so kind of from an end-to-end picture

570
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,120
segmenting clients from clients

571
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,840
data center services from each other and

572
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,440
then providing

573
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,520
you know role-based access to those

574
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
application services on the minimal

575
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,679
front end

576
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,080
now you might say well isn't this

577
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,600
principle of segmentation there's

578
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,200
nothing new right this is just

579
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,679
network segmentation can we not just put

580
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,120
these objects in the right

581
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,760
vlan or the right area it's been around

582
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,320
a while

583
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,000
how are we not managing to do this are

584
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,159
we not doing this already

585
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,760
and ultimately i think from a networking

586
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,000
perspective we build vlans and stuff to

587
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,919
to avoid you know collisions and

588
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,840
broadcast traffic collision domains

589
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,240
they they started to creep in to a

590
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,080
security lens of the world because maybe

591
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,360
that was an opportunity

592
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,240
to reduce you know a scope of of traffic

593
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,520
within an environment

594
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,440
but when we're talking about you know

595
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,960
services that could be

596
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,240
sprawled across country across clouds

597
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,559
uh many many thousands of servers in a

598
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,600
lot of cases

599
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,240
it gets really challenging to do this

600
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,799
from a

601
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,159
networking perspective or the

602
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,280
traditional tools that we've been using

603
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,480
so let's just have a quick look at that

604
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,600
and then we'll look at how we can do

605
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,559
segmentation

606
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,600
in a much more simplified and objective

607
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,760
manner

608
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,400
so in the endpoint space it's quite very

609
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
different from the data center right you

610
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,120
know traditionally in the end point

611
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,760
we've been

612
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,320
you know focused on preventing an object

613
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,559
from either being on the network at all

614
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,559
uh or detecting inbound threats

615
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,799
typically you know from the internet

616
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,559
looking at memory and executable

617
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,000
programs you know

618
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,679
file hashes disk behavior and so forth

619
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,440
and so they tend to become you know very

620
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,720
internally focused

621
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,880
point in time detection you know a

622
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,320
database lookup of bad

623
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,120
known signatures or resulting as we said

624
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,039
into kind of behavioral analysis waiting

625
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:47,600
for

626
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,960
something or a set of things that are

627
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,240
going to happen that would identify a

628
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,960
threat

629
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,559
and that that time window as we talked

630
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,240
about that reaction

631
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,120
is not really at the scale or the the

632
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,200
factor in which this stuff is moving

633
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,760
and how fast it can really spread so the

634
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,679
attackers are going to exploit that

635
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,240
dedicated delivery mechanisms achieving

636
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,120
the goals before you

637
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,720
move on before the they've actually been

638
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,320
detected

639
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,159
as we've talked about now we typically

640
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,440
use that as a gatekeeper

641
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
you know profiling what shouldn't

642
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,480
shouldn't be there uh

643
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,080
if the posture changes of that

644
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,600
particular device then have to be told

645
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
about that to treat it difficultly

646
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,039
typically like i said it's admission but

647
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,360
it's not really granular control

648
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,720
once you're present okay and

649
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,440
and if anybody's out there thinking well

650
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,400
i just do you know

651
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,840
endpoint firewalling for example with

652
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,600
gpos and managing it that way

653
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,360
you know if anybody's managed that stuff

654
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,240
it's it's often good when you have

655
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,799
one policy that you want to apply to

656
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,919
everybody

657
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,760
but the complexity the frustration of

658
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,600
kind of getting anything meaningful

659
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,360
out of a targeted policy for different

660
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,880
employee types or different endpoint

661
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,840
types

662
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,240
at scale you don't often know how long

663
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,360
the rules are going to take to be

664
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,279
applied by that gpo

665
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,880
you don't really get feedback loop as to

666
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,240
whether they were applied and whether

667
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,760
they're in action whether they succeeded

668
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,559
or not

669
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,320
so all of these kind of technologies are

670
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,840
really important but they're not really

671
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,360
focused on helping

672
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,039
contain the network connectivity profile

673
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,400
of that particular device

674
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,000
and so what we're going to do is we're

675
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
going to introduce a really simple

676
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,960
way that would complement this

677
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,600
complement that complement endpoint

678
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,720
focus on a containment by default

679
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,919
strategy and that's going to

680
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,039
as we said prevent primarily you know

681
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,720
inbound connectivity into endpoint

682
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,600
devices

683
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,919
we'll talk about the the the outbound to

684
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,279
applications later on but

685
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,880
if we can prevent that then the

686
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,120
opportunity to move

687
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,240
is going to be eliminated you plan

688
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,159
beyond the first laptop getting infected

689
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:48,880
but

690
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,279
the first one you know being the last

691
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,600
one to be infected

692
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
okay if we take a look at the data

693
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,640
center what we

694
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,320
what we typically hear from customers is

695
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,640
not that they don't want to achieve

696
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,520
you know a zero trust network or very

697
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,679
granular control within that environment

698
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,279
they're looking to achieve that

699
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,600
separation of systems within the

700
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,000
within their data centers but it's

701
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,480
really difficult to actually get there

702
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,799
and and typically they're getting the

703
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,240
thought around that is to get there

704
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,919
through traditional mechanisms that

705
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,679
we've used to control

706
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,679
traffic on a network and those

707
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,600
traditional mechanisms are

708
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,320
you know fire network switches acls on

709
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,840
the switches whether it's

710
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,520
firewalling virtual or physical

711
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,440
firewalling

712
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,760
whether it's looking at how if you use

713
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,279
particular cloud services how

714
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,360
they would provide that to type of

715
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,640
firewalling capability

716
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,320
within the managed network that they

717
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,000
have

718
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,240
and all of these have inherently you

719
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,039
know uh your operational challenges and

720
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,520
and really efficiency challenges because

721
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,880
they're based typically around all

722
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,559
around kind of the structure of the

723
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,480
network itself rather than the objects

724
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,240
on the network right so

725
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,640
vlans ip ranges subnets zones you know

726
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
the classic way that firewall policy is

727
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,760
built out

728
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,440
we've got challenges when you've got

729
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,679
multi-cloud or hybrid environments where

730
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,679
security controls in one area are not

731
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,520
equal to the security controls in

732
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,159
other areas they don't reach out beyond

733
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,279
the ecosystem that they actually play in

734
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,520
you know whether it's inside a vpc or

735
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,039
between vpcs or even

736
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,159
between clouds most importantly

737
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,919
they all lack visibility visibility of

738
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,679
what's happening what's communicating

739
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,360
with what in the data center

740
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,960
what inbound communications are hitting

741
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,720
each end point or which ones are hitting

742
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,480
each application services

743
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,600
behind those perimeter firewalls

744
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,760
and so the governance or the confidence

745
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,520
in that security posture without really

746
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,440
appreciating what's going on or how

747
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,279
effective those controls are

748
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,520
makes it really really challenging to be

749
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,120
able to state with confidence that

750
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,960
we are isolating and we are doing this

751
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,919
in an effective manner

752
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,840
and this just amplifies with scale

753
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,279
and i know out there there are a lot of

754
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,960
organizations that are always

755
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,240
ever increasing in the number of

756
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,679
services and infrastructure that they're

757
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,400
running

758
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
and whether it's you know thousands of

759
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
servers today or whether it's only

760
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,000
in the order of you know a few hundred

761
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,679
the the ability

762
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,600
to do firewalling in that environment

763
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,840
when you've got really complex rule sets

764
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,520
and rule ordering and

765
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,840
uh all of that you know i'm not really

766
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,279
sure if it's going to work while i'm

767
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,799
typing it in and i'm hoping it's going

768
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,600
to happen

769
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,840
it all kind of leads to these very long

770
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,159
change windows that we all have

771
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,960
it leads to you know internal security

772
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,240
teams becoming

773
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,120
part of that very challenging process

774
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,679
where

775
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,240
an application group says hey i i want

776
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,600
access to something

777
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,840
and it goes through this very complex

778
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,520
sort of sequence of

779
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,200
trying to work out where those things

780
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,279
are and should they be moved or do they

781
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,200
need to be placed somewhere else

782
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
changes in you know vlan structures or

783
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,279
network structures or changes in the way

784
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,240
that you operate

785
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,279
those cloud kind of uh

786
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,919
vpcs or the cloud accounts that you run

787
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,120
how are you going to get through that

788
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,600
there's translation between kind of the

789
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,520
human speak that we all know into the

790
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,679
technical world of what that represents

791
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,120
and then kind of back again and and

792
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,880
more and more often we're seeing that

793
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,960
this just doesn't keep up with the pace

794
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,679
at which

795
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,320
the business is trying to run and it

796
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,840
certainly doesn't keep up with the pace

797
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
that the ransomware or the malware or

798
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,559
the attackers

799
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,760
are targeting you with so we've got to

800
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
kind of change this paradigm

801
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,080
for both uh you know the endpoints and

802
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,000
change the paradigm for the data center

803
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,559
as well

804
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,440
and really actually make it simple

805
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,279
achievable to get to that

806
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:45,039
goal of zero trust

807
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,480
okay so if we're going to look at

808
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,960
segmenting our environment you know

809
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,559
across all of our estate and i'm sure

810
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,240
you guys are thinking what you guys run

811
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,279
and how you run it or

812
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,600
what you may want to run tomorrow in

813
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
terms of how you make it decisions or

814
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,159
infrastructure

815
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,480
decisions regardless of all those

816
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
network fabric choices

817
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
regardless of the cloud that you happen

818
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,080
to use today

819
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,880
we want to want to give visibility to

820
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,159
the devops teams

821
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,559
you know the network the sec-op teams

822
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,000
ultimately the security or the

823
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
governance teams to ensure that

824
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,840
they have confidence that we're going to

825
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,200
inhibit

826
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,640
the reach of malware or ransomware from

827
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,080
spreading

828
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,159
okay and we're going to need a new

829
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,679
security model to kind of achieve that

830
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,600
we need a new simplified way we need a

831
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,640
way that's

832
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,960
agnostic from the network we need a way

833
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,760
that's

834
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,440
independent from those decisions that

835
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,120
we're making on how we run the compute

836
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,320
because otherwise we're just going to be

837
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,600
locked into them and we're going to go

838
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,159
through that

839
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,960
same struggled process of getting change

840
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,440
to happen

841
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,480
so one thing it does is it starts that

842
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,919
new model

843
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,520
it starts with decoupling the security

844
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,159
element

845
00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:09,840
away from the fabric of our environment

846
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,480
perspective of the behavior of that

847
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,159
system or the characteristics of that

848
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,200
system

849
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,360
utilizing metadata that would just

850
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,640
represent

851
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,440
that these systems have this function

852
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,279
they are part of this particular

853
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,880
application or group of applications

854
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,640
and allow us to form that or break that

855
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,200
bond

856
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,159
between those two

857
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,600
okay ultimately under the hood we're

858
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,039
still going to need to do

859
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,039
traffic control so there's still going

860
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,159
to be an element of

861
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,000
firewalling if you like or the ability

862
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
to to limit who can talk to whom

863
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,559
but as operators we don't want to have

864
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,399
to deal with all of that complexity in

865
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,200
achieving it

866
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,440
we want to be able to just describe the

867
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,679
intended behavior of what we want the

868
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,519
systems to do

869
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,200
and then have it kind of done on our

870
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,679
behalf

871
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,960
and to our you know theme of of oz this

872
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,799
year around soaring and automation and

873
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,320
orchestration

874
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,480
it's not about kind of introducing ml

875
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,320
and heuristics and wonderful ai that

876
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,600
sort of automation

877
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,080
it's about allowing you to run a

878
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,279
platform that would

879
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,279
adapt to change in your environment

880
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,960
without you having to make changes

881
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,000
yourself

882
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,640
about introducing that security policy

883
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,039
regardless of where stuff runs

884
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,679
in a fashion that doesn't mean is taking

885
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,120
up all of your time and

886
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,039
dedicated firewall teams and security

887
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,399
teams

888
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,760
so how can we go about looking at this

889
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,679
and we've had some and

890
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,519
the synopsis of this talk introduced

891
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,799
like a few customer names

892
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,640
around how they've done it but i wanted

893
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,440
to kind of look at some simple ways

894
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,120
at which we can start to build security

895
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,279
into our infrastructure by default

896
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,240
rather than it

897
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,360
coming to it after the fact we look at

898
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,120
the various aspects of automation and

899
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,880
the various aspects of the way that

900
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,120
we could simplify that policy to make it

901
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,799
achievable across all of those different

902
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,679
goals

903
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:40,960
so one of the first things that we can

904
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,880
do if you do have

905
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,640
you know teams that are you know driving

906
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,559
infrastructure requesting it through

907
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,919
self-service kind of provisioning

908
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,080
mechanisms in the public cloud there's

909
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,440
many of those different ways that you

910
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,080
might be

911
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,760
you know operating with how they order

912
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,519
infrastructure for new services

913
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,960
but ultimately we'd want to get to a

914
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,440
goal where an application team orders

915
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,640
infrastructure

916
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,799
where the security profile or the

917
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,519
connectivity profile of those servers

918
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,360
is baked into that process

919
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,559
so that when it spins up it comes up

920
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,880
secure by default so how are we going to

921
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,159
go about doing that well

922
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,840
we can start off by embedding

923
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,000
the control or or actually orchestrating

924
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,880
you know activating the control within

925
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,440
the infrastructure itself

926
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,039
if we can get each object on the network

927
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,159
activated acting as

928
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,559
a firewall appropriately acting as a

929
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,360
sensor

930
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,760
to alert us to when this uh this

931
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,799
movement and

932
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,200
the spread occurs then we can be

933
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,799
independent of the environment we can

934
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,960
be independent of whether it's on-prem

935
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
cisco juniper network whether it's a

936
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,159
cloud provider of any particular choice

937
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,440
and that's pretty easy to do because

938
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,799
that's just software running in the

939
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,360
images

940
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,679
of how we boot up our infrastructure

941
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,279
part of the golden image part of the

942
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,880
ansible the chef the

943
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,120
terraform the cloud formation script

944
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,320
whatever it might be

945
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
we're going to bring that control or

946
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,918
activate that control during that

947
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,399
startup process

948
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,359
we can bring to that process initial

949
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,280
security constraints

950
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,040
that make sure that that infrastructure

951
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,040
as soon as it goes live

952
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,800
cannot immediately interact with

953
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,040
anything else within that particular

954
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,879
vlan that it's spun up in or within that

955
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,639
particular vpc that it arrives in

956
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,079
so we're starting off with minimal

957
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,280
connectivity

958
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,199
it's going to need things like ntp and

959
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,199
dns and active directory and all that

960
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,719
kind of core services stuff

961
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,320
that can all be pre-defined and

962
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,839
predetermined and if we can make a

963
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:44,719
system where

964
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,839
that particular new piece of compute

965
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,560
inherits that policy and only the policy

966
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,239
that it's required to operate

967
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,159
then we're starting off immediately in a

968
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,679
situation of

969
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,200
better than what we had which was just

970
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,880
wide open connectivity within the data

971
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
center

972
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,040
if we make it really simple we can help

973
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,400
application teams

974
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,800
actually get to xero trust themselves

975
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,480
give them visibility into all their

976
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,920
traffic within their application

977
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,680
and how those applications talk to each

978
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,440
other they can become part of this

979
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,160
process

980
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,640
you know devsecops really in action

981
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,599
where they can

982
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,280
tighten those policies and bring them to

983
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,960
the fore the security team is no longer

984
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,680
a blocking or an impeding or a change

985
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,240
process

986
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,000
they become a governance agent they

987
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,880
become a yes our policy model is being

988
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,760
enforced and is being accepted and we

989
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,320
can still

990
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,560
introduce and utilize the nature of sock

991
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,599
and analytics and

992
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,359
threat intelligence to make sure that

993
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,040
the policies that we are driving

994
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,640
actually end up becoming that effective

995
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,480
so how can we go about automating some

996
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,720
of this well we can start off by

997
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,040
isolating applications from each other

998
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,880
and in some parts of our automation that

999
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,200
might be as far as we can go

1000
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,599
but we might also want to get to role

1001
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,200
based where we're saying web tiers

1002
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,040
separated from middleware separated from

1003
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,000
database

1004
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,839
where we can even get down to process

1005
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,680
level we want to be able to do this

1006
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,400
in a really simplified fashion and in

1007
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,720
that automated stream

1008
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,800
where application owners can become part

1009
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,040
of that decision process

1010
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,359
we want general security constraints you

1011
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,280
know dev should never talk to pride or

1012
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,760
the new m a activity should never talk

1013
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,119
back to corporate or

1014
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,880
you know vulnerable ports that are well

1015
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,640
known and suddenly being under attack

1016
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,560
uh the utilized by malware we want to

1017
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,240
make sure that those constraints

1018
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,800
get injected into this without changing

1019
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,480
our environment without rebuilding the

1020
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,079
network redesigning

1021
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,920
or going through those complicated

1022
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,560
processes of trying to identify

1023
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,560
exactly how to implement that control

1024
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,240
and this is what it's going to mean to

1025
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,079
get simplified

1026
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,040
segmentation if we can prevent systems

1027
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,560
like this from talking to each other

1028
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,839
we're going to prevent that spread in

1029
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,839
the data center

1030
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,359
so we just kept we're coming a little

1031
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,640
bit close up on time so what i'm going

1032
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,920
to do is just skip ahead a little bit so

1033
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,440
we get some q a we start a little bit

1034
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,240
late

1035
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,800
but ultimately here's a a few really

1036
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,440
important

1037
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,119
aspects to actually make this achievable

1038
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,720
simplify it by attaching

1039
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,960
and focusing on the workload not

1040
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,800
focusing on the network

1041
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,520
not focusing on the environment if we

1042
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,640
can apply policy

1043
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,359
in a consistent manner whether it's

1044
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:24,079
physical

1045
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,119
virtual containerized applications

1046
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,040
the behavior of those systems is the

1047
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,160
important thing

1048
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,640
not the form factor or where it's

1049
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,200
running

1050
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,680
and that's the key to really simplifying

1051
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,560
policy

1052
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,680
focus on the workload to achieve it

1053
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,359
in a zero trust world we'd want to be

1054
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,800
able to build

1055
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,280
policy that reflects what should be

1056
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,160
allowed

1057
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
approve connectivity that should be

1058
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,599
allowed rather than focusing on

1059
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,520
all the things that we don't want to

1060
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,440
happen and we don't want to be hampered

1061
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:53,920
by

1062
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,800
the complexities of should and shouldn't

1063
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,119
all arranged or lined up or ordered

1064
00:37:59,119 --> 00:37:59,680
together

1065
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,240
so we want allow list type policy but

1066
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,000
with an ability to enforce those

1067
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,400
general constraints so that we can get

1068
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,520
to enforcement

1069
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,000
from minute one we can stand up systems

1070
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,800
that are already secured by default

1071
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,119
and in the case where we have brownfield

1072
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:15,920
and we have

1073
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,800
you know a a level of requirement to

1074
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,560
understand what's happening with those

1075
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,520
existing systems

1076
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,240
we need a way to be able to visualize

1077
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,880
map out

1078
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,280
identify those connections and give you

1079
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,079
a way to safely enforce that policy so

1080
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,440
i'm coming up on time i know there's

1081
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,200
some some q a i think that simon's got

1082
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,079
from the window there so we're going to

1083
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,040
take some of that

1084
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,400
don't actually have any questions coming

1085
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,240
in through the app unless anyone's

1086
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,400
put something in yet does anyone in the

1087
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,599
room have any questions

1088
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,880
just because we're running quite short

1089
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,040
on time

1090
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,680
nobody do you mind if i throw you one

1091
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,359
yeah please don't you um put in their

1092
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,800
sort of natural language

1093
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,359
process you know yeah and policy because

1094
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,280
often policy is something that's written

1095
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,520
half of lawyers involved you know at the

1096
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,640
top land and

1097
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,480
security people have to then implement

1098
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,000
that so

1099
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,040
how how is that joining up how natural

1100
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,560
is that language or does everybody need

1101
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,599
some training

1102
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,880
you know in order to understand this

1103
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,720
interface to match it up and do that

1104
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,440
actual

1105
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,520
governance role i think i think the most

1106
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,040
important thing there is that

1107
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,280
you shouldn't need to have to translate

1108
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,440
a desire to the technical implementation

1109
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:21,760
so

1110
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,760
when we talk about policy we would think

1111
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
if we sat around a conference table

1112
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,480
and said how should the web servers in

1113
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,839
application x

1114
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,320
in the production environment talk to

1115
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,400
the database servers in that application

1116
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
in that environment that's how we should

1117
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,240
end up writing policy

1118
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,240
when it comes to network connectivity so

1119
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,520
we want to use the

1120
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,000
the language and the the characteristics

1121
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,800
of those systems

1122
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,160
and then allow software to allow

1123
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,599
engines compute that's not human

1124
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,839
infallible to turn that into you know ip

1125
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,359
address-based firewall rules

1126
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,200
so it's not necessarily really high up

1127
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,800
in terms of you know the

1128
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,119
the the executive policy level but it is

1129
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,640
certainly taking

1130
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,040
uh the the desired behavior of a system

1131
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,720
in the way that we would talk about it

1132
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,640
so is there a like a reference guide of

1133
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,400
language to use and stuff so you can

1134
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,520
match it up easily

1135
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,880
yeah absolutely i think humans tend to

1136
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,720
think in three maybe four dimensions if

1137
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,079
you throw time in there right so

1138
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,720
illumio takes this perspective of

1139
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,280
describing systems in four ways

1140
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,160
and then use those four properties in a

1141
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,920
multi-dimensional fashion to build out

1142
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,960
that policy

1143
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,359
so it's structured but it's flexible to

1144
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,480
describe how you would

1145
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,560
uh you know approach those systems i

1146
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,680
think that's a really important part of

1147
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,720
the whole process yeah

1148
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,800
well in interest of the stream which

1149
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,040
will be cutting off quite hard right now

1150
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,520
uh thank you very much uh for your talk

1151
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,640
everyone thank you

1152
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,160
thank you very much simon yeah for those

1153
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,520
that are interested please come and see

1154
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,160
us at the uh

1155
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,640
the expo booth andrew will be around for

1156
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,000
a few minutes i'm sure

1157
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,839
and i will and yeah we kick off the next

1158
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,440
bit of the stream in five minutes at

1159
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,920
five past

1160
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,839
thanks
